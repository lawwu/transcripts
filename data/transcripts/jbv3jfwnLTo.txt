[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.040]   Welcome, everyone, to the 77th edition
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.360]   of "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.520]   Today, our special guest is Azwath Damodaran,

[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.280]   at New York University, where he teaches corporate finance
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.760]   and equity valuation.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.880]   Azwath is best known among practitioners and academics

[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:43.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.960]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.120]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I am the host
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.120]   of "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.680]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.200]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center

[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.720]   is building a world of well-informed, capable,
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.400]   and empowered investors.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.880]   Visit the Bogle Center at boglecenter.net,

[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.240]   I have a couple of announcements before we get started today.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.240]   The YouTube videos from the 2024 Bogleheads Conference
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.880]   in Minneapolis, Minnesota are now
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.120]   available online at boglecenter.net.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.960]   All of the sessions were recorded,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.400]   and they're all available for free at the Bogle Center
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.320]   website.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.680]   Second, we are very close to signing a contract
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.600]   to have the 2025 conference at a conference center
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.040]   on the Riverwalk in San Antonio the weekend of October 17th
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.400]   through the 19th.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.800]   It's going to be a great conference
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.280]   at a beautiful location.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.160]   I'll provide more information on future podcasts
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.760]   when it becomes available.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.920]   Our guest today on "Bogleheads on Investing"
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.840]   is Aswat Damodaran.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.880]   He is a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.120]   at New York University, where he teaches corporate finance
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.680]   and equity valuation.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.840]   Aswat is known in the investment industry
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.680]   and the academic community as the dean of valuation.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.680]   He has written close to a dozen books,
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.360]   countless academic articles.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.680]   He maintains a blog and maintains an in-depth database
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.120]   on equity valuations around the globe
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.120]   that you can access by searching for Damodaran online.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.720]   Today, we'll be discussing his teachings, the risk-free rate,
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.080]   the equity risk premium, and even getting
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.000]   into how AI is changing finance and maybe changing all of us.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.520]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Aswat Damodaran.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.600]   Welcome to "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.920]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.280]   It's a real pleasure to have you.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.680]   I've been following you for years, your books
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.680]   and teachings, your website.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.680]   You've got a tremendous amount of information
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.000]   there on valuation.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.080]   You're very open with what you publish.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.720]   You want people to learn, and I commend you for that.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.880]   It's a real pleasure to interview you today.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.680]   Thank you.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.160]   I want to start out with who you are, your background.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.880]   I'm a teacher, and I describe myself as a teacher.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.680]   And that's pretty much all I do.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.640]   I don't consult.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.040]   I don't do appraisals for a living.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.040]   I'm not an expert witness.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.560]   I'm a teacher.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.760]   I teach.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.400]   And that's my passion.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.800]   I happen to teach corporate finance and valuation
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.040]   because it's an area which I find fascinating
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.000]   because it's an interplay between numbers and stories
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.560]   and understanding businesses, which I find fascinating.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.320]   But I'm a teacher, first and foremost.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.600]   That's how I describe myself.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.800]   And talk about how you decided you
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.640]   were going to become a teacher.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.320]   I was getting my MBA at UCLA.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.400]   It was 1981, and I was short of money.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.720]   I needed something to cover tuition for the next semester.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.800]   And I took on a job as a TA, expecting
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.840]   it to be just one semester I'd be a TA,
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.880]   then I'll go do what MBAs do.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.080]   That time, you know, go work for an investment bank.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.560]   It was the start of the huge growth in investment banking.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.920]   So I never expected it to be more than just
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.840]   that 15-week assignment of-- it was actually
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.920]   a quarter, a 10-week assignment.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.480]   It was an accounting class, which-- and I don't even
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.840]   like accounting, for those of you who have heard me talk about
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.340]   it.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.880]   It's not a subject I like.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.280]   But I walked into that class expecting
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.520]   to do a TA discussion.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.960]   And 15 minutes in, I didn't know what it was.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.560]   I realized this was what I wanted
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.600]   to do with the rest of my life.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.520]   I mean, I call these moments of grace,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.600]   where essentially you get this signal of, hey,
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.040]   this is what you were meant to do.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.040]   I'm convinced we all get our moments of grace.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.000]   Most of the time, we're too busy to be watching for it.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.360]   I happened to be lucky enough to recognize it.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.080]   And I walked out of that class, said,
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.720]   I'm going to become a teacher.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.440]   And I mean, I could have become a teacher in a high school.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.280]   I could have become one of these teachers
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.560]   who teaches in five different colleges.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.080]   But I'm also lazy.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.000]   And one of the advantages of teaching at a research
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.120]   university is you teach three classes a year.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.760]   That's your teaching load.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.400]   And I said, that's the kind of teaching I'd like to do.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.800]   Because then I can enjoy teaching.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.120]   I won't burn out.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.160]   So I walked up to the seventh floor of UCLA,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.040]   which is where I was getting my MBA,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.280]   into the finance professor's office.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.320]   And I said, I'd like to get a PhD.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.400]   And he asked me, why do you want to get a PhD?
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.160]   And I did not lie.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.600]   I said, I want to become a teacher.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.600]   To me, research is a means to an end.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.160]   It's not the end.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.360]   And I think he was good enough to be OK with it.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.900]   A lot of professors have said, if you
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.600]   don't want to do research, don't do a PhD.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.360]   But I did go on, got my PhD, taught for a couple of years
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.320]   at the University of California at Berkeley
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.560]   as a visiting faculty member, where I taught,
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.280]   I think, six different classes, ranging
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.800]   from traditional corporate finance
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.840]   class to the undergraduates, to a central banking class.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.540]   And I knew nothing about central banking.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.680]   I had to teach myself just enough
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.480]   to stay ahead of the curve.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.480]   And it made me a dabbler.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.120]   I understood that there were things in each class
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.220]   that I could draw on for the other classes.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.680]   And I've always been a generalist.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.280]   I remain one of the few people who
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.760]   teaches across the finance spectrum,
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.600]   because finance has increasingly become specialized.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.920]   I came to NYU in 1986, and they haven't fired me yet.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.360]   So I'm still there.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.240]   You started writing books, oh, back in the 1990s, I believe.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.560]   It was your first book.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.280]   My first book was an evaluation book.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.600]   In fact, it was a huge ego move to put my name on the book,
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.360]   because I remember the publisher said,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.020]   why don't you put your name on the book?
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.600]   And I said, nobody knows who I am.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.680]   Why would you want to do that?
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.400]   Could we put somebody who's better recognized on the book?
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.800]   He said, go ahead, put your name.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.480]   And it's "The Modern Evaluation," 1992.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.920]   I had still not been tenured.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.200]   A dangerous thing to do if you're an academic
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.000]   is to write a book before you get tenure,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.680]   because you're supposed to write papers that get published.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.360]   So that was my first book.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.120]   And then I added to it in corporate finance
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.960]   and investments, and so it kind of extended from there.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.600]   And back in 1998, you published a book
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.480]   with the late Peter Bernstein.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.400]   That must have been an interesting experience
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.520]   for you.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.360]   Peter was a legend.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.000]   Now, I miss what I called Renaissance men,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.920]   people who could talk about different things,
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.880]   extend across disciplines.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.540]   And we used to have quite a few of them,
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.280]   and Peter was a Renaissance man.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.840]   He could talk about economics.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.640]   He could talk about finance.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.200]   He could talk about culture.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.240]   He could talk about politics.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.840]   And it was towards the end of his legendary career.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.960]   It was not really a book that we co-wrote.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.440]   We co-edited.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.600]   So basically, we took other people's articles.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.520]   We each had an article in there.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.040]   So it was a co-edited book.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.880]   It remains the only book I've worked with with somebody else.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.120]   I've never co-authored a book, because I'm a control freak.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.600]   But with Peter, I had no problems doing it,
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   because I learned a great deal from working with him.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.160]   OK, so so far, you're lazy.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.680]   You're a control freak.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.960]   And I also heard you say somewhere
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.840]   that you could never work for somebody else.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.120]   Never.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.400]   I'd be fired.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.120]   You'd be fired.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.240]   You wouldn't make it.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.680]   Couldn't go into corporate world.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.320]   No.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.240]   With your teaching, you started out with these two bookends
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.120]   that you called them.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.120]   One of them was corporate finance,
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.760]   and the other was valuation.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   They remain the two core classes I teach to the MBAs.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.040]   I teach corporate finance to the first year MBAs,
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.280]   and valuation to the second year MBAs.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.000]   And often, they walk into my office,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.080]   say, what's the difference between your two classes?
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.500]   And I have to tell them the truth.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.960]   It's the same class, taught from different perspectives.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   In corporate finance, we look at businesses
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.560]   from the inside out.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.360]   In other words, you look at it as managers,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   as decision makers saying, how do I run a business?
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.680]   In valuation, you look at those same businesses
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.800]   from the outside in.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.840]   So you have less control over the levers.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.440]   So management chooses not to borrow money.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.720]   That's what you're stuck with.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.360]   You can't go in and change things just
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.400]   because you feel like doing it.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.600]   I truly enjoy the corporate finance class
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.720]   more because I get to look at the levers
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.000]   and say, when does it make sense for a company
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.640]   to return cash to its stockholders?
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.600]   When does it make sense to buy back as opposed
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.760]   to paying dividends?
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.400]   Fundamental questions that we face every day
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.360]   when we look at news stories.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.200]   So to me, the two classes are bookends
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.480]   because they represent two very different perspectives
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.680]   on value.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.760]   Now, one talks about how do we change value as managers.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.360]   The other talks about, hey, how much is something worth?
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.880]   And can I get it for a lower price?
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.440]   And we're going to get more into evaluation in a minute.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.040]   But after a while, you also began
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.600]   to think about another area.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.760]   And that was what you call investment philosophies.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.720]   Now, Bogle has called it investment strategies.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.280]   It's a little bit different.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.320]   For us, philosophy is passive or active.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.280]   But you use it in the phrase of different ways of which
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.560]   you can invest portfolios.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.560]   In fact, I'm glad you brought up investment strategies as opposed
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.520]   to philosophies.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.560]   I'll give you an example.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.560]   A strategy is picking low PE stocks.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.760]   That's a strategy.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.280]   A philosophy is believing that boring companies get
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.160]   undervalued by markets because markets like excitement.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.880]   Philosophies build on a market mistake,
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.680]   a belief about how markets work and don't work.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.440]   Strategies are what you use to exploit that philosophy.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.520]   So to me, the two are connected.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.600]   But the reason I use the word philosophy
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.800]   is it started with observing that there
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.640]   are successful investors out there.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.280]   People are successful in markets.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.520]   But they don't all fall into the same bucket.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.560]   So you've got the Warren Buffetts of the world.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.320]   You've got the Peter Lynches of the world.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.360]   You've got the George Soros of the world
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.320]   or the Jim Simons of the world.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.840]   Very different ways of approaching the market,
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.680]   and they succeed.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.800]   So there are two basic facts in markets.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.360]   One is there are very few successful investors
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.440]   in the long term.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.640]   This is a very tough game to make, which is one reason.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.920]   I'm drawn to Jack Bogle because Jack
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.240]   recognised this very early on.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.160]   He said, this is a very tough game to win.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.560]   So why are you expending time and resources
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.000]   trying to win a game where so few people win?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.480]   But those so few people who win, they don't even
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.440]   share the same characteristics.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.280]   Some come from the perspective of,
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.400]   I'm going to buy companies that look cheap
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.800]   relative to what they already have on their books
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.480]   right now, value investors.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.920]   Others come in with a philosophy of growth
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.400]   is what markets get wrong.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.440]   So I'm going to go after growth companies.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.760]   Still others say, look, markets are where you have to go.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.760]   You have to tie markets.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.360]   So basically, you've got Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch,
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.400]   and George Soros.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.800]   They're already in terms of very different philosophies.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.760]   And rather than say, this is the best philosophy, which
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.400]   happens to be what you will find if you walk into a bookstore,
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.800]   if there are any left, and you walk to the investing section,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.840]   you will find philosophies blaring out
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.640]   that they're the chosen ones.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.200]   It's one reason why I'm uncomfortable in Omaha,
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.040]   Nebraska, is because the investors show up there,
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.480]   old-time value investors think they're the chosen one.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.720]   They have the high ground.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.440]   And I don't think that's true, because there are hundreds
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.280]   of books on Warren Buffett.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.600]   But if you look at all the people who've read those books
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.960]   and tried to imitate him, almost none of them
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.120]   deliver the same kind of returns.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.640]   In fact, I'll wager, collectively,
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.440]   if you took all those investors who show up
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.200]   in Omaha every year, and you look at the returns
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.080]   that they've made on their investments
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.000]   that they've underperformed the Vanguard 500 Index Fund,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.920]   even though they claim to be true believers.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.480]   So I start with a different question.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.880]   I said, look, there are a few successful investors.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.360]   There are relatively few.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.920]   There reigns a spectrum.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.120]   What is it that they brought to the table other than luck,
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.320]   which we can never discount, that made them successful?
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.640]   So my investment philosophies class starts with that premise.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.520]   There is no one right investment philosophy for everyone,
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.120]   but there's one right one for you, given your makeup,
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.920]   given what you bring to the table.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.720]   And that one right philosophy
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.760]   might be to be a passive investor.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.840]   One of the great things about investing
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.160]   is you can effortlessly beat the average active investor
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.000]   by putting your money in index funds.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.360]   - And that's the philosophy of most Bogle heads.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.400]   I mean, people have their, what I call,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.480]   bingo money account, fund money account.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.320]   They might use a Roth IRA or something
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.800]   and pick a few stocks.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.800]   But generally, 90% to 100% of their investments
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.840]   are in just US stock, total market index fund
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.880]   and international stock index fund.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.320]   A couple of bond funds or maybe just treasuries
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.160]   on the bond side.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.200]   I mean, it's very simple, simplistic, low cost.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.520]   But we always love to learn.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.040]   So we're always interested in what everybody else is doing.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.400]   We may not do that,
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.360]   but we're interested in learning about it.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.080]   So this is the investment philosophies class that you teach.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.040]   But most recently, your last book
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.240]   was on investment lifecycle.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.880]   Let's talk about your interest in that
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.280]   and how you evolved into writing a book about that.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.560]   - No, it's corporate life cycles.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.640]   It's about how businesses age like human beings do
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.800]   and how they fight aging like human beings do.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.600]   Which is, you know, you don't want to get old.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.200]   So consultants and bankers tell you you can be young again.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.200]   So you try to do an acquisition, enter a new business.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.520]   And it's a structure I've used in my corporate finance,
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.600]   my valuation, my investment philosophies class
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.680]   as long as I've taught it.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.640]   So this is not a new topic.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.240]   It's a structure that I've used in all my classes
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.920]   that I find incredibly useful in understanding
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.280]   why companies behave the way they do,
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.080]   especially as they age.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.680]   So corporate lifecycle book is about tracking
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.440]   that aging process and how companies change
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.040]   or they should change as they age.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.720]   The kind of decisions they make,
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.720]   what they should focus on as companies should change.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.600]   And as investors, there's a lesson there as well.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.880]   Is I'll give you an example.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.920]   You know, you buy into old-time value investing.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.600]   Old-time value investing says you should buy a company
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.680]   for less than what it has as assets on its books.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.720]   So you look at the Ben Graham 12 screens
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.360]   for finding a cheap stock.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.240]   It's about looking at what a company owns
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.240]   and saying, I want to buy it at 50% of that value.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.920]   Good luck finding it, but that's what you're looking for.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.600]   If you adopt that strategy or you go with that philosophy,
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.480]   then you know where you're going to end up with the lifecycle.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.440]   You're going to end up with a lot of mature
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.960]   and declining companies in your portfolio.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.560]   You're going to end up with the Kraft Heins or Coca-Cola's,
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.840]   the three M's of the world,
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.080]   because those are the companies
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.560]   we have a chance of doing it.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.560]   You're never going to be buying Palantir or even Facebook
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.720]   or definitely not Nvidia
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.240]   because it'll always look expensive to you.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.160]   Now you have to be okay with that.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.240]   I mean, we know what Warren Buffett's biggest lament
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.720]   has been over his lifetime,
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.880]   which is he never invested in tech when it was young.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.240]   I mean, Bill Gates was one of his best friends
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.600]   and he never invested in Microsoft along the way.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.000]   I know the investor now, Berkshire Hathaway,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.480]   invested in Apple finally in 2017,
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.280]   but by that time, Apple was a mature company.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.240]   But the reality is that's a feature, not a bug,
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.680]   of the Buffett investment philosophy.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.720]   It's one of the side costs of focusing so much
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.880]   on what's on the ground right now
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.520]   is you're never going to buy a growth company.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.440]   And the problem with that is we might be entering a century
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.120]   where the cost of not having growth companies
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.720]   in your portfolio could be catastrophic.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.000]   Let's take an example.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.520]   In the last 15 years,
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.640]   if you didn't own any of the Fangam stocks
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.640]   or any of the Mag 7, as they're called now,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.280]   the chance of you beating the market became minuscule
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.040]   because those seven companies by themselves
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.840]   have accounted for 15% of the increase in market cap
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.360]   of all US stocks, 7,000 stocks,
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   in the last 15 years have come from the seven companies.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.640]   If you don't have those seven companies in your portfolio,
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.440]   how the heck are you going to beat the market?
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.000]   Conversely, if you're an index fund investor,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   you benefited, right?
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.720]   Because all you have to do is buy the index,
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.600]   you're going to get those seven companies.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.840]   So it's actually made the case
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.920]   for passive investing even stronger
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.640]   because if you're an active investor
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.440]   and you end up with a philosophy
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.880]   that leaves those companies out,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.200]   you're going to have a tough time beating the market.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.160]   - I was reading a stat that said 25 years ago,
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.320]   they listed out the top 10 companies on the S&P
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.960]   and the only one company that's still in there is Microsoft.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.880]   All the other nine companies are gone.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.080]   They've rotated out.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.200]   So the kind of the glory of passive investing
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.040]   is you know that your portfolio
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.960]   is always going to hold those top 10 stocks.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.800]   - Yeah.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.400]   - Okay, I want to move a little bit here
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.240]   and begin to ask you some questions
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.760]   pertaining to what you teach.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.560]   So this is Valuation 101
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.760]   and I want to go over some terms
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.720]   so that everybody understands where they come from.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.320]   First, what is a risk-free rate?
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.320]   - It's what you can make guaranteed.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.240]   So take your whatever brokerage account you have.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.960]   I'm sure everybody in the audience has some money in cash.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.800]   What's the highest rate of return
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.320]   you can make guaranteed on that cash?
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.400]   I'll tell you what it is for me.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.520]   I go into the treasury auction.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.800]   You can actually buy T-bills directly.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.640]   I don't put my money in money market funds,
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.760]   but you know, you could do that.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.240]   You get pretty close.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.640]   And I feel almost certain,
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.040]   in fact, let me take the almost out.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.960]   I feel certain that six months from now
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.280]   when I cash out my T-bills,
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.880]   I'm going to get that 4.7 or 5%
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.560]   I was promised when I invested up front.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.720]   It's guaranteed.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.120]   The one catch there,
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.760]   it's assuming that the U.S. Treasury will not default.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.560]   And for a century or more,
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.520]   we've assumed that that's true.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.400]   One of the shakier things about
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.120]   what's happened in the last 10 years
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.400]   is the U.S. government has walked up,
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.240]   walked to the precipice of defaulting,
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.760]   mostly for political reasons, not economic reasons,
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.480]   because that, you know, you've got to put the debt limit,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.280]   you've got to increase it, Congress has to vote on it.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.880]   So there's this residue of doubt now
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.000]   on whether the U.S. Treasury is truly default free.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.200]   But for something to be risk-free,
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.320]   it's got to be default-free and guaranteed.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.320]   So it can't be a corporate bond.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.400]   It can't be a government bond if the government can't default.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.960]   So it's got to be as close as you can get to that.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.040]   U.S. dollars, that's going to probably be
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.280]   a Treasury bond rate.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.800]   I use longer-term rates if you want to lock it in,
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.320]   compare it to stocks.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.280]   So it becomes the number you compare
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.880]   to what you can generate on stocks,
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.400]   saying, "Should I be investing in stocks?"
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.640]   So even if you're a bogelhead and invest passively,
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.240]   one of the decisions you've got to make
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.160]   is how much money do I invest in my equity index fund
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.120]   as opposed to, and this is the decision that drives that.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.560]   - You talked about T-bills.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.440]   Other people use the 10-year Treasury.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.360]   Other people use TIPS.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.600]   - I would use the 10-year Treasury.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.480]   I don't use T-bills.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.080]   And the reason is very simple.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.120]   Stocks are a long-term investment.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.120]   So it's not that the T-bill is not risk-free,
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.880]   but it's risk-free for three months or six months.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.680]   You're comparing investing in equities,
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.120]   which is a long-term investment choice.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.760]   You want to compare it to something that's long-term.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.560]   The reason TIPS doesn't even enter the equation
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.920]   is the return on stocks is a nominal return.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.360]   TIPS are a real return.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.480]   You're comparing apples to oranges.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.960]   If you want to convert what you expect to make on stocks
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.000]   into a real return, take out the inflation component,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.520]   you can compare to TIPS.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.960]   But you can't compare to T-bills
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.680]   because the duration is mismatched
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.320]   and you can't compare to TIPS
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.480]   because you're comparing a nominal to a real.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.960]   So I use 10-year T-bonds,
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.080]   and that's the easiest of all numbers
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.000]   to pull out of the market,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.840]   know exactly where it is at every point of every day.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.560]   So it becomes my comparison point
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.240]   for should I be investing in equities in the first place?
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.400]   - So now we get to the equity side,
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.960]   and we've all heard the term the equity risk premium,
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.960]   which you have gotten this name as the Dean of Valuation.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.040]   And part of this is you monthly come up
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.920]   with the equity risk premium.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.920]   So first define what an equity risk premium is.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.680]   - Okay, right now the T-bond rate is 4.4%.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.920]   So today if you put your money in a 10-year T-bond,
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.960]   assuming the U.S. Treasury is default free,
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.760]   you can make 4.4% guarantee.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.360]   I come to you with the S&P 500.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.880]   Let's keep it an index where we at least know
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.480]   that we're talking about the same thing.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.120]   I want you to take your money out of the T-bond
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.280]   and put it into the S&P 500.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.440]   The question I'm asking you is how much higher
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.040]   would the expected return need to be for you to switch?
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.520]   Why does it have to be higher?
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.280]   Because the T-bond you're guaranteed that 4.4%.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.960]   With the S&P 500, it's not guaranteed.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.520]   You'd need to earn more than 4.4% to move your money.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.880]   How much more is your equity risk premium?
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.760]   So you can already see that this is a number
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.360]   that'll vary across people.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.560]   If you're risk-averse and you're worried about risk,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.280]   you might say, "I need 6% more than the T-bond rate."
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.400]   Your neighbor, who's much more risk-taking,
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.640]   might say, "I'll settle for 3%."
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.720]   So you can already see that this is a number
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.440]   that'll vary across people.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.600]   And I'm trying to estimate it for the entire market,
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.880]   which is millions and millions of people.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.760]   So this sounds like an incredibly difficult task.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.600]   And for the longest time, people gave up on it.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.480]   They looked backwards.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.200]   They said, "Over the last 70 years, I'd have made 5%.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.440]   Therefore, that's my equity risk premium."
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.800]   But that's like driving 80 miles down a highway,
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.040]   looking in the rear-view mirror.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.840]   It's not going to end well.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.120]   So starting about 30 years ago, I'd said,
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.320]   "Look, I'd like to figure out what the market is demanding
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.400]   as an equity risk premium."
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.000]   It's not a formula or an equation.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.680]   It's basically an internal rate-of-return calculation.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.000]   I know what you paid for stocks.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.160]   I can see what the expected cash flows are for stocks.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.440]   The S&P 500 is the most tracked and followed index.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.040]   I can see the expected earnings.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.400]   I can come up with the expected cash flows.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.000]   If I know what you paid for stocks
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.160]   and the expected cash flows,
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.000]   I can solve for what discount rate
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.400]   makes the present value of the cash flows
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.040]   equal to the level of the index today.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.560]   It's the way we compute yield to maturity on a bond.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.480]   I do that at the start of every month.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.880]   At the start of December of 2024,
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.800]   that number was 8.25%.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.320]   You're saying, "What the heck does that even mean?"
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:27.320]   If you bought U.S. equities at the start of December 2024,
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.640]   a week ago, two weeks ago,
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.840]   you were building in an expected return of 8.25%.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.200]   Uncle, what you hoped you would make,
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.280]   what you prayed you would make,
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.480]   the very act of buying at that price.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.120]   The T bond rate on that day was 4.18%.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.680]   You were earning 4.07% over the T bond rate.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.600]   Are you happy with it?
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.000]   If you say no, you know what the answer to that is, right?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.280]   You shouldn't be putting your money in equities
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.440]   because you want a higher return.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.320]   So every discussion about stocks,
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.240]   whether they're in a bubble,
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.800]   whether they're too high or low,
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.840]   can be reframed as a discussion
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.240]   about what do you think a fair equity risk premium is.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.120]   If you think it's 6%,
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.040]   you should definitely be out of stocks.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.400]   If you think it's 2%,
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.800]   you should be doubling down on stocks.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.120]   But the number is the number.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.720]   It's what you're paying right now.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.480]   That 4.07% becomes the benchmark
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.440]   for what the market is demanding of you.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.640]   - When you're looking at the expectation of return,
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.920]   how does growth factor into that,
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.000]   the growth of our earnings and growth of the economy?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.840]   - Yeah, so you have expected earnings,
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.600]   but earnings can't be paid out as dividends.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.400]   Or put differently, it can be paid out.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.560]   If you paid all of the earnings out as dividends,
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.320]   you're reinvesting nothing.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.600]   If you reinvest nothing, you can't grow in the long term.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.680]   So if I take earnings and treat them
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.000]   as expected cash flows from buying stocks,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.960]   the only growth rate that's compatible with it
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.120]   is a 0% growth rate.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.960]   So here's what I do.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.560]   I take earnings, I build in expectations of growth,
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.000]   and then I pause and say,
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.240]   well, how much are companies reinvesting
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.760]   to deliver that growth?
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.920]   And with the S&P 500, it's observable.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.160]   You can look at what companies are putting back.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.040]   So the growth enters into the equation in two ways.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.520]   One is a growth rate in earnings.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.240]   That's a good side.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.720]   But it also enters your cash flows
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.640]   as what you're reinvesting to deliver that growth.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.520]   That's a bad side.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.200]   The net effect is what shows up in my equity risk premium.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.600]   - And you do this monthly for the U.S. market,
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.480]   but you also do it for markets all around the world.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.200]   And you put this on your website.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.400]   - And there's a reason I do that.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.400]   There are no U.S. companies anymore.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.400]   They're multinationals that happened
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.720]   through the accident of history to be U.S.-based.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.280]   Coca-Cola is Atlanta-based,
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.960]   but it gets 60% of its revenues outside the U.S.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.000]   Why does that matter?
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.840]   Your risk as a company doesn't come
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.200]   from where you're incorporated.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.560]   It comes from where you operate.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.280]   So if you're looking at a multinational,
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.800]   I need to know what the equity risk premium is for Asia,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.560]   Africa, Latin America to value Coca-Cola,
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.880]   to value GM, to value Tesla, to value Apple.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.640]   Almost all of the data you see on my website,
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.520]   I created because I needed it.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.560]   It was completely selfish.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.600]   And once I estimated for myself,
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.000]   I said, what's the point of keeping it to myself?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.200]   It's not like this is rocket science.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.320]   This is not some secret I want to keep from everybody.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.760]   So that equity risk premium data
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.080]   by country reflects what I started doing 30 years ago
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.240]   because I was valuing U.S. companies with foreign exposures.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.160]   I've increasingly started valuing foreign companies as well.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.280]   And there it becomes incredibly useful.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.680]   If the growth in the next decade is going to come from India,
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.880]   don't you need to track
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.360]   what the Indian equity risk premium is doing
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.400]   as frequently as you can to value Indian companies?
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.320]   So I think we have no choice.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.520]   Globalization, whether we like it or not,
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.600]   is here to stay, in investing, in valuation,
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   in corporate finance, and we need to be ready for it.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.800]   And that becomes one of the ingredients you need
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.240]   to deal with country risk across the globe.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.920]   - We have the U.S. equity risk premium,
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.240]   as you said, is a little bit over 4%.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.280]   So, you know, somebody who's investing
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.840]   in a total stock market index fund
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.040]   who may have a little bit of a few basis points of fees,
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.040]   call it 4%.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:14.880]   - Yeah.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.240]   - What is it outside the U.S.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.080]   if you were going to combine all of these countries together?
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.200]   What should we be expecting from international stocks?
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.560]   Is it different than 4?
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.880]   - In Northern Europe, you're going to get about 4.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.720]   Why?
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.440]   Because they're mature markets.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.560]   And if the equity risk premium in Northern Europe
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.880]   was significantly different from the U.S.,
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.120]   let's say 6% in Germany, here's what would happen.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.720]   Money would leave the U.S., go into German stocks,
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   push prices up, and push returns down.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.040]   So across economies that are mature,
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.960]   the U.S. equity risk premium becomes this number
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.400]   that ties together those markets.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.120]   So if I'm looking at Germany,
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.360]   I'm looking at Scandinavian countries,
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.520]   I'm looking at Australia, I'm looking at Singapore,
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.000]   I'm looking at Canada,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.960]   I'm using the 4% as my equity risk premium.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.080]   But if I'm going to Brazil, or India, or Indonesia,
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.240]   or parts of Africa to invest in,
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.880]   my equity risk premium needs to be higher.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.720]   Why?
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.200]   Because I'm exposed to more risk that is country-specific.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.720]   So it's a very simple exercise.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.320]   You start with the U.S. premium,
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.760]   you assign it to what you think are mature markets,
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.480]   you know, mostly AAA-rated, mostly safe.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.600]   And then you attach an extra premium
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.240]   for countries that you think are riskier,
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.760]   not because, you know, you're being paranoid,
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.640]   but because you know there'll be shocks in these markets.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.240]   You can't do this after the fact.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.800]   You've got to bring in your expectations of risk
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.360]   before the fact, build them into your pricing.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.400]   So when that surprise happens,
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.440]   you've got some fat you've built up
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.880]   that you can use to burn off.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:50.160]   - I want to get into your views on factor investing,
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.520]   quantitative analysis.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.840]   And to you going, "Hum, hum, hum."
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.680]   - Yeah.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.800]   - You know, there's this debate.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.880]   Oh, it's mispricing.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.480]   No, it's risk.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.400]   I want to hear your views on this.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.160]   - It's funny because many of the people
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.160]   who are so-called factor investors
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.000]   come to the game with contempt for academic finance,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.720]   which is efficient markets, who cares about it?
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.080]   You know, the birthplace of factor investing
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.680]   was a paper by Gene Farmer,
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.160]   who's essentially the father of efficient markets,
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.320]   and Ken French.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.840]   That Farmer-French paper came up with the first two factors,
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.480]   market gaps, small cap companies on higher returns
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.000]   and large cap companies,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.320]   and low price-to-book companies on higher returns
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.520]   and high price-to-book.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.480]   That was 1992.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.120]   In the decades since, as data has proliferated,
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.320]   the number of factors that seem to make
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.120]   these excess returns higher than they should
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.680]   has also multiplied.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.760]   It's called the factor zoo at this point.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.560]   There are dozens and dozens of factors,
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.480]   all of which on paper seem to beat the market.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.080]   But here's my problem with it.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.480]   First, Farmer-French, in their original paper
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.320]   on market cap and price-to-book,
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.680]   didn't claim that this was a sign of market efficiency.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.040]   They said this is a sign
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.120]   that our models for risk and return are flawed,
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.040]   that there's something about small companies
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.120]   that makes them riskier
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.760]   that we're not capturing in our models.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.720]   So they actually took the paper to mean
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.880]   that markets are efficient,
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.280]   we were just not capturing it in the risk.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.640]   But the people outside took those same papers
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.440]   and said, let's create a small cap fund.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.920]   Let's create a value fund.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.960]   Saying that'll beat the market.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.680]   But let's take that and run with it.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.800]   Let's assume factors actually work,
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.680]   that they deliver higher returns.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.920]   It's not a case for active investing.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.160]   It's a case for buying low-price-to-book stocks
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.720]   or small companies.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.160]   So here's what's happened in the last 20 years.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.520]   You had active investors start small cap funds
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.200]   and an index fund of just small cap stocks.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.040]   And guess what?
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.920]   The index fund beat the active investors.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.320]   So-called value investing
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.920]   that beat the market in the last century,
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.200]   almost all of it came from buying low-price-to-book stocks.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.160]   In the last 20 years, you had index funds
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.360]   that are value index funds
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.080]   that buy the low-price-to-book stocks without any cost
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.120]   and they beat the active investors.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.040]   To me, the promise factor investing
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.240]   is even if factors deliver these excess returns,
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.400]   I can get them effortlessly
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.320]   by buying an index fund around those factors.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.440]   It's not a case for active investing.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.960]   It's a case for more nuanced passive investing.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.560]   Don't put all of your money in the S&P 500 index fund.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.400]   Spread it out across a value index fund,
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.480]   a growth index fund, an emerging market index fund,
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.440]   and you will be beating active investors
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.320]   in each of these spaces.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.040]   I have another reason why I am wary
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.440]   when an active investor says,
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.160]   "I'm an active investor and I invest based on factors."
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.480]   Now, I was saying, if you bring nothing to the table,
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.920]   you should expect to take nothing away.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.040]   So if you're an active investor
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.720]   and your claim to fame is,
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.760]   "I can find low-price-to-book stocks
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.680]   "and earn high returns in equity,"
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.040]   the Bruce Grunwald approach to picking stocks,
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.640]   my response is, "Why do I need you?
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.560]   "I could get, in today's day and age,
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.720]   "I could get an AI to do that for me.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.720]   "It'll cost me absolutely nothing.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.680]   "Why would I be paying you 100 basis points
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.880]   "or 150 basis points to do something
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.000]   "that I can do effortlessly?"
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.880]   So first, I'm not sure the factors
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.480]   actually deliver excess returns
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.680]   because much of that factor excess return
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:23.360]   comes from looking at US data going back to 1927.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.440]   And if you look at US data going back to 1927,
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.960]   there's a cleavage in the middle.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.560]   1927 through 1980 looks very different
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.920]   from 1980 through 2024.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.960]   Take the small-cap premium.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.400]   Huge between 1927 and 1980, almost 7%.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.560]   Since 1980, there's been no small-cap premium, none.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.680]   It's zero, it's gone.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.680]   Value investing, low-priced-to-book stocks
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.320]   delivered higher returns than high-priced-to-book stocks
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:55.000]   in the last century, 1927 through 1990, maybe even 2000.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.040]   The last 24 years, low-priced-to-book stocks
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.520]   have underperformed high-priced-to-book stocks.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.160]   We might be chasing mirages out there with these factors,
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.200]   charging people for chasing them
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.440]   and not delivering any returns.
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.240]   - Once these papers are published
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.600]   and fund companies and asset managers
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.920]   start piling into these strategies,
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.360]   doesn't it change the dynamics of the market itself
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.320]   and change valuations?
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.960]   - Less so with factors than with specific event studies.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.200]   For instance, there are studies that show
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.600]   that when a company gets added to the S&P 500,
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.520]   it gets a jump in price.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.720]   That's an indexing effect.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.360]   It's an event study.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.360]   Those event studies, once people agree
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.800]   that there is an event effect,
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.280]   seem to disappear very quickly
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.080]   because then people say, "Okay, if that's going to happen
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.160]   "and I know that Tesla is going to get added
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.040]   "to the S&P 500 next week,
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.400]   "I'm going to start buying Tesla before it actually happens."
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.400]   It's less so with factors because I'm convinced
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.640]   that at least between 1927 and '80,
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.160]   there were good reasons why small cap companies
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.720]   earned what looked like excess returns.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.400]   Information on them was difficult to get.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.120]   There were all kinds of corporate governance issues.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.600]   Transacting on them.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.560]   I'm old enough to remember when I had to call a broker
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.560]   to buy a stock.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.600]   And if you tried to call a broker
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.840]   to buy a small NASDAQ stock in 1980,
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.280]   the hoops you had to jump through,
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.560]   the costs you faced were insanely high.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.440]   One of the things that changed
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.080]   is we live in a very different world.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.840]   And maybe the reason the small cap premium has disappeared
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.160]   is I can go to the SEC website,
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.120]   pull up the last 20 years of financials
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.800]   for even the smallest company,
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.560]   and I can trade effortlessly through my broker's house.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.600]   Slightly higher bid-ask spread.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.120]   But the difference has been small and large companies.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.440]   From an investor perspective, I've narrowed.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.280]   And if they've narrowed,
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.440]   maybe the small cap premium has disappeared
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.840]   for a good reason.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.600]   So some of these factors, I think,
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.080]   had good reasons for the original premiums.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.240]   They were not excess returns.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.120]   They were returns for something that you were facing
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.280]   that you were not capturing in your models.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.160]   And I think those factors have shifted
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.360]   because we live in a very different world as investors,
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.360]   and we're capturing that in our returns.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.160]   - Well, thank you for that discussion.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.440]   I appreciate it because the Bogleheads
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.760]   are always talking about,
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.720]   should we follow factor investing?
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.200]   How smart is smart beta?
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.040]   And so forth.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.360]   I mean, these come up all the time.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.480]   I do want to get into another area
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.360]   that you have discussed frequently.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.400]   In fact, you wrote a book on it.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.480]   It's "The Difference Between Equations and Models
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.920]   and Stories."
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.920]   You have come to a medium between the numbers
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.680]   and the stories.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.680]   There's earnings, there's dividends, cash flows,
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.760]   and then there's a lot of things out there that don't,
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.640]   but they still deserve a value.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.760]   So can you talk about this whole area?
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.560]   - I mean, it's really the recognition
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.760]   that when you value a business,
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.400]   you're always telling a story.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.120]   It's a story about that business.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.200]   It might show up as numbers.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.960]   It's growth and margins and reinvestment.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.080]   But one of my pet peeves with valuation
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.600]   as it's evolved has become financial modeling,
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.280]   an Excel spreadsheet.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.240]   I've seen equity research analysts take a company
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.480]   and have the working capital requirements.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.400]   Easy to do on a spreadsheet.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.680]   And my response is,
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.000]   have you ever worked at a retail business
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.760]   where you've tried to have inventory?
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:25.680]   What does that mean?
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.080]   Are you going to take four of the eight colors out?
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.440]   Are you going to have fewer items?
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.760]   There's a cost involved here that you're not factoring in.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.920]   What telling a story forces you to do
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.480]   is think about what it is that you need to do
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.320]   as a business to deliver that 5% extra growth.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.640]   Where's that growth going to come from?
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.880]   What are you going to do?
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.640]   So connecting stories, numbers,
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.760]   makes you more disciplined in how you approach companies.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.000]   You can't just arbitrarily raise the growth rate for Nvidia
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.080]   to get to the price you want to.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.560]   Because the question I'm going to ask you is,
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.520]   where is that additional growth going to come from?
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.280]   The entire AI chip business is going to be $500 billion,
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.160]   and you're giving Nvidia $700 billion in revenues.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.640]   Where's the extra $200 billion going to come from?
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.080]   So it makes you think about businesses
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.600]   that underlie your spreadsheets.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.240]   And that makes you more restrained
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.280]   in changing numbers you don't like
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.200]   to get whatever value you want to get in your valuation.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.680]   So I want to move into areas that have no cash flows,
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:27.360]   commodities, gold, fine art, Bitcoin.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.480]   How do you put a value on these things
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.240]   when they have no cash flow?
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.840]   You can only price them.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.360]   I make a big deal.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.560]   And my valuation class,
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.880]   they get sick and tired of me doing this.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.280]   Do you want to value something
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.360]   or do you want to price something?
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.880]   To value something, you need cash flows that come from it.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.000]   You can value a gold mining company,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.560]   but you can't value gold.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.760]   You can value Coinbase
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.760]   because it's a transaction-based company
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.320]   and there is revenues you get from the transactions,
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.000]   but you can't value Bitcoin.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.360]   You can only price it.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.760]   What's price driven by?
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.640]   Demand and supply.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.560]   What's demand and supply driven by?
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.600]   Mood and momentum.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.320]   I mean, look at what's happened to Bitcoin this year.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.080]   You could point to a series of events
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.120]   that have caused the price to go up above 100,000,
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.800]   but it's mood and momentum.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.640]   It's a pricing game.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.880]   There's nothing wrong with it,
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.320]   but recognizing you're playing a pricing game
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.600]   will make you more honest about what you're doing.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.920]   You cannot be an investor in Bitcoin,
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.280]   but you can trade Bitcoin.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.600]   So when people say, "I'm going to add Bitcoin to my portfolio,"
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.640]   I say, "Okay, go ahead."
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.600]   But remember, that's your pricing component.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.440]   There's no intrinsic value.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.560]   It's going to be based on demand and supply,
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.000]   and you've got to get really good then
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.760]   at detecting shifts in mood and momentum
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.320]   and getting ahead of the game.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.360]   So I have lots of respect for traders.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.880]   They play the pricing game,
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.520]   but it's a very different game
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.640]   than one that tries to assess value
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.360]   and base decisions based on value.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.680]   - And what about venture capital
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.160]   or companies that might have just gone public,
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.560]   say quantum computer companies that have no,
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.160]   I mean, they have revenue, but they've become profitable.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.800]   You're talking 10 years down the road.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.400]   I mean, how do you value that?
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.120]   - Making a lot of estimates, right?
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.320]   There's no difference between valuing a Coca-Cola
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.600]   and valuing a Palantir.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.720]   The difference is that you don't have
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.320]   the crutch of past data.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.600]   You don't have the crutch of knowing
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.520]   what the business model is in making your estimates.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.080]   In both cases, the future that drives value,
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.640]   not the past, but in the Coca-Cola case,
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.400]   you have a lot of past drawn.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.240]   It gives you a way of justifying your estimates
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.800]   and pointing to something when something goes wrong
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.000]   because, you know, I base it on past growth rates.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.120]   Don't blame me.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.200]   You don't have that luxury with a young growth company.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.600]   That makes people uncomfortable.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.480]   So you know what happens.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.760]   They don't value these companies,
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.960]   including the people who claim to value the companies.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.280]   People like VCs, they price companies.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.360]   How do they price them?
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.560]   Price per user.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.360]   Market cap per subscriber.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.680]   Basically, they're pricing on a metric
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.480]   where they hope to sell to somebody else
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.320]   based on the same metric.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.760]   Nothing wrong with it, but it is what it is.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.520]   - Price per click, I remember.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.960]   - Price per click, exactly.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.680]   - So you yourself, when you invest,
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.680]   you have a portfolio of about 40 individuals
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.200]   stocks that you buy.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.400]   I'm not gonna ask you what they are
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.360]   because we don't want to go down that road,
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:25.360]   but I'd like you to talk about why you have this portfolio
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.040]   and what is your interest in doing
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.600]   a little portfolio management on the side for yourself?
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.480]   - I love investing.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.440]   I love companies.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.680]   I love understanding them.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.640]   I don't do it because I hope to beat the market.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.280]   I follow the Hippocratic oath.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:43.480]   I try to do as little harm to myself as possible.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.160]   Now, what does that involve?
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.760]   I don't trade very often.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.880]   I add probably two or three companies,
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.440]   maybe four in a big year to my portfolio.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.560]   I sell maybe two or three companies,
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.840]   maybe four in a big year.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.480]   I am not constantly tracking the market.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.640]   I'm not trying to get ahead of an information announcement.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.760]   So I try to trade as little.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.600]   I mean, let's face it.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.920]   One of the lessons we've learned
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   from looking at active investing
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.680]   is the more activity you have,
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.200]   the more difficult it becomes for you to beat the market.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:18.360]   So I try to be as passive as I can much of the time.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.640]   Second, if at the end of the next 40 or 50 years,
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.640]   and I've said this before,
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.400]   on my deathbed, you came to me and said,
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.520]   look, based on what you did over the last 50 years,
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.800]   you delivered half a percent less
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.440]   than you could have made investing in index funds.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.480]   I'd be completely okay with that.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.760]   I don't feel righteous in this.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.520]   I don't feel I deserve to get an excess return
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.440]   'cause I did all the right things.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.920]   I do it because I enjoy it.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.800]   And I do it in a way where I don't think
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.560]   I will trail the market by three, four, five, 6%
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.600]   in any given year because that's not my strategy.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.800]   Notice I have 40 stocks.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.200]   I don't have four or five
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.560]   because I believe concentration
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.680]   is violating the Hippocratic oath in investing.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.880]   Because when you put your money in four or five stocks,
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.040]   in a great year, you might be up 200%.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.320]   You could have something to boast about at cocktail parties.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.120]   In a bad year, you could lose 40%.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.920]   I'd never enter with a position
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.640]   that's greater than 5% of my portfolio.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.800]   I'd never let any company in my portfolio
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.880]   exceed 15% of my portfolio,
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.880]   which means I've got to shed some winners.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.600]   I've sold in video over the last three years.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.200]   And people say, "Aren't you upset about the fact
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.000]   that you've left a lot of money in the table?"
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.760]   Not in the least.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.400]   Because I have to play the game I came to play.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.240]   In my game, if I let a company
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.560]   become more than 15% of my portfolio,
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.240]   I risk violating that do-no-harm oath that I took
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.240]   when I started the active investing path.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.920]   - So I want to talk about a portfolio
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.280]   that is very common for the Bogleheads.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.600]   And I just want to get your initial reaction to it.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.040]   It's called the three-fund portfolio.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.960]   Let's say that you've decided your asset allocation
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.280]   between stocks and bonds is going to be
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.880]   60% in stocks and 40% in bonds.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.680]   So the three-fund portfolio would be
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:11.320]   40% in a total U.S. stock market index fund,
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.120]   20% in a total international index fund,
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:19.920]   and then 40% in a total bond market index fund.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.480]   What do you think about that?
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.080]   - The only thing I would take issue with
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.960]   is that mix staying the same for everybody.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.040]   - Granted, yes.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.600]   - If you're 25 years old,
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   I'd expect that mix to be more equities, less bonds,
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.400]   simply because you don't need that income.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.760]   Why pay taxes on income you don't need?
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.960]   I would tilt it more towards equities.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:39.800]   - Yes.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.840]   - And as you get older,
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.360]   assuming that your spending levels exceed
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.240]   your social security income or something,
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.480]   I might alter it.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.200]   But I think that three-fund strategy
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.200]   is very close to what I follow with my own kids.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.600]   To show you how much the line on active investing
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.120]   is drawn within my household,
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:04.320]   I invest actively the portfolio that my wife and I maintain.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.080]   For each of my kids, I've managed their money,
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.880]   but I increasingly have shifted their money to index funds.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.840]   And I have probably five funds rather than three.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.920]   So basically the U.S., I break it out into little more,
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.320]   'cause my problem with even with the total stock market fund
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.480]   is you end up probably overweighted in large cap companies.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:28.320]   So I want to get my own exposure across market cap classes.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.520]   I know there are people who take issue
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.200]   with the international fund,
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.840]   because we know in the last 20 years,
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.920]   those international funds,
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.240]   and you can look at your own portfolio,
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.160]   have underperformed the U.S.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.400]   And some people have concluded,
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.680]   therefore international investing doesn't make sense.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.440]   They're missing the long-term part of equities,
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.920]   which is, hey, you win for decades
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.240]   and then you lose for decades.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.440]   So I do invest my kids' money in international funds.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.040]   And when they come back and say,
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.560]   "Hey, dad, why do you invest our money
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.600]   "in this international fund?
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.000]   "It seems to have earned only 8% of U.S."
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.560]   I tell them, "Look, it's law of averaging.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.280]   "It's going to work out for you."
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.920]   So I think that's a good strategy.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.560]   Keep it simple, because you've got life to live.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.440]   I mean, that's one thing that bothers me
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.200]   about people who don't enjoy active investing,
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.440]   who still go out and try to pick stocks,
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.040]   taking the limited time they have.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.880]   They don't enjoy the process,
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.400]   but they feel that they have to do it,
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.160]   because if they don't do it, it's like admitting failure.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.120]   So I think it's actually a simple strategy,
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.640]   a good one, and one that won't get you into much trouble.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.600]   - So now I need to know your view
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.040]   of the critics of indexing.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.600]   And every year, it seems, a new critic
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.160]   comes out of the closet with a new study
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:42.160]   talking about how indexing is going to destroy the markets.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.400]   When people all decide to sell at once,
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.720]   it's going to cause havoc.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.880]   How do you feel about all of these studies?
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.760]   - Notice how the terrain has shifted.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.520]   They don't even try to make the case anymore
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.400]   that you as an investor would be better off
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.400]   with active investors investing your money.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.640]   They've given up on that, because you can't win that fight.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.320]   That fight's lost.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.560]   So now they have to point to macro concerns they have
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.560]   because of the push towards indexing.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.200]   And they do have a point.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.680]   It's really a question of whether you,
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.000]   as an individual investor, want to take care of the fact
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.920]   that the market might be becoming less efficient
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.680]   because of indexing, to which your response is,
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.520]   why do I care?
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.720]   I need to get my pension lined up.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:21.880]   So first, you've got to be clear
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.320]   that much of the macro concerns
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.080]   are not going to convince somebody
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.760]   to move away from indexing because they're macro concerns.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.720]   They're things about, and there are issues,
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.040]   I think, that we have to be clear about.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.320]   It is true that the shift towards passive investing,
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:40.160]   that has been massive in the last 15 years.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:45.040]   Active investors are in an existential crisis right now.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.120]   It's adding to the momentum issue,
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.840]   which is it makes momentum a stronger force
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.560]   in both directions.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.400]   Why?
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.400]   Because money flows to the biggest winners, right?
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.280]   Because it's based on market cap.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.720]   So it is going to make momentum stronger in both directions.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.480]   That's neither here nor there
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.080]   because momentum being stronger in both directions
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.240]   can benefit traders in the market.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.880]   It can also mean that if you're an old-time investor,
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.280]   even if you're right about value,
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.360]   you've got to wait a lot longer
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.560]   before the price corrects to value.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.040]   I've adjusted for that in my time horizon.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.400]   I am willing to wait longer now
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.960]   because that's one of the side products of passive investing.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.800]   So there are macro effects.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.320]   I'm not sure whether they're good or bad,
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.560]   but there are macro effects
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.600]   that have come from passive investing.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.640]   But it's not your job or my job to worry about those.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.280]   I'm not going to invest actively
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.600]   because this will make the market more efficient.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.600]   First, the link there is very weak.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.360]   How does my investing actively
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.080]   make the market more efficient?
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.720]   And second, I don't see the payoff
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.760]   to my making the market more efficient
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.800]   in my pension that I collect out of my fund.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.480]   So I think there are macro concerns.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.160]   But I think if there are macro concerns,
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.800]   it's going to come through regulation
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.160]   that's going to affect you.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.480]   And that is one of the things
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.560]   I would keep an eye out as a passive investor
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:09.200]   is you're going to see active investors go to the SEC
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.320]   and say you've got to rescue the market
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.360]   because passive investing is destroying it
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:18.560]   by adding layers or limitations to passive investing.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.400]   And I would fight that every step of the way.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.480]   But you can see it coming.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.720]   That's the case they're making.
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.240]   They're not making the case to you and I
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.680]   as individual investors.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.280]   They're making the case to regulators.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.160]   - I see that more and more.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.240]   Oh, these three big companies,
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.040]   Vanguard, BlackRock, and--
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.200]   - State Street.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.520]   - State Street have too much power.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.800]   They control boards.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.400]   They are running our lives.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.080]   And you begin to see more and more of these articles.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.360]   And it is concerning because politicians
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.320]   can hone in on that.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.440]   - And you know what, Larry Fink fed into that.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:53.760]   I think that was one of my pushbacks on the ESG is,
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.280]   come on, guys, you got to stop.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.640]   When you are the biggest passive investor
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.760]   in the world in BlackRock,
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.600]   and Larry Fink gets up there and says,
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.840]   "ESG is good for value."
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.720]   To begin with, that was false.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.560]   You are playing right into the hands of your critics.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.840]   So in a sense, Vanguard has been very good.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.320]   Notice how low key they are.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.760]   They try to stay below the radar,
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.880]   which is the way you need to be as a passive.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:19.040]   Don't make yourself a visible target.
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.280]   And I think that BlackRock learned from the ESG lesson,
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.680]   hopefully, and is going to crawl back into its space.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.600]   But I think that they brought some of that on themselves
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.880]   with the relentless pushing of virtue investing
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.040]   as part of indexing.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.840]   It should never be in there.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.640]   You have a job, you have a fiduciary responsibility.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.480]   Just do it.
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:45.120]   - Want to get into one more area, and that is AI.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:49.760]   So AI is going to change the world, we're told.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.000]   Maybe it already has.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   How is it going to affect us as investors?
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.720]   - For me, this became real about nine months ago
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.800]   when I was teaching my spring 2024 class.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.920]   It was the 10th week of a 15-week class.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.680]   I get a call from a friend of mine, Vasanth Dar,
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.280]   who teaches machine learning at NYU.
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.680]   So he calls and he says,
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.480]   "Aswath, we built a demoderant bot."
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.440]   I said, "A what?"
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.400]   He said, "A demoderant bot."
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.120]   He said, "It's an AI entity
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.080]   "that we've essentially fed every single post
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.280]   "you've ever written."
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   And I'm verbose.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.880]   I've written like 2,500 pages on my blog.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.720]   I've fed it every book you've written,
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.880]   every valuation you've done, every YouTube video.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.360]   And I'm a prime candidate
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.400]   because my entire life is out there online.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.400]   And the AI entity had not just read it,
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.600]   it assimilated, remembered everything.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.400]   I don't remember what I wrote 10 years ago,
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.320]   but my AI bot does.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.160]   And then he said, "Look, we want to run a test,
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:51.720]   "a test where you give us 25 students from your class
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.560]   "who each individually value companies,
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.720]   "and we'll get the demoderant bot to value the company
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.360]   "to see who wins."
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.160]   He's not come back with the results yet,
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.280]   but I'm terrified.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.880]   If he finds that the bot does better,
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.160]   then it's a signal to me that my days are numbered.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.920]   That a bot can effectively do what I do.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.760]   If he finds a bot doesn't do well,
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.960]   then everything I do is about teaching.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.640]   So all my teaching is to not,
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:17.120]   if somebody's read everything I've ever done,
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.760]   watched everything I've ever done,
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.880]   is not able to value a company.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.960]   But I wrote a post about that.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.040]   And I wrote it from a personal perspective.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.240]   I said, "I can see what the bot is.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.200]   "I can see what it can do.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.440]   "What can I do to stay ahead of my bot?"
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.280]   When I finished my valuation class,
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:38.960]   I said, "Each of you has a bot looking over your shoulder."
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.680]   And the question you've got to ask yourself is,
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.560]   "What can I do better than the bot?"
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.600]   Let's face it.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.360]   If what you do in your job is mechanical,
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.680]   a bot's going to be better at you.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.240]   A machine is always going to be better
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.360]   at mechanical stuff than you are.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.320]   If what you do in your job is primarily rule-based,
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.800]   accounting, software,
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:00.520]   one of the reasons coding is so easy to turn over to AI
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.760]   is it's rule-based, right?
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.400]   You follow the same rules.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.240]   A bot is going to be better.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.840]   If you're so biased that I can see where you're going
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.320]   before you even start,
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.720]   a bot will figure that out and do it for you,
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.080]   which means a lot of appraisals and valuations
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.560]   you see out there become pointless
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.480]   because you know where the end game is.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.840]   So I listed out these things that bots do
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.520]   that they can do as well as you.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.840]   And I said, "If your job is primarily mechanical,
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.280]   "rule-based, and bias-driven,
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:29.560]   "a bot's going to be able to beat you, do it better."
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.040]   And then I asked a different question.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:32.720]   What do we do as human beings
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.720]   that's going to be more difficult for bots to replicate?
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.280]   I talked about renaissance men,
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.920]   people who do a bunch of different things,
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.720]   maybe none of them really well.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.200]   Now, people who are in multiple disciplines.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.720]   We've become a world of specialists.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.480]   We're setting ourselves to be botified,
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:49.880]   be more of a generalist, you know?
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.640]   So if you want to learn about markets,
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.040]   not just equity markets, not just about bond markets,
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:54.880]   think about price.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.560]   So spread your interests widely.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.560]   The second is the stories and numbers.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.240]   If what you do in valuation is financial modeling,
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.920]   put numbers in an Excel spreadsheet,
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.160]   computer ratios, hey, I don't need you.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.920]   A bot can do that.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.600]   And the third is a little strange,
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:14.520]   but I talked about the importance of having an idle mind.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.240]   I get questions every week
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.880]   from people who read my blog or read my book,
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.720]   and they say, "Can you give me more reading suggestions?
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:22.880]   "What should I be reading?"
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.240]   And my response sometimes surprises them.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:28.120]   I said, "Read less, think more."
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.320]   Because we have so much stuff out there
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.720]   that we can fill every moment of every day
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.000]   that we're not thinking enough.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.720]   Now, we're not using our reasoning muscles.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.600]   Let's face it, we have a question.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.440]   I don't know about you,
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.560]   but what's the first thing we're all trying to do?
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.560]   We go on Google search.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:46.480]   So convenient, it's right there.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.280]   And we become so used to that
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.880]   that we no longer reason our way to an answer.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.520]   And a reasoning muscle, if you don't use it,
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.640]   will get flabby, and evolution will work its magic.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.400]   And who knows, a generation from now,
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.720]   two generations from now,
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.560]   human beings might be unable to reason.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.440]   But the other thing about having an idle mind,
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:07.920]   it's where these thoughts can connect.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:10.560]   Thoughts that look disconnected can connect.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.680]   I mean, think about Newton sitting under that apple tree,
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.560]   and apple falls on his head.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.680]   If he'd been looking at his iPhone,
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:18.800]   he'd probably have taken the apple,
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.040]   thrown it to the side,
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:22.400]   and he'd have gone back to his iPhone.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.360]   He had nothing to do,
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:25.880]   so he started thinking about why did the apple fall down
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:26.720]   rather than go up,
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.160]   and the theory of gravity came about.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.800]   We make these amazing connections.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.120]   Human beings can make these amazing connections
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.600]   that lead to insight.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:41.120]   But you have to let your brain have that open space.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.440]   And unfortunately, we live in a time
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:46.680]   where every moment of every day is filled up.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.320]   I mean, I remember 30 years ago,
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.800]   standing in a line at the bank.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.120]   You know, what you could do?
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.280]   Nothing.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.480]   So you were idle-minded.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.720]   Now you're standing in line.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.240]   Everybody's looking at their iPhones,
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.800]   checking out their emails.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.040]   We're not giving ourselves enough open space
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.200]   to think about things,
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.040]   to have those aha moments.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.680]   We have insight.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.960]   So I would encourage people to rediscover their humanity,
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.800]   because that's going to be your biggest weapon
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:16.160]   against the bortification that is coming down the pike.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.240]   - Well, it's been wonderful having you on,
