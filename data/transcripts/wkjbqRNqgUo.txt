[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.840]   - All right, next question we got.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.920]   Andrew, he's got some ideas about writing
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.040]   for a technical audience,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.160]   and he wants your thoughts on that.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.360]   So let's fire away with Andrew here.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.600]   - Hi, Cal, longtime listener, first time caller.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.400]   My name is Andrew, and I work as a virtual CFO
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.280]   who also builds data pipelines for my clients.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.540]   I found some interesting topics
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.080]   when combining those two worlds
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.960]   that I'd like to write more about.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.520]   I'm specifically writing more
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.040]   about timeless business management principles
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.080]   and combining those with the new data-rich world
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.220]   that we're in.
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.320]   I've written for more of a general audience in the past,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.720]   but I'm toying with the idea of writing
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.200]   for an academic or research journal type audience.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.160]   My background is in finance and accounting,
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.040]   which did not have a lot of writing in school,
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.640]   so I feel like this is a blind spot for me.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.400]   What advice do you have for a non-academic
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.000]   trying to write for this world,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.880]   and are there any resources you'd recommend checking out?
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.720]   Thanks, Cal.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.520]   - There definitely is a gap
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.240]   between general audience writing and academic writing.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.160]   Probably as much as anyone else in the world
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.240]   I know about this gap,
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.280]   as I'm someone who has done quite a bit of both.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.660]   General audience writing in some sense is harder, right,
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.660]   because you actually have to deploy more craft
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.560]   to do general audience writing well.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.680]   So the actual writing itself is harder to do,
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.920]   the clarity of the ideas, the structure of the writing,
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.100]   the examples you give, the narrative momentum
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.400]   that brings people from one idea to the other,
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.720]   the introducing a lay audience to complicated ideas
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.800]   without overwhelming them,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.520]   by giving them enough to latch onto
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.280]   so they can keep figuring out
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.560]   what you're trying to talk about.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.200]   That's all hard from a craft perspective.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.640]   When it comes to technical writing for, let's say, a journal,
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.600]   an academic journal, you have to be clear,
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.880]   but no one really cares about the craft.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.000]   You don't have to have a lot of narrative momentum
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.600]   in your journal article.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.280]   You don't have to have nice illustrative examples.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.620]   You don't have to worry about redundancies.
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.200]   You don't have to worry about the issue of,
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.960]   you know, I mentioned this thing earlier
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.760]   and it needs to pay off here,
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.200]   and I need the end to call back the beginning.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.560]   You don't need a turn or a nut necessarily
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.400]   in academic writing.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.680]   It's more workmanlike.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.200]   You wanna write clearly, you're conveying the information,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.320]   but the real craft in academic writing
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.200]   is generating that information in the first place.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.600]   Here's the theory, here's the experiment, here's the idea.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.320]   So it's two very different worlds.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.040]   Now, I will say as an aside,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.760]   I sometimes bring the craft that I have worked on
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.720]   in the world of general purpose writing
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.280]   to my academic papers.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.200]   I will sometimes, for example,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   as I'm known among my collaborators to do,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.600]   obsess over introductions, wordsmith them
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.360]   so it flows really well and there's a storyline.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.480]   Here's the thing, none of that really helps.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.920]   I mean, I think the readers appreciate it.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.500]   I have not seen a discernible impact
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.040]   on whether or not my papers get accepted or not
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.560]   into academic venues if I write at a,
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.720]   let's say a New Yorker style introduction
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.680]   to my academic paper.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.600]   So I do it because I can't help it,
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.920]   but it doesn't really matter.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.160]   If you're gonna do academic writing, don't wing it.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.800]   You have to understand for the venue
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.860]   that you're writing for, what is required
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.120]   for a paper to be accepted for publication?
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.280]   Who needs to be on that?
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.760]   Like, can you do this as a virtual CFO
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.700]   who specializes in building data pipelines
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.560]   for the journal you wanna write for?
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.520]   Can you just write for them from that perspective
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.080]   or do you need an academic co-author?
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.600]   So who needs to be on these paper?
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.060]   What is the level of original theory or ideas
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.960]   that needs to be in here?
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.800]   What sort of backing do you need?
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.560]   What type of literature reviewer understanding
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.400]   do you have to convey?
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.560]   This is a big piece of a lot of academic writing
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.320]   is showing a sophisticated understanding
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.560]   of the landscape of existing publications
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.360]   and showing that you understand
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.200]   where your work fits into the landscape.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.060]   It's one of the big sins in academic writing
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.080]   that if a reviewer senses you don't know our field well,
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.960]   they're not gonna publish your piece.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.260]   Don't guess at all this.
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.840]   You really need to know the right answers
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.960]   because your papers will not get accepted
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.560]   if you try to wing it.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.040]   There's very specific parameters
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.760]   for each different particular venue
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.800]   that you might try to publish in.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.280]   So that would mean at the easiest,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.400]   deconstruct existing papers in the venues
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.060]   you wanna publish.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.000]   Perhaps more effective, though slightly harder
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.320]   is to talk with people who are publishing
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.640]   in those venues already,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.360]   people who are writing similar articles.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.800]   Talk to them about their work
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.560]   and what's required for these things to get accepted.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.280]   Even more effective and even more difficult
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.760]   would be get a co-author who is experienced,
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.840]   convince someone who is already publishing
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.740]   multiple times in a venue,
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.300]   the co-author a paper with you,
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.880]   learn on the job what is required,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.760]   what do we need, what standard of evidence,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.480]   what review, what does it really take?
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.400]   But all this comes back to the same idea.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.100]   You need information.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.240]   You need hard, realistic, on-the-ground information
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.200]   about how this type of publishing works
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.640]   before you try to do it.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.080]   And I'm gonna attempt to generalize this
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.200]   for lots of different issues
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.640]   because I think this comes up a lot
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.780]   when people are thinking about new projects or endeavors.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.580]   It is very easy to come up with
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.080]   what you want to be the reality.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.360]   Here's what I'm gonna do,
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.000]   here's what I want it to be.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.360]   I want to be a novelist,
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.240]   and that means I'll do National Novel Writing Month
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.440]   with a proper Scrivener configuration,
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.720]   and that will make me a novelist.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.680]   We want the story to be what we want it to be,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.600]   but the reality might be,
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.080]   no, there's a lot more training involved.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.000]   There's a lot higher bar that you have to pass.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.280]   Here's how you can tell if you're at the right level.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.560]   And so in general, I like to push that advice.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.640]   When doing something new,
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.000]   first do the work of figuring out
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.320]   about what is actually required to succeed.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.680]   What is actually required to succeed?
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.020]   So there's a story I told in a podcast interview recently.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.640]   It has not come out yet.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.160]   I don't usually reveal interviews I've done
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.200]   until after they've come out,
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.400]   but I think Jesse knows who I'm talking about here.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.480]   I did a podcast interview recently
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.060]   with a relatively large podcaster.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.480]   You'll verify it was a pretty large podcaster.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.400]   - Yes, for sure.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.480]   I'm a fan of his podcast as well.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.840]   - All right, that's all we'll say for now.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.520]   And that's coming out in the new year at some point.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.400]   But one of the things we got into in that interview
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.080]   was how did I get started in nonfiction book writing?
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.360]   And I got into detail about the path I took
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.400]   because I was 20.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.080]   I was 20 years old when I got serious about writing books.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.960]   I signed my first book deal with Random House
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.000]   right after I turned 21.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.120]   So we're getting into it on this podcast interview.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.440]   How did I make that work?
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.280]   And what I did,
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.200]   I think this is the biggest differentiating factor
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   between me and the other sort of weird, nerdish 20-year-olds
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.360]   who might think about writing books,
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.040]   is I said, "I wanna get the real answer
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.480]   about what would be required for someone my age
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.000]   to get a book deal."
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.960]   And so I used a family friend who was in journalism
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   and said, "Can you connect me with a literary agent?
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.080]   And you can make it clear to this agent
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.960]   that I'm not gonna try to sell them something.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.160]   I'm not gonna get her to sign me.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.320]   I just want 30 minutes information."
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.440]   And so my memory is he hooked me up
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.680]   with a phone call with an agent.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.880]   She was a fiction agent, so this was good.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.640]   There was no chance I was gonna try to sell her.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.160]   She primarily focused on fiction,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.040]   but she was very well-established, knew the industry well.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.760]   I said, "Look, I'm a 20-year-old.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.760]   I wanna try to sign a book deal.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.760]   What would really be required?"
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.000]   And she gave me the reality.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.640]   And honestly, it's probably not what you'd wanna hear.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.800]   I think what I wanted to hear was like,
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.640]   "You're great, your idea is great.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.240]   Just start writing every day
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.200]   and your book will be published."
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.160]   And it's not what she told me.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.680]   She's like, "Look, there's gonna be a huge bar
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.720]   for you to cross as someone that young
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.560]   trying to get a book deal.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.400]   It's a risk.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.640]   So here's the things you're gonna have to do.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.680]   I think what you need to do first of all
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.840]   is get more publication credits.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.160]   You have to start writing articles
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.240]   that are on the topic you wanna sell the book on.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.600]   They're gonna wanna see writing samples in this genre
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.240]   to see that you really know how to write.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.200]   So you gotta sell it.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.280]   Also, you're gonna wanna do a lot of research in advance.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.840]   They're not gonna trust you to come up with the right idea.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.360]   So you need to do that all in advance.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.000]   I would do as much of the research for the book
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   as possible in advance
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.240]   that you can give the agent followed by the publisher
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.160]   a really detailed table of contents.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.320]   Here's what I'm thinking.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.840]   So I can write on this topic.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.040]   People have paid me to write on this topic.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.160]   I've done all the research.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.280]   Here's the content.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.160]   You can see exactly what's gonna be.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.400]   She said, "You're probably gonna have to do
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.160]   some pretty extensive sample chapter writing."
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.240]   So I took that all to heart and it took me a while.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.560]   I went out there and got commissions.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.360]   They were small publications.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.040]   My first books were aimed at college students.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.800]   So these were student-focused publications.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.960]   Some of these were online only.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   Some of these were paper magazines
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.320]   that they would distribute for free on college campuses.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.160]   There used to be a publication called Business Today.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.080]   I'm sure if that still exists.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.280]   Came out of Princeton University, students would run it.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.680]   But whatever, there's these publications.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.960]   They weren't high bar publications,
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.720]   but they were publications.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.240]   And I began pitching articles
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.160]   that were student advice oriented.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.760]   And as part of that effort,
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.080]   I did all of the research for my first book.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.280]   It was one article commission that required me to talk
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.080]   to a small number of Rhodes Scholars
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.520]   for the article commission.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.600]   And I took that commission and interviewed 25 people.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.720]   Way more than I needed for that article,
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.880]   but it was all the research I needed
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.120]   for the first book I was gonna pitch, How To Win A College.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.640]   So I did that work and it was a pain
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.720]   and it's not what I wanted the answer to be.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.480]   And it took me a year.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.040]   But then when I was done, I could get an agent like that
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.920]   and she could turn around and sell that book like that.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.000]   And we were off to the races.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.080]   If I had done what I wanted the right answer to be,
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.480]   which is just people will recognize your brilliance
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.160]   when you give them a one page summary of your idea
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.360]   and they'll just give you a lot of money.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.800]   I never would have started writing.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.440]   So this is my broader interpretation here.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.360]   If you wanna do something new, regardless of what it is,
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.640]   face the hard truth by talking to experts
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.560]   about what's really required.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.760]   It stinks in the moment
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.160]   because it's usually more than you wanna do.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.960]   But it is a huge competitive advantage in the longterm
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.040]   because it means you're actually gonna put your energy
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.160]   on the things that really matter
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.720]   while all of your potential competitors
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.000]   trying to get started in the same world
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.960]   will be doing National Novel Writing Month
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.720]   and optimizing their Scrivener configurations
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.680]   and they're never gonna get there.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.240]   All right, I think that works.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.000]   Jesse, would you be excited to read a book
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.280]   about virtual CFOs and rich data pipelines?
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.200]   - Possibly, that was a good answer though.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.800]   I mean, you gave Andrew a lot of content there.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.200]   Andrew's gonna be happy.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.040]   - I hope so, yeah.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.240]   It'd be funny if what Andrew was really wanting to write
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.640]   was like a thriller novel,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.000]   but about virtual CFOs who through the construction
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.920]   of a rich data pipeline,
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.720]   saves the world from a meteor strike
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.120]   and gets the girl in the end.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.440]   I'd be there for that book.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.480]   - And he also throws like a mean fastball
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.920]   'cause he plays baseball on the side.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.200]   - He plays baseball on the seat.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.560]   Richard, we're giving you the secret here.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.360]   That's the book you need to write.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.640]   Forget what everyone tells you, just start writing, man.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.040]   10 pages a day, follow the muse.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.440]   You're gonna be Dan Brown this time next year.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.000]   The baseball throwing virtual CFO
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.320]   who's rich data pipelining.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.440]   He's been using just to attract women
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.560]   but decides to put his skill to use
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.800]   and takes a break from his pitching responsibility
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.240]   slash data pipeline responsibilities
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.920]   to save the earth from a meteor.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.760]   I love it, man.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.920]   You're set.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
