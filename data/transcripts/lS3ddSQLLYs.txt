[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   [silence]
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.540]   Let's just think about addiction,
[00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.780]   because in biology and in psychology, frankly,
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.180]   it really often pays to think about the extremes first
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.060]   and then work our way towards more typical circumstances.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.100]   And with that said,
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.580]   addiction, unfortunately, is very common nowadays.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.060]   I just heard a statistic, in fact,
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.700]   that there is an 80, 80% increase
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.380]   in alcohol use disorder among women in the last 30 years.
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.540]   I talked a little bit about this
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.020]   in the episode that I did about alcohol and health.
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.940]   Again, I want to be very clear.
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.540]   I'm not somebody that is completely against alcohol
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.200]   for adults, provided they're not alcoholics.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.520]   Turns out two drinks a week, probably fine health-wise.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.120]   Zero would be better, if we're honest.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.340]   Zero is better than any alcohol.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.180]   But two drinks a week is probably fine.
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.580]   Past two drinks, you start running into problems.
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.100]   And yet many, many people out there, male and female alike,
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.780]   suffer from alcohol use disorder, also called alcoholism.
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.920]   The same is also true for things like methamphetamine
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.020]   or cocaine or other types of substance addictions.
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.300]   And the same is also true for a lot of behavioral
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.520]   or what are sometimes called process addictions,
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.340]   things like sex addiction or video game addiction
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.140]   or any type of behavior that, frankly,
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.780]   is leveraging the dopamine system,
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.780]   but that engages this progressive narrowing
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.780]   of the things that bring someone pleasure,
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.220]   such that nothing else is really salient.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.500]   Nothing else is really pulling them in
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.360]   in the way that their video games or sex
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.300]   or pornography or alcohol, pick your substance
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.760]   or behavior that you see out there, or hopefully not,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.260]   but that you might suffer from an addiction to.
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.340]   So what's happening in addiction?
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.720]   Well, addiction involves dopamine, among other things,
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.380]   often, the opioid system, et cetera.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.440]   But if we were to think about what's the stimulus
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.460]   in an addiction and what's the peak in dopamine,
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.420]   and then what happens after that peak,
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.940]   it all becomes very clear as to why addiction happens
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.260]   and why it's so pernicious.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.160]   So for instance, let's take cocaine.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.820]   Cocaine causes dramatic increases in dopamine
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.340]   very, very fast.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.380]   So if somebody craves cocaine, what are they craving?
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.900]   They're craving that dopamine peak.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.300]   They're craving the increased level of alertness.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.060]   They're craving a number of things associated
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.660]   with the feeling of being under the influence of the drug,
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.700]   but the stimulus for it simply becomes that line of cocaine,
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.780]   or in the case of crack,
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.580]   that crack rock that they're going to smoke,
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.100]   and God forbid, they're mainlining it.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.100]   You know, they're shooting into a vein.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.100]   What happens is they snort, smoke, or inject cocaine,
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.220]   and dopamine levels almost immediately
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.340]   go up, up, up, up, up, up to a very high peak, okay?
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.220]   So the time gap between the stimulus and the dopamine
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.820]   is very, very short, so short, in fact,
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.160]   that there's really no other contingencies in between
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.620]   that the mesocortical system has to learn.
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.740]   In fact, what does the system quote-unquote learn?
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.740]   It learns cocaine equals massive amounts of dopamine
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.980]   equals feeling euphoric and energetic, et cetera,
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.500]   and in doing that, it reinforces the whole circuit
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   so that that short, we can even say hyper short contingency,
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.180]   is really what the system wants,
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.400]   so much so that longer contingencies of, say,
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.220]   putting in the hard work of, you know,
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.700]   generating a fitness program
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.660]   or a professional program for yourself
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.820]   or a education program, which takes not just many days,
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.260]   but many weeks and years,
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.820]   well, none of that is going to lead to peaks in dopamine
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.260]   that are as high as the peak in dopamine
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.980]   associated with cocaine.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.340]   So that tells us something critical.
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.340]   It is both the duration between desire and effect,
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.900]   and when I say effect, I mean the rewarding properties
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.220]   of dopamine that are experienced, that's important,
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.140]   so very short gaps teach the system
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.540]   to expect and want short gaps,
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.900]   makes it very hard to pursue things that take longer.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.580]   So when we say it's the short,
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.380]   or in this case, hyper short distance
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.220]   or time between the stimulus and the dopamine,
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.440]   what we're really talking about,
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.780]   if we were to plot this out on a board
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.860]   or on a piece of paper,
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.500]   is the steepness of the rise of that peak.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.940]   It's very, very steep.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.680]   The peak in dopamine is coming up very fast
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.820]   after the desire.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.040]   And in addition to that, and this is very important,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.900]   the higher the peak in dopamine
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.060]   and the faster the rise to that peak,
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.520]   the further below baseline the dopamine drops
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.840]   after the drug wears off.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.140]   Okay, so in the case of cocaine,
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.720]   it's a very fast and very large rise in dopamine
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.120]   followed by a steep drop
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.760]   and very deep trough in dopamine below baseline.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.440]   You say, okay, so there's pleasure,
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.240]   then there's lack of pleasure.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.640]   Ah, but it's worse than that
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.020]   because it's not just lack of pleasure.
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.360]   If you recall what we talked about a little bit earlier,
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.620]   that drop below baseline triggers the desire
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.560]   and the pursuit for what?
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.000]   For more.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.260]   And so this sets in motion a vicious loop
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.940]   where people start pursuing peaks in dopamine
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.760]   that can come very fast without much effort.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.340]   And that's one of the ways
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.380]   in which addictions start to take hold.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.440]   Now, there's a simple way to think about this
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.240]   and to remember if you want to avoid this whole thing.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.720]   I mean, the first one is obvious.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.640]   Don't do cocaine, don't try it, don't use it.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.920]   Certainly don't get addicted to it.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.320]   Those are all sort of one in the same, frankly.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.480]   I don't know many people that,
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.040]   despite opinions to the contrary,
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.220]   that use cocaine recreationally,
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.760]   that don't at some point run into either a financial,
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.480]   psychological, physical, or some other problem.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.840]   The other thing that's absolutely critical to keep in mind,
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.900]   and this was discussed in my colleague,
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.560]   Dr. Anna Lemke's book, "Dopamine Nation,"
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.640]   and on this podcast.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.600]   Excellent book, by the way.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.680]   I highly recommend it if you haven't read it already.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.860]   It's a fascinating exploration into dopamine
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.040]   as it relates to addiction,
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.760]   not just drug addiction, but other types of addiction.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.440]   Again, the name of that book is "Dopamine Nation."
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.000]   We'll provide a link to it in the show note captions.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.460]   The other thing that happens
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.120]   after those big, fast increases in dopamine
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.920]   caused by things like cocaine
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.140]   is afterwards, when it quickly drops below baseline,
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.240]   it takes a much longer time
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.960]   to get back to the original baseline
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.680]   than it did prior to using the drug.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.920]   And worse still is that the peaks in dopamine
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.760]   that are created from more consumption of cocaine
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.600]   leads to progressively lower peaks
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.420]   and deeper troughs below baseline.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.800]   So the whole system is shifting away from pleasure
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.900]   and more to pain and the desire for pursuit of the drug.
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.240]   (upbeat music)
