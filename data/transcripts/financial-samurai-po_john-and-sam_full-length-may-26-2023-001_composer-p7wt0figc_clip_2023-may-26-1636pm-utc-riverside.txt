[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   - Hello everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.600]   And in this episode I have a special guest with me, Dr. John Durante, the principal of
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.160]   Syosset High School.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.580]   He recently launched a podcast called the College Admissions Process Podcast, the CAP.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.720]   And it's there, its goal is to provide insights straight from college admission professionals
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.040]   of top national universities and colleges.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.040]   So welcome, John.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.440]   - Sam, thank you so much for having me.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.160]   I've been waiting for this conversation.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.320]   I really appreciate it more than you'll ever know.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.680]   - Ha ha, no, no, I really appreciate you taking out your time.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.440]   So today there's no school today during Memorial Weekend Friday?
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.880]   - That's right, no school today.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.320]   So I have all day, Sam.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.080]   Go ahead, you shoot with the questions.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.280]   - Well, tell me, John, you know, so I discovered your podcast because I've been listening to
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.840]   a lot more podcasts since the pandemic, which actually is kind of a contra because most
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.480]   people, many more people started working from home and they started not listening to as
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.480]   many podcasts.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.640]   But me, on the other hand, I started listening to more and I really enjoyed all your interview
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.280]   questions with various admissions officers.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.360]   I have two young children, six and three, and I'm thinking ahead about how to pay for
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.640]   college, how to strategically get into college, and whether it matters most.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.640]   So I really appreciate all the 120 plus interviews you've done so far.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.640]   - Well, I appreciate that, Sam.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.400]   And like you, I too became a fan of podcasts throughout the pandemic.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.040]   Obviously, we had a lot more time on our hands.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.760]   So I was introduced to it and I love the on-demand nature of it.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.240]   Whether you're taking a walk, exercising, commuting to work, you could listen anywhere,
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.320]   basically any time.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.000]   So that's what I loved about it.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.840]   And I realized that I wanted to actually do a podcast of my own.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.640]   When I was much, much younger, I used to DJ.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.400]   And so this is something that, you know, it's in my blood, I think.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.960]   But I wanted to do a podcast that, you know, frankly was going to work and not fail.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.440]   Because 80% of the people, unfortunately, that start a podcast, they actually fail quite
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.720]   quickly because it's a lot of work with editing, especially if you're a one-man person like
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.000]   I am.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.240]   But the way it came about was that I went through the college admissions process with
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.920]   both of my daughters.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.000]   One of them, who is just finishing her sophomore year up in Connecticut, she had an IEP while
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   in high school.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.040]   So high school was-- - And maybe explain IEP to the listeners.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.720]   - Yeah, so she had an IEP while in high school, which means she had an individual education
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.720]   plan.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.160]   So basically she was classified as a special education student, but she got her diploma,
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.320]   she took all the state exams that she needed to take, and she's thriving and doing fine
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.320]   today.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.560]   However, at the time, it was very stressful because she wasn't your typical student.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.760]   So I had to become that parent that really needed to help her, to talk to admissions
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.900]   representatives, and frankly, ask the question, should she even apply to your school?
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.060]   And what I found was a few things.
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.620]   First of all, the admissions representatives are phenomenal.
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.500]   They are so accessible, they really wanna help, they're happy to respond to your emails.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.260]   In my case, every once in a while, we even got on a phone call.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.880]   Obviously, I would go to the college fairs like many people do.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.820]   But I also recognize that other parents, many of them feel, I guess, a stigma.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.140]   Maybe they don't wanna reach out to the rep because they think somehow it's gonna be a
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.940]   bad mark on their child's application.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.660]   And others perhaps don't really know what questions to ask.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.380]   So since I had just gone through this, I came up with the idea, I said, if the admissions
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.800]   reps would sit down with me for a half hour, 45 minutes, whatever it is, and they would
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.820]   talk about their schools and all the great programs that they have to offer both in their
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.340]   classrooms and beyond, talk about giving insight into their overall application process, whether
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.140]   it's the essay, the test optional movement, and so many other things, and ultimately,
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.120]   asking the question, what are your top three pieces of advice that you would give students
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.100]   and their parents getting ready for the college admissions process?
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.020]   And so I reached out to a couple of reps thinking, let me see if this idea could be a reality.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.100]   And immediately, I had a lot of people saying yes.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.180]   And that's when I panicked, Sam, because at that point in time, I didn't know how do you
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.040]   record, how do you edit.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.860]   And so now with 123 episodes live as of today, I've certainly become, I don't wanna say a
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.020]   professional, but I'm getting better.
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.900]   - Well, that's great.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.580]   And this is on top of your day job as a principal, high school principal.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.580]   - That's correct, yes.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.300]   I'm the high school principal, as you mentioned, at Syosset High School.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.460]   I've been there for 29 years, only 13 years as the principal, and it's a phenomenal school,
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.460]   a highly academic place, the community is so supportive, and I've spent my entire career
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.260]   there and I absolutely love it.
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.360]   But again, this came about after helping my own daughters.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.820]   She helped me to see the need that parents have.
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.220]   A lot of people are just afraid to even reach out to the reps.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.900]   And so the podcast was born, and I'm having so much fun with it.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.460]   - No, that's great.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.540]   Your episodes are great.
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.620]   I listened to, most recently, the William & Mary episode because I went to the College
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.620]   of William & Mary.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.620]   - Fantastic.
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.300]   - And I also listened to the University of San Francisco episode because I'm based here
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.300]   in San Francisco.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.940]   And I really like that admissions fella.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.420]   He had a lot of enthusiasm and insights.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.380]   So as a principal, I'm curious to know how often are you approached by students and parents
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.680]   to get a college recommendation letter, and how much waiting does that have?
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.940]   Because to me, it sounds like, "Oh, if I got a recommendation letter from the principal,
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.180]   that must be pretty impressive."
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.500]   - Yes, I probably write about 20 a year.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.220]   So I would say I get approached pretty regularly.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.620]   And I think that, first of all, I always love to help people, which is why I came up with
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.940]   this crazy idea of doing this podcast, and here we are.
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.900]   But I think what's more important about recommendation letters or understanding the overall application
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.980]   is that you really have to look at it as a marketing package and understand that there
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.020]   are multiple parts, and the admissions reps will tell you that they take a holistic approach.
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.500]   So your transcript, that gives a picture of four years of your academic ramps, the challenges,
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.380]   and how you built those ramps.
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.820]   The activity sheet, obviously, that's what you've done outside of the classroom.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.780]   Your essay is your voice about yourself.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.340]   A recommendation letter is someone else's voice about you.
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.660]   So it's very important to understand the role of each of the parts while building upon each
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.620]   other and not repeating where the information is found somewhere else.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.220]   So I'll give you an example.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.020]   If I am a soccer player, and on my activity sheet I talk about playing on the varsity
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.180]   team and maybe I play on an academy team, and perhaps I help students after school with
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.340]   homework that are younger than me that play soccer in my club, that's fantastic.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.440]   Those are all great things.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:03.140]   If my essay is also about playing soccer, Sam, it's a missed opportunity, right?
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.800]   Because the activity sheet clearly defines all of those things that you do after school.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.660]   So unless the essay, yes, could be related to soccer, but it gives more insight in terms
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.900]   of something that occurred, your thought process, your reflections, how it made you better,
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.580]   how you see yourself with those qualities contributing on a college campus, unless the
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.700]   essay is giving that off, it's a missed opportunity.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.560]   So you asked a question about when students come to me for me to ask them, for me to write
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.780]   a letter of recommendation for them.
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:42.260]   I'm very mindful of not repeating what's already on their activity sheet or on their transcript.
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.180]   The college admissions representatives know whether you're an A, a B+, an A+ student based
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.500]   on your transcript.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.640]   They already know if you're a part of five after school activities.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:59.140]   I don't need to reiterate that in my recommendation letter, otherwise it's a missed opportunity.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.940]   So I'm going to give you an example of my favorite recommendation letter for a student.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.340]   I was in my office really early, Sam.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.740]   In my building, period one begins at 7.30.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.740]   Wow.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.740]   7.30?
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.300]   Yeah, it's really early.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.980]   So I was in the office before 7 one morning, checking email, and a student walks into my
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.860]   office and says, "Hey, I found this and I want to make sure it gets back to the rightful
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.860]   owner."
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.740]   I turn around and he puts a $100 bill on my desk.
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.300]   True story.
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.620]   We ultimately got it back to the rightful owner, but the point being is that what I
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.980]   said to that kid, and at the time he was in 10th grade, I said, "When you're ready for
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.740]   college, I'm going to write a letter for you."
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.620]   And my letter was the entire story.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.980]   And I think that talking about an incident like that, it's not so simple to find that
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.820]   story on a transcript, on an activity sheet, but his principal was able to talk about his
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:01.260]   integrity and how he found the $100 bill and never even thought once to take it, but rather
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.780]   he wanted to get it back to the rightful owner.
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.280]   So think about the admissions representative side.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.980]   That letter is my voice explaining all the great characteristics of that student.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.580]   So that letter builds on all of the other parts.
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.580]   Right, right.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.500]   No, that's a great story.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.900]   It's about character.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.100]   A lot of it is about character.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.220]   I've listened to more than a couple dozen episodes of yours and the admissions officers
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.660]   continuously kind of highlight about your essay.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.860]   It doesn't have to be about how glorious you are.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.700]   It can be about the day-to-day things, the simple things, your ride on the bus, what
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.380]   you eat, discussions with your family.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:48.260]   Because they must be screening over and over again highly qualified, highly tailored, customized
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.260]   applications.
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:55.220]   So I would think that something unique that does stand out does matter.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.220]   It does.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:02.020]   And they'll tell you that the most common essays are sports injuries or a story perhaps
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.020]   of a, or a story about a grandparent, for example.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.380]   So in the case of a grandparent, many mistakes that students make is they speak about their
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.660]   grandparent, many, for example, perhaps a grandparent came here from another country
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.860]   to find a better life for their family, which is a great story.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:25.540]   But the reps will say, "I want to admit grandpa, but I know nothing new about the student."
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.340]   So it's very important to write the letter.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.740]   It's very important to write the essay, put the pen down, put the computer down, go back
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.940]   to it a day later, a week later, a month later.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.440]   And here's the point of the essay.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:46.740]   When someone reads your essay, did they learn something new about you, who you are, the
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.700]   way you reflect, your thought process?
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.460]   And frankly, another thing that the colleges are trying to determine is how are you going
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.220]   to contribute to their school community?
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.500]   So those, in general, that's what you're trying to get out of the essay, again, as opposed
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:08.060]   to repeating that you're an A+ student or that you've played soccer your entire life.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.800]   Each piece of this holistic process, right, that's what they say, they review the application
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   holistically, each piece has to build upon the next.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.760]   So it's very important to understand what each piece means.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.720]   Now, another thing, Sam, if I may, many colleges, they'll ask students for a supplemental essay.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.960]   And what happens is students, many of them, they spend so much time on their general essay
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:35.200]   that when they see a school ask for one or two supplemental essays, they almost get frustrated,
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   right?
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.880]   They just want to rush through it and get it done.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.220]   Big mistake.
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.260]   Big mistake.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:46.460]   The point of the supplemental essay is for you to demonstrate your understanding of the
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.420]   institution.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.460]   Why do you want to go there?
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.140]   Why do you see yourself there?
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.660]   How do you see yourself contributing to their school community?
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.740]   A typical supplemental question would be, for example, why NYU?
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.220]   In other words, why would you want to go to NYU, New York University?
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.580]   And so some students see that as a simple question, but it has a deeper meaning.
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:15.500]   They're testing your demonstrated understanding of their institution and what you're going
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.940]   to do to make it better and contribute.
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.940]   Right.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:24.540]   You know, it just seems like getting good grades and standardized test scores for colleges
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.580]   who accept those scores is standard nowadays.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.300]   And I think you're absolutely right.
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.380]   Getting a unique essay that has a different perspective is very valuable.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.900]   So don't shirk on the responsibility of writing and spending time on those essays.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:46.500]   In terms of standardized admissions, I love your consistent questions about what percentage
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.100]   of the admitted students took standardized test scores.
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:55.060]   And it seems to me strategically that if you have a high standardized test score, you submit
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.060]   it.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.900]   If you don't, or it's not, you know, maybe it's 50 percent or it's below the 50 percent
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.820]   range, you don't submit it.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:08.420]   What are your thoughts in general about the trend towards no standardized test scores?
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.220]   And what are some good strategies that parents and students should think about?
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.220]   Sure.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.220]   And that's a great question.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.220]   Thank you so much, Sam.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:21.340]   So first of all, I absolutely think that every student should prepare for the SAT, ACT.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.980]   Frankly, take both of them and see if you do better on one or the other.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:30.700]   With my own daughters, both of them, for whatever reason, did better on the ACT.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.580]   And so that's what we followed.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.300]   So the reason why I ask that question, and thank you for posing it, it's basically, can
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.300]   you tell us the percentage of students that applied and who were ultimately admitted,
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.860]   not only who applied, but who were admitted that did not submit their test scores?
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.860]   And so I ask that question because a lot of people think that the test optional movement
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.100]   is a myth.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.140]   So clearly, if you listen to the episodes, in most cases, in most cases, it's about a
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.340]   50/50 split.
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:06.620]   Schools that are more competitive, maybe it's 60/40, 70/30, but clearly the test optional
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.840]   movement, if the school says that they are test optional, they are test optional.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.380]   Another thing to be very mindful of is that many times when you're researching a school,
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.020]   everyone looks at that mid 50%.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.660]   And it's very important to understand that obviously right now, in this era of test optional,
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:28.140]   of the test optional movement, only students that score high are submitting.
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.540]   Therefore, the mid 50% in terms of standardized test is skewed.
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.780]   It's much higher than it was before.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.660]   Don't be discouraged by that, students.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.060]   Don't be discouraged.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.520]   Know that it's going to be higher for that reason.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.420]   Only students that score well are submitting.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.900]   And take the test.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.940]   If you fall within that middle 50 and you feel it's a great indication of who you are
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.180]   academically, submit it.
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.700]   If a school says that they're test optional and they're reporting in my episodes that
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.340]   it's 50/50 in terms of how many submit or not, trust it.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.340]   Trust it.
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.660]   You want that marketing package, your overall application to be the best that it could be.
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:10.260]   If your score falls so much lower, but your transcript shows the rigor, the ramps that
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.020]   you built over four years, don't submit.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:17.580]   But if that score falls within the 50%, certainly submit that test score.
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.340]   And there are schools, for example, the UC system, Sam, right where you live, they're
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.340]   test blind.
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.460]   So whether you submit the scores or not, they're not looking at it.
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.380]   And where I think the trend is going to go moving forward, many of the admissions reps,
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.620]   they're reporting that they're looking at trends over the next couple of years.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.460]   And they're trying to determine going test optional, if they're seeing any changes in
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.220]   terms of the courses that students are taking, if they're seeing any changes in graduation
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.300]   rates.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:49.060]   And what most are saying is that if they don't see significant changes, the test optional
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.420]   movement is probably here to stay.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.420]   - Okay.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.540]   No, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.260]   What would you say to the people who are skeptic regarding the test optional movement so that
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:06.820]   colleges can do more to subjectively instead of objectively admit students based on what
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:13.380]   they think is the ideal class, what the ideal class looks like?
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.100]   - Yeah, so that's something really difficult to dig deep into.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:22.380]   I can tell you that all institutions have their institutional needs.
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:28.860]   So for example, it was reported that one particular school, they could only accept up to 18% of
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.180]   the students that are out of state.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.480]   Another school might be looking for more students within a certain major.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.340]   Another school might only accept a certain amount of students from a particular high
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.340]   school.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:47.780]   There are so many institutional needs governed by their board of trustees many times that,
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:54.460]   you know, I think the best advice that I could give is to control what you could control
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.780]   and don't worry about the rest.
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.560]   And what I mean by that is that there's a reason why you might hear of a student that
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:05.940]   gets accepted to Stanford and gets rejected to, I don't know, Yale, right?
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.980]   Both phenomenal schools, and I'm not trying to compare one with the other, both highly
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.660]   selective, highly academic.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:19.540]   But the reason may be if you have a straight A+ average and you've been part of many activities
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.640]   and you've taken on leadership roles and you've done so many humanitarian things, you've done
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.680]   all you can.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.320]   You wrote an outstanding essay.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.480]   Your supplemental essays were, to the point earlier, really demonstrating your understanding
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.080]   of the institution.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.660]   You have to understand that that's the best that you could do.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.320]   You created a marketing package that really represents who you are as a student, both
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.260]   inside of the classroom and out.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.500]   But it's also important to recognize that, yes, many times there's no rhyme or reason
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.260]   as to why students get accepted or not.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.780]   Let me put it in simple terms.
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.020]   Many schools, for example, they might have 1,000 seats.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.840]   They're looking to accept 1,000 students as a freshman class.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.160]   But they get 15,000 applications, 10,000 of which are all viable candidates.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.780]   So how do they choose?
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.100]   And so that's why there are so many things that come into play that, frankly, are out
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.540]   of our control.
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.280]   So I just think that part of the process is being mindful of all of this.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.660]   And of course, what makes it worse now is that if you're mindful of it, you're going
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:24.260]   to apply to more schools, which means that schools are getting even more applications.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.480]   And so it's a vicious cycle.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:32.380]   But my point in the whole podcast is to just shed light on all of this and really give
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.140]   people a resource that they could chew on and digest.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:42.660]   You know, as a parent, I have hopes and dreams for my children, as do you.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.500]   I think all parents do.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.780]   And then we wonder about the future.
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.060]   And I think one of the stepping stones for many families is for their children to go
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.340]   to college.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:59.340]   However, it seems that most of the information we can learn online is free or low cost now.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:05.880]   The European model has apprenticeships, which gets the apprentices into decent paying jobs
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.020]   and it goes up.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:12.120]   What is your thought about the overall future of college, given tuition rates have gone
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.920]   up way faster than the rate of inflation for so long?
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.580]   And there seems to be a huge disconnect.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:22.080]   I just recently saw the University of Southern California has a total all-in cost of about
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.960]   ninety one thousand for the coming year.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.900]   And that times four is a lot of money.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.960]   And it doesn't seem like it's going to stop or abate.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:38.220]   So what are your thoughts about the disconnect between the cost of college and the median
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.080]   income post-college?
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.820]   It doesn't seem like it's keeping up.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.760]   It's definitely not keeping up and it's certainly a major problem.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.320]   And obviously it's a conversation family to family.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.880]   There are many families, I myself went to a state university growing up.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:20:00.680]   And so it's a very important point to talk about the financial situation early and often
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.460]   with your student.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:08.360]   Many times the reps talk about the fact that a kid is really excited about a certain school.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.900]   He or she gets admitted only to find out that the parents can't afford it because they didn't
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.920]   get the financial aid package that they had hoped for.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.960]   These are conversations that have to start early.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.560]   If you're a family, like my family was, where we could only afford a state school growing
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:28.200]   up, then make that very clear early.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.000]   Another thing to understand is that every school has something called a net price calculator.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.760]   They're supposed to make it available to you on their websites.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:43.440]   And if you use the net price calculator, it's really a good indicator in terms of based
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:49.640]   on your salary, based on your financial situation, what it is that you're going to be able to
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.000]   afford or not at each and every school.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.640]   So my recommendation would be for people to use the net price calculator.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.640]   Sure.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.440]   Yeah, you know, it's interesting because I take a lot of views from a personal finance
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.240]   angle given financialsamurai.com.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.320]   And one of the things I didn't realize until listening to many of your episodes and other
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:17.160]   podcast episodes is that, you know, I used to think, "Ah, if you make a lot of money,
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.600]   you're going to get penalized and you're not going to get a lot of financial aid."
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.840]   So that's fine in the sense that, well, you make a lot of money so you can afford, more
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.080]   easily afford to pay for college.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:33.600]   But on the positive side is that actually if you make a lot of money, maybe, true or
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.000]   false, the admissions officers might say, "Oh, okay, well, you make a lot of money.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.880]   You can pay the full freight and you can also maybe be a bigger donor in the future."
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.560]   So what are your thoughts on that situation?
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:55.120]   So those are not typical questions that I ask in the episode because the goal with my
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:00.160]   podcast is, again, to have them give insight in terms of the programs that they offer inside
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.760]   of the classroom and beyond, to give insight into the review process, to give insight of
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:11.320]   life on campus, and then, of course, the advice that they could give students and parents.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.840]   In terms of the financial side, the net price calculator is huge.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:20.080]   The other thing that's huge is to apply early, usually it's within the early action stages
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:25.320]   because that's when they have the money that they consider for merit scholarships and things
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.640]   like that.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.640]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.320]   You know, it's a vicious cycle.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.840]   You made reference to $91,000 a year times four.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.440]   That's a lot of money.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.680]   Most people in the United States and beyond cannot afford that.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.080]   So something's got to give.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.760]   And again, I highlight the fact that it's very important, very important to talk about
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:53.900]   the financial ability of a family to afford a school or not, to have those conversations
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:54.900]   really early.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.900]   Right.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:01.580]   Yeah, my fear is for students and parents to apply to a school.
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.580]   They love the school.
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.540]   They get in, but they have to pay a lot more than they expect.
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:10.180]   And then they're saddled with a lot of student loan debt, and they don't get that job that
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.140]   they thought they were going to get.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.140]   It's interesting.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.020]   I was looking at some statistics at Harvard.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:23.100]   And to apply to these elite universities, you talk about a lot of nonprofit work, helping
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.500]   society, volunteering and all that.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.060]   You look like a great humanitarian on these college applications.
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:38.300]   But then I looked at the percentage of graduates who went to tech, finance and consulting,
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.300]   and it was almost 60%.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.340]   60% of graduates from Harvard went to these fields.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.980]   And I wondered, well, what happened to saving the world?
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.860]   What happened to humanity?
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.740]   Do you have any thoughts on why this is?
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:57.220]   Well, I do think that there's -- let me just take a second.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.220]   I'm sorry, Sam.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:09.780]   I'm going to take a sip of water.
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.860]   So I think there's a reality that students do a lot of humanitarian efforts, a lot of
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:20.660]   volunteer work to make sure that their activity sheet is full of diverse activities.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:27.180]   And whether or not they continue with it later on, maybe throughout college, they mature,
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:34.900]   if you will, and their -- they mature, if you will, and their interests change.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.900]   But I don't know.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.060]   That's something that's individual and not something that I necessarily dig deep in in
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.500]   my podcast.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.220]   That's not the focus of my podcast.
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.720]   My focus is to make sure that I get every single rep from every single college and university
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.300]   throughout the country.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.500]   So I'm not an investigative reporter where I'm trying to pin somebody in a corner, you
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.780]   know.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.420]   But we do have a lot of honest conversations.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.420]   And yes, you know, there are institutional needs.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.420]   And it's a problem.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:07.580]   And we talk about the fact that if you could take the first 20% of students that are denied
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.460]   admissions and you compare their profiles to the students that were accepted, many will
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.400]   tell you that there's no difference.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.100]   There's really no difference.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:21.240]   But if all of a sudden you have a donor that gives millions of dollars towards a health
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:26.640]   facility on campus and that person tells the board of trustees, by the way, this is something
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.820]   that was in Rick Clark's book, The Truth About College Admissions is what it's called.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:39.840]   If there's a donor and they build a health building on campus and the donor says, I want
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.580]   to see more, for example, and this is just an example, I want to see more females in
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:51.140]   the STEM fields, then that institution will hire more females in those majors.
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.340]   And there's multiple examples of that as well.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.140]   So that's definitely a reality.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.020]   Rick Clark was on one of my episodes.
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.020]   He's phenomenal.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.100]   He's at Georgia Tech.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:04.140]   But when he was on, we spoke about his book, The Truth About College Admission, which I
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.340]   would recommend because he's excellent.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.140]   And if you're going to listen to the podcast, I would listen to that episode because that
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:15.820]   was one episode where we dig really deep into exactly that, the different institutional
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:20.700]   needs and Rick gave tremendous examples that I think would be helpful in terms of his insight
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.140]   to your listeners, Sam.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.780]   Sounds good.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:31.060]   On the podcast, you speak about the importance of visiting campus and just to get a feel,
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:37.420]   I guess how long should you stay to visit campus and what if you can't afford to visit
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.060]   campus or you can't get to it because of scheduling conflicts?
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.900]   And what are some questions that students should be asking while they're on campus and
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.980]   what should they be doing to really get that full immersive experience so they don't have
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.900]   any kind of head fakes or surprises once they matriculate?
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.660]   Well, those are great questions and I'll try to break it down different ways.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:04.340]   So first off, many students are not able to visit campus because of financial constraints.
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.700]   There are many students that may be able to afford it but then there are time constraints.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.700]   So it's not easy to visit campuses, especially if you're on the East Coast and you're thinking
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.020]   about going to school on the West Coast.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:20.700]   So what I would recommend first is wherever you live in the United States or beyond, there's
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.460]   got to be a college campus near you.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:28.740]   So whether or not you intend to go to the schools that are within an hour from wherever
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.020]   you live, go and pay them a visit.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.020]   You get a feel of the campus.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.380]   Do you want to have a campus that is in a city?
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.540]   Do you want a campus that has an actual campus?
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.380]   Do you want to be in a big school, a small school?
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:48.100]   Do you want to be more than an hour away from your house or do you want to be closer?
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.700]   These are all things that you should consider and so if you can't afford getting on a plane
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:57.580]   and traveling across the country, at least go visit local campuses to get a feel of what
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.180]   it is that you're looking for in a college, large school, small school, medium school,
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.540]   and all of that.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:08.380]   The next thing is that the pandemic has taught us that there's a lot that we could do virtually.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.380]   So engage in the virtual events.
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:16.620]   If you're able to visit campus, certainly do the tour, certainly ask questions of the
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:22.500]   student, but take the time to speak to random students on campus.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.580]   How accessible are the professors?
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.860]   Is this a commuter school?
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.300]   What do students do on the weekend?
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.780]   Do they go home or is there a lot going on?
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.860]   If you're interested in the social life, yes.
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:37.020]   If you're interested in the party life, ask the random student.
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:42.780]   The other advice that I would give to students is to be aware of the full sense of comfort
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.060]   when you're on a college campus, for example, with your brother or sister or your parents
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.580]   or whoever it is that's familiar to you, that's visiting with you.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.020]   It's very easy to go to a campus, you go on the tour, they show you all the beautiful
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:59.300]   things, you usually go and have a nice lunch or a dinner with your family nearby and you
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.020]   feel comfortable.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:06.500]   And be weary of that false sense of comfort because you're there with your parent.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:12.060]   So my advice to parents here is when you visit, if you're able to, give your child, even if
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:17.420]   it's a half hour on their own, let them go sit on a bench, let them go take a walk to
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:23.500]   the dining hall, whatever it is, so that they could get a better sense of whether or not
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:28.100]   they really see themselves being there, but on their own and not in the comfort of having
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.340]   their family around them.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.340]   Sure.
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.940]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:36.060]   I loved visiting college campuses when my sister was checking it out.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.060]   She was four years older than me.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.060]   It was so fun.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:43.580]   It was fun to walk around, to imagine the freedom that you'd have once you're there,
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:47.020]   no parental supervision.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.020]   It's amazing.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.540]   I wish I was back in college because I had so much fun.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.540]   Me too.
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:55.740]   I mean, I hear more and more people are taking five years, six years and longer to go to
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.420]   college, to graduate.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:06.860]   Speaking of parents, as a parent, I feel there is a level of anxiety, at least here when
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.900]   I live here in a big city like San Francisco.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:13.380]   There's a lot of type A personalities, real go-getters, people who went to some of the
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:18.320]   top 50 universities and are working at some of the highest paying firms.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:24.500]   If you were to rewind time back to when your children were younger, maybe in middle school
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:30.260]   or elementary school, what would you do differently, if anything?
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.540]   Well, we started the college process early, so that's definitely something that I would
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:40.420]   repeat, but I probably would have went more frequently and I would have been more mindful
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:50.820]   in terms of trying to get them summer internships or summer employment earlier, as opposed to
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.820]   waiting until much later.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.700]   Of course, in retrospect, going through it the second time around would always be better,
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.940]   but that's, I think, what I would do.
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.700]   I would have started earlier in terms of the research process, the conversations that families
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:07.700]   have regarding finances, regarding interests, regarding whether, again, they want to be
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.220]   close to home, far from home.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:15.140]   It's very important, I think, that you make good use of your time, whether it's during
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.020]   after-school activities, during summer activities.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:23.500]   I would be even more mindful of cultivating that for both of my daughters.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.660]   No, that's great.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:32.020]   I have a dilemma to make because my daughter is three, so I guess I have 14 years to figure
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.020]   it out.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.060]   I have two paths to take.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:42.060]   One is the easygoing, non-Tiger Dad path, just explore the world, do long travel, enjoy
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:48.340]   the next 14 years, or to be more strict and to try to push her to get the best grades,
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:54.220]   best test scores, do the most extracurricular activity possible in the 5% hope that she
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:32:00.020]   gets into a top 10 or 20 school.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.500]   What do you think is the better path?
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:06.700]   If you had that choice to live an amazing next 14, 15 years, you can travel around the
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:12.860]   world, live for one or two years at a time, not really stress about the things that you
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:17.740]   don't want to learn, because I think a lot of us, when we go to high school, we have
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.860]   to learn stuff that we don't maybe necessarily all like.
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:25.340]   I didn't like chemistry or super high-level math.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.460]   What are your thoughts about these two paths to take?
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:33.380]   My thoughts are that you have to take a combination of each and understand what you can control
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.780]   and what you don't control.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.180]   What I mean by that is, in terms of test scores, in terms of your grades, I would always encourage
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.140]   students to do the best that you can.
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:45.060]   Immerse yourself in everything your elementary school, middle school, high school has to
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.060]   offer.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.660]   There are some schools that offer multiple advanced placement courses or IB courses,
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:54.140]   and others that don't offer any.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:59.540]   Based on wherever you're going to school, I would always advocate for hard work.
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:05.100]   Hard work is, you know, anything that's worthwhile in life is not easy, but if it's worthwhile,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.820]   it's definitely something that you should do.
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:11.340]   And so, absolutely, trying to be involved with various activities to see what you like
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:16.620]   and don't like, working hard to get good grades, that's something that you absolutely should
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.620]   do.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.820]   But again, I think what you need to understand is that then there's all of the things that
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.500]   are not in your control.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:29.900]   I know many students that have a flawless GPA, have been president of their association,
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:34.900]   whatever club or activity they're involved with, have done the humanitarian things, and
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:38.700]   yet they don't get accepted to every single school that they apply to.
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.180]   And again, it comes down to institutional needs.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:46.940]   Number of students that get accepted in-state, out-of-state, are they looking for more males,
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:51.340]   females, are they looking for more people in a specific major?
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.540]   Those are all things that are out of our control.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:59.300]   So to answer your question, I think you cultivate both paths, but understand again what you
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.300]   control and what you don't.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.380]   >>Ted: No, I love that.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.300]   Control what you can control.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:11.500]   Do you believe, in terms of two variables, nature versus nurture, what is the more dominant
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.500]   variable?
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:18.740]   >>Mike: Well, I definitely think that that, you know, varies, but, you know, you seem
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.500]   like you're a great parent, Sam, and I think you're doing the right thing.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.980]   I mean, you mentioned that your daughter is three years old and, you know, you're already
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.940]   listening to the podcast, and I think that's good.
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:29.940]   I think that's good.
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.820]   And of course, you know, we also have to be mindful of the fact that five, ten, fifteen
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.940]   years from now, who knows what it's going to be like.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:40.100]   Hopefully it's going to be better, but who knows, you know?
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.060]   So that's a tough question to answer.
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:45.820]   >>Sam: Yeah, I mean, I'm always trying to think, as an investor in me, I'm always trying to
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.900]   forecast the future, think about the future.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:52.140]   I try to, you know, hedge against bad outcomes.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:59.100]   And currently, the current hedge is to build wealth, be a present parent, teach the reasons
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:05.380]   why education is important, some practical knowledge, and actually have this podcast.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:11.860]   I have a goal to keep it running for the next fifteen years as a recording to see, you know,
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:16.900]   what dad and mom were thinking about at this time fifteen years later, and maybe something
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:21.180]   that maybe my kids can take over in the future one day.
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.180]   You don't know.
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.300]   There's all these, that's why we take insurance, right?
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.300]   Because there's all these unknown variables.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.140]   >>Mike No, it's true.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:32.340]   But what you do know, right, is that you want your child to work hard, whether it's in the
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.660]   classroom or beyond.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.980]   You want them to be good people.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.180]   You want them to be, you know, humanitarians.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.900]   You want them to invest in their future.
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.420]   You want all of that.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:46.460]   And so, I think all of those things are very noble things to cultivate.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:50.180]   And you know, you're obviously a great role model for your kids.
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.980]   But where is college admissions going to be fifteen years from now?
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.860]   I don't think anyone would know at this point.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.900]   >>Adam Yeah, it is interesting.
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.700]   I just have low expectations.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:06.980]   But you know, just, I mean, five percent acceptance rate literally means, yeah, ninety-five percent
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.660]   people can't get in, and maybe you have to just shoot at different levels of college.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.660]   I went to a state school.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.780]   I went to the College of William & Mary.
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.940]   Right now it has, I think, like a thirty-five percent acceptance rate.
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:22.960]   So it's a, I guess, a top fifty school.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:30.660]   I guess for other parents and students out there, how do you help them manage expectations
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:34.540]   in terms of, you know, trying to get into the top school possible?
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.060]   Let's say they don't get into the top school.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.060]   What happens next?
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.860]   Is life over or not?
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.020]   How do you go about that?
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.020]   >>Mike Life is definitely not over.
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:47.780]   Ironically, I just interviewed Amanda Zuckerman, who happens to be the co-founder of Dormify,
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:53.140]   which is a company where if you need to decorate your dorm, it's the leading company.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:58.420]   And I bring her up because what she explained was that her life dream was to go to the University
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.660]   of Pennsylvania.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.700]   And she was rejected eventually.
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:10.180]   And what happened was, in doing her tours, she found a place called Wash U, Washington
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.180]   University in St. Louis.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.180]   >>Very tough school to get into, actually.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.180]   >>Great school.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:18.740]   Well, so I teased her on the episode to say, "Listen, you know, you were highly academic.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.500]   You probably could have gotten into Penn based on your profile.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.500]   But, you know, they only accept less than ten percent or whatever it is.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:25.820]   So not everyone's going to get in."
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:32.340]   But the moral of the story is that she was disappointed, but she explained how everything
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.820]   happens for a reason.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:39.140]   And the fact that she went to Wash U, and Wash U had certain programs related to students
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:45.460]   and business and finance, that that helped her develop the concept of coming up with
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:50.020]   Dormify, which is frankly a multi-million dollar corporation right now.
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:54.660]   You know, so yes, she was disappointed at the time.
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:38:01.220]   And she explained how her journey at Wash U wasn't always, you know, sweet, but things
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.900]   truly happen for a reason.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:08.900]   So I think that you have to move forward with integrity, do the best that you can, save
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:16.300]   for your future, cultivate your grades, cultivate your activities, and you have to trust that
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.820]   you're going to find the right fit.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.340]   And it's important to understand that there are over 4,000 colleges and universities throughout
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:27.660]   the United States alone, and there is a school for every single student.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.660]   In fact, there's more than just one school for every single student.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:36.420]   But not every single school is the right fit for each student.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:41.140]   So it's very important not to worry about where mom and dad went, where your best friends
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.740]   are going, but to really be mindful of, again, do you want to be far away, do you want to
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:51.840]   be close, do you want to be in a rural, urban, suburban environment, is there a particular
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.700]   major that you're looking for?
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:58.100]   These are things that too many times students neglect because they want to go where their
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.820]   friend is going or they're worried about the sticker on the back of the SUV.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:07.700]   But you know, I guess what I'm trying to say is that there are a lot of gems, a lot of
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.020]   gems out there.
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.060]   And so you have to have an open mind.
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.060]   Yeah.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:17.260]   As a high school principal, what are your thoughts on students considering going to
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:22.480]   a public high school and a private high school?
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.000]   I think that varies based on individual needs.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.940]   My school happens to be a public school.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.860]   It's a highly academic public school.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:36.460]   And frankly, if that's where I lived, I would be extremely happy to have my children go
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.600]   to that school.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.680]   So I think that's a family decision.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.560]   If you live in an area where you're happy with the public schools, and there's a lot
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:48.100]   of great public schools on Long Island, we're very fortunate, extremely fortunate actually,
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.180]   then I would absolutely go with the public schools.
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:57.200]   There are people that live in certain areas, for example, you know, perhaps in the city
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:03.460]   where they prefer to go private as opposed to public or, you know, vice versa.
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:07.380]   It's very individualized based on what the family needs are.
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.380]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:14.020]   And your thoughts, how does that extend to private versus public universities?
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:18.960]   And have you noticed any kind of difference when you're interviewing admissions officers
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.480]   from private or public universities?
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:27.160]   The first difference that stands out for me is basically the percentage of students that
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.680]   they're permitted to accept from out of state.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.600]   Private schools, they have less restrictions.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.520]   They could kind of do what their board of trustees told them to do.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.720]   Whereas many of the state institutions, you know, it's a different governing body, I guess,
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:47.440]   from their states that tell them that, you know, you could only accept up to 30% or whatever
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.480]   the number is from out of state.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.680]   So in my conversations, I've seen differences like that.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.920]   But I guess, like I said earlier, there's over 4,000 colleges and universities.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.720]   So it really comes down to there is no right answer.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:06.000]   It's what is best for a family, you know, what is best for a particular family.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.520]   Growing up, I said earlier, I went to a state school, SUNY Stony Brook here in the state
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.560]   of New York served me well.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.080]   I always joke that I probably wouldn't get in at this point because that school too has
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.400]   become far more competitive.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:20.320]   And both, you know, both of my daughters right now are in private schools.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.320]   They're in small private schools up in Connecticut.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:27.280]   And I wouldn't say there's no right or wrong, in my opinion.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.800]   It's really what the individual family wants and also the student.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.120]   My oldest daughter, initially, Sam, wanted to go to all the RARA schools.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.040]   So we visited Penn State, the University of Maryland.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.700]   And like you said earlier, I had such a great time visiting.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.320]   And my daughter who thought she wanted to go to Penn State because of the RARA feel
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.960]   and everything was like a fish out of water when we actually visited and they were in
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.960]   session.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.800]   We walked into a building that looked like an auditorium and she said, "Dad, what's this?"
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.120]   And I said, "Well, you see all these kids laid out in the hallway?
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.920]   That's because they don't want to go sit in this auditorium that probably has 500 seats
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.960]   in it, whatever it was, 400 seats."
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.080]   I said, "That's class.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.600]   That's a lecture hall."
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.880]   And I could tell that my daughter was panicked.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:13.440]   Then she realized that it was whatever, a six and a half hour drive from my house.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.440]   P.S.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:21.640]   She ended up in a mid-sized school but on the smaller end up in Connecticut.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.280]   And there's no rhyme or reason.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.640]   There's no right or wrong.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.200]   Personally, if I had to go back, I'd love to go to Penn State.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.960]   I would love the big school, the football, the RARA.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.040]   I'd love to go to USC, UCLA.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.040]   I would love that.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.040]   It wasn't for my daughter.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.040]   You're a different person now.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   You're a different person.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.040]   Right.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.080]   You're a different person because my daughter grew up in a suburb.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:43.640]   I grew up in an urban area in the city.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.040]   So people have different needs and different expectations.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.300]   And again, there's no right or wrong.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.400]   And that's the beauty of the college process.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.160]   Let's focus on the positive.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.080]   There's over 4,000 choices.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.640]   There is something for everyone.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:01.000]   You just have to have an open mind, do your research, and surely you'll find the right
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   fit.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Right.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.760]   And now I'm wondering, so both of your daughters are in college now?
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.760]   Yes.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:14.160]   But how has your level of worry changed when they were in high school to try to get into
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:19.520]   college and also now that they're in college, hopefully to get a job that they enjoy doing?
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.920]   I think as a parent, speaking for myself, I feel like I'm maturing as they're growing
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:25.920]   up, right?
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:31.680]   The things that I was so worried about 10 years ago, five years ago, I'm not as worried
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.760]   anymore.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.320]   As a parent, I'm always there for my children.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.520]   One daughter is studying to be a teacher of mathematics.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.960]   She just got her bachelor's degree last week, as a matter of fact.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:44.960]   She just graduated.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.960]   Congratulations.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:46.960]   Thank you.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.480]   And she's staying on one more year to have a four plus one program where you stay on
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.920]   one more year and she'll have her master's degree.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.080]   My youngest, 15 minutes away from her sister, is studying to be a psychologist.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.040]   And I'm just there to support what they want to do.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.920]   I'm just happy that they're exploring, they're working hard.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.760]   I just feel confident that they will find the right fit for them in terms of career.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.960]   My little one, there was a moment where I wasn't sure that she was going to go to college.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:14.960]   And here she is.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.680]   And ironically, just last week, she told me that this was the best year academically that
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.840]   I've ever had in my life.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:20.840]   That's awesome.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:26.560]   So it's just being mature about it, being patient, continuing to be a supportive parent,
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.640]   doing the best that you can, the best that you know how.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.200]   And I just believe it.
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:36.040]   I believe if you do good things, good things eventually will come back.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.880]   You just have to believe in that.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.720]   I really appreciate that perspective.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:46.120]   I really appreciate how you said you are maturing as a parent, as your children mature as well.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.840]   You know, because I'm 45 now.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:48.920]   How old are you, John?
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:49.920]   I'm only 51.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.560]   I'm just a little older than you, Sam.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.560]   Not by much.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.560]   Okay.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.560]   No, no.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.560]   That's good.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.440]   So what I'm saying is when I was in my 20s, I thought, "Oh, when you're 40s, 50s, you're
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.440]   mature.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.720]   You should know a lot of everything."
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.040]   But what I'm discovering is that we continue to mature.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:10.120]   We continue to get wiser over the years.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.360]   Now what's next for the cap?
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.000]   You told me that you've got 20 plus episodes in the pipeline.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.040]   Is your goal to try to interview at least half of the 4,000 out there or the top 500?
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.040]   What's the goal?
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.920]   Well, the goal is definitely to continue.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.120]   I'm going to definitely continue to interview college admissions representatives.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.040]   And again, these are the people that are at the table.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:36.720]   They're the ones who ultimately make the decisions or of course are on the team that make the
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.480]   decisions in the admissions offices.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.880]   And I'm looking to do different things.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.640]   There's one rep who is going to bring, for example, a nursing student on and we're going
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:49.560]   to have a conversation specific to students that are interested in nursing.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:54.680]   There's a couple of panel discussions that I have with some particular schools, right
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.000]   in your neighborhood, by the way, out of California.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.840]   So I'm going to do more panel discussions.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:03.320]   And the next thing for the cap is that I'm going to be interviewing students that are
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:08.520]   actually in college to hear from them what their college journey was like.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.320]   Yes, that'd be great.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.500]   What was their top three?
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.340]   How did they get to their top three?
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.120]   What would they do differently?
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.960]   So that's going to be the next step as well.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:21.240]   Shortly, I'm going to start more episodes where we're going to talk to students as well.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:26.480]   Oh, I think that'd be fascinating to hear from students directly in the college, in
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.480]   the university.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.480]   That's correct.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.240]   Also, parents who were going through that process to help guide them on the way.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.960]   I think that'd be fascinating.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:33.960]   I agree.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.280]   That's why I'm going to do it.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:40.440]   And again, like I said at the beginning, I came up with this idea and it was funny because
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:44.480]   when I reached out to representatives and they said yes, that's when I panicked because
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.720]   I didn't know how to record virtually, how to edit, how do you get it on Spotify, Apple,
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.400]   Google, and all of that.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.960]   So like any other good person, you go to Google and you learn so much, right?
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.440]   And so quickly.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.280]   But I'm having so much fun.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:03.840]   My analytics have exceeded my every expectation and people are listening and so I'm going
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.120]   to just keep going.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.440]   It's just, I just love it.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:13.160]   I just love helping people and I know how stressed I was as a parent and I'm someone
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.160]   that's in the field of education.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.440]   So I can only imagine the parents out there that, again, they don't know the questions
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.840]   to ask necessarily.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.640]   Maybe they're skeptical about reaching out to the rep.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.800]   So that's the point of the podcast.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:29.380]   It's me talking to reps and I don't get every question answered.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:34.360]   But the point is, listen to the episode and hopefully that prompts you to come up with
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.920]   better follow-up questions so that when you meet with a rep, whether it's at a college
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:45.000]   tour or at your local college fair, you're going to be better prepared to ask good follow-up
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   questions.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   Right, right.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.680]   I have an interesting scenario analysis for you, John.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:57.320]   That is, let's say there was a different time and 10 years from now, the CAP podcast
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.360]   has grown massive.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:04.920]   It's got, I don't know, 100,000 downloads per episode or a million listens per month.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:12.800]   It's the top 0.001% podcast in the world and the number one podcast about college admissions
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.280]   process.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.600]   And then you had children, right?
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.200]   So you had teenage children who are applying to college.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.200]   You're world famous.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.360]   Every single college admissions officer knows you, parents, students, anybody who wants
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.280]   to go to college.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:36.080]   How much would that, do you think that would help your daughters get into a top school?
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.080]   Everybody knows who you are.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:43.400]   They're like, "Wow, if we admit John's daughters, we can get mentioned and have a good experience."
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.120]   And he knows what it's all about.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.120]   So it's funny.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:53.920]   I just interviewed the director of admissions at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:49:00.920]   And one of the examples that he gave was that some people think that, you know, obviously
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.340]   it's in Chicago.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:06.760]   Some people think that getting a letter from Barack Obama, who obviously has a lot of ties
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.000]   to Chicago or Michael Jordan, right?
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.600]   Who obviously has ties to Chicago.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:18.600]   So what he said was, all that means is that either they know Michael Jordan or Barack
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.640]   Obama or they know someone who knows them.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.600]   He said, from the admissions perspective, it means nothing.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.880]   So he said it.
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:26.880]   You got to listen to him.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.880]   No way.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.880]   Wait, what university is this?
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:29.880]   University of Chicago?
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:30.880]   University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:31.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:33.880]   Nah, really?
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.880]   He said that in the episode.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.760]   And so, you know, I have no false hopes.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:43.640]   I do want to cultivate the podcast, but thank God my daughters are already in college.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:44.640]   Who knows?
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.640]   Maybe one day it will help my grandchildren.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.640]   Right.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.440]   I mean, that's the way to think about it.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.240]   You keep extending the future.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:54.400]   I'm going to take the – I'm going to believe that having a letter from Barack Obama or
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:58.000]   Michael Jordan will help because let's say you're really good friends with them, one
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.080]   of them, like, "Hey, Barack, can you come speak to my class?
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.600]   Can you drop in or give a commencement?"
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.320]   And the school doesn't have to pay you a hundred grand or whatever that is, right?
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   I don't know.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:16.320]   But, yes, I would say helping people, being known in a positive way is a positive for
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.520]   your children.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:23.280]   And so what you're doing I think is definitely a positive for, yeah, maybe your future grandchildren.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:28.920]   Great to think about that because in personal finance, as soon as you start saving and investing
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:33.600]   for something and if that something is your child, your most valuable asset, I think you
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.600]   get much more motivated.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:38.800]   And if you get to the point where you have enough and then you start thinking, "Well,
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   what's the point?"
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.080]   Well, if you have grandchildren, you're blessed with them, you might start getting
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.720]   motivated again.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:45.720]   Absolutely.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:46.720]   Absolutely.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.240]   But for me, it's helping people, right?
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.880]   And I know that we talk about money and saving and it's important.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.880]   Yes, you need money to live.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:59.480]   So it's very important, especially the cost of living in California, the cost of living
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:00.480]   in New York.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.480]   It's very expensive.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:06.520]   For me, I get very excited at the fact that I'm helping people.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.720]   The number of downloads, again, far exceeded my every expectation.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.360]   And so this is something that I'm never going to stop.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:18.400]   I'm just never going to stop because 100 years from now, Sam, guess what?
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:22.400]   You and I and everyone listening, we're probably not going to be here anymore, right?
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:27.160]   And so while we're here, in addition to, yes, planning for our futures and being financially
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:32.000]   literate and all of that, but we might as well, while we're here, help each other.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.480]   And to me, there's nothing more important and that's why I do what I do.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.480]   Absolutely.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.520]   So if you were a high school student, John, and I was an admissions officer at a top school,
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.200]   I think I would accept you.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.080]   I don't actually care about your grades too much.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:52.400]   If you got a B or higher or 1,000 on the SAT or higher, but because you're doing this,
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.640]   I would say, "You know what?
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.040]   You're unique in doing this and I think you're committed.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.480]   You're going to gut it out and you're going to help a lot of people as you continue."
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.720]   So I would definitely accept you.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.400]   Well, I appreciate that, Sam.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.560]   And Sam, you're doing awesome work as well, by the way.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.600]   I have listened to some of your episodes.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.600]   You're awesome.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:15.080]   I wish that my family as a whole, I wish we were more financial literate as you seem to
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.800]   be with the work that you're doing.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.320]   So keep going because people need you as well.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.880]   I appreciate that.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.620]   So in closing, we've covered a lot.
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:28.680]   Any final tips for parents or students in the college admissions process with their
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:32.440]   children and where can people find you?
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:37.120]   So they could find me, my website is collegeadmissionstalk.com.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:42.520]   My email address is collegeadmissionstalk@gmail.com.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:47.480]   And the name of the podcast is The College Admissions Process Podcast, which could be
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:52.520]   found anywhere you listen to podcasts, Spotify, Apple, Google, and what have you.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:56.700]   And so my final advice is start early if you can.
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:01.160]   And what I said in the beginning in terms of recognizing what each part of the application
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:06.400]   represents and how it's a marketing package where each piece has to build upon the next.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:11.000]   And be mindful, as we said a couple of times throughout the episode, of what you control.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.480]   You know, you do control starting early and working hard on your activity sheet, your
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:18.880]   transcript, your essay, and all of the other parts.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.680]   And then there are institutional needs that we don't control.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:28.960]   So just be mindful of that and start early as a family to talk about the financial needs
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:34.920]   of the family and whether or not you want to be far away, close, big, small, you know,
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.560]   and all of those questions.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.740]   And good luck to everybody.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:38.740]   Good luck to everybody.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.440]   And I hope to see you on the podcast.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.440]   All right.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.000]   Well, thanks a lot, John.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   And I appreciate your time.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.280]   I really, really appreciate all the wisdom you've provided.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.880]   Well, thank you so much, Sam.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.880]   You're doing great work.
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.960]   It was an honor and a pleasure to be here today.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.760]   Good luck to everybody and all that you're doing out there.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.120]   Thank you.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:56.400]   Take care.
