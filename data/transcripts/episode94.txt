[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.360]   - What's going on?
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.180]   Nick Loper here.
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.160]   Welcome to the Side Hustle Show.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.160]   This is episode 94, tax saving tips for side hustlers.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.720]   It's tax season, at least here in the US,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.720]   and that means that you may be thinking
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.560]   about how much you owe Uncle Sam,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.000]   or hopefully, how much you're gonna get back.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.920]   But one thing is for certain, and that's that,
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.960]   as a side hustler, you have some distinct advantages
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.960]   come April 15th that the regular old W-2 earners do not.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.720]   And here to help break down all of those advantages
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.640]   is Joshua Sheets from RadicalPersonalFinance.com
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.000]   and the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.240]   If you're a money geek, you're gonna like this one.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.920]   Or just if you don't like giving your hard-earned money
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.640]   away to the government, you're gonna like this one.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.680]   Josh is a certified financial planner
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.440]   and has a whole host of other acronyms after his name.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.360]   I'm not sure if they all mean,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.400]   but I'll take it to signify that he's a smart dude.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.800]   There's some really juicy stuff in this call,
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.600]   especially in the second half of this interview.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.040]   But like the disclaimer on his site,
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.360]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com says,
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.200]   it would be dumb to take the financial advice
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.440]   of some random dude on the internet.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.200]   So be sure to always do your own homework,
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.360]   your own due diligence, and your own research
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.840]   before putting any of this into action.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.000]   And I'll let that serve as my disclaimer as well.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.140]   Now, as is per the usual, all my notes and highlights,
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.000]   along with Joshua's top tips for tax savings
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.600]   are available to you in free downloadable PDF

[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.240]   News and updates before we get into a real quick update
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.520]   on the public coaching project.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.000]   Thank you, thank you, thank you so much
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   for all the people who applied,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.800]   got more than 70 applications for this thing.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.560]   So I'm going through them as fast as I can
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.680]   and we'll sit on the progress.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.480]   I really, honestly did not expect half that many.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   So really overwhelmed and flattered with the response.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.760]   I just know this is gonna be a ton of fun to put together
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.800]   and see what comes out of it.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.000]   But I do wanna make sure to be fair to everyone
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.960]   who took the time to submit.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.280]   So it's gonna take a little bit of effort
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.000]   to go through all those.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.480]   And with that, let's get into the show with Joshua Sheets.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.280]   Or the first question that I get a lot of the time is,
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.840]   you know, when do I need to incorporate?
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.180]   Do I need to set up a legal entity for my side hustle?
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.560]   - So you have to start with the most difficult question
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.580]   I get, don't you?
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.760]   (laughing)
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.600]   So this one's kind of interesting
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.280]   because the answer is extremely nuanced.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.200]   And I'm gonna give some information on it,
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.880]   then I'm gonna kind of sidestep around it.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.120]   But this is actually one of the more difficult questions
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.100]   to answer because there is no one right answer.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.840]   Most people do immediately start with this
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.340]   and people talking about the rich tax code
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.520]   and the poor people's tax code.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.960]   And they say, well, the rich people get all the tax breaks.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.000]   But that's not, at least in all the years I've studied tax,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.720]   I can't find any of those tax breaks for the rich.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.680]   All the tax breaks go for the poor.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.000]   But there are two tax codes,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.440]   and they're the business tax code
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.880]   and the personal tax code.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.040]   The mistake that many people make
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.120]   is they immediately think that in order to take advantage
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.560]   of the business tax code,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.120]   they have to establish some sort of corporate entity.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.600]   They have to set up Joshua Sheets Inc.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.440]   or Joshua Sheets LLC.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.800]   And that is not the case.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.920]   All you need to do is simply declare yourself
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.520]   to be in business and then pursue your business
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.160]   and you can immediately take advantage
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.520]   of the business tax code.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.680]   So this question of should I incorporate
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.080]   is very challenging to answer
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.180]   because it's extremely fact dependent
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.540]   on one individual situation.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.200]   Now, the way I would answer it is I would say
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.000]   probably don't worry about it,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.680]   at least not to start with.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.120]   Again, each structure has its own advantages
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.160]   and disadvantages.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.440]   And if you ever read an article where somebody says,
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.960]   always do something, always file an LLC
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.920]   or always set up an S corporation,
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.080]   flip to the next article
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.560]   'cause it's probably not to be trusted
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.800]   unless they're just simply saying,
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.400]   here's one aspect of why you should.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.880]   Generally, in my experience,
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.600]   people are displaying their ignorance
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   with articles like that,
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.840]   not recognizing all of the different variables
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.640]   that would impact the situation.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.140]   So I'll give some of the variables.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.720]   The first thing I would say is just simply focus first
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.360]   on simplicity of the business.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.360]   The goal is not to incorporate so that you sound fancy.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.800]   The goal is not side hustle nation, Inc.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.840]   So everyone thinks you're big and impressive.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.920]   The goal is to have a business
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.520]   that prints money for you, right?
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.000]   So once we start with a business
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.420]   that's printing money for us,
[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.840]   then we can fix everything else.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.240]   So just simply go get started in business
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.840]   and don't worry about the tax stuff.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.560]   And then once you're making some money,
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.040]   we can fix all the entity stuff and fix all the tax stuff.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.360]   And that's fairly normal.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.480]   Most businesses will go through a progression
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.640]   and there's a natural progression
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.700]   where they may start off as a simple sole proprietorship.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.080]   They may transition into some form
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.640]   of limited liability company or some form of S corporation.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.480]   And they may transition onto a C corporation.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.360]   But the key is be making money.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.720]   - What I kind of, I guess what I would recommend
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.920]   to most people who ask me that is,
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.960]   I would, like you said, focus on generating revenue,
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.000]   focus on the business side of it.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.120]   And kind of you can run everything as a sole proprietor,
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.320]   still have the benefits of being a business.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.060]   And you're not gonna have the liability protection
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.160]   of that third party entity at first,
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.720]   but you can set that up after the fact.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.320]   Now, my setup is a little bit more complicated.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.220]   I have an LLC with an S corp election
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.660]   because at some point I read that you could save
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.040]   on self-employment tax by doing that.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.400]   And it makes things a lot more complicated.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.700]   And for some years during that stretch,
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.400]   the revenue probably doesn't or did not justify
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.160]   that extra layer, that extra complexity.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.080]   - Now in getting started, the sole proprietorship
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.000]   is the key and that's the best place to start
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.940]   'cause it's simple.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.840]   And the only tax form you need is to file a Schedule C
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.960]   on your normal personal return.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.600]   And you can basically file an unlimited number
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.800]   of Schedule Cs.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.180]   So if you are building up a side hustle
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.600]   and you're pursuing a side hustle for six months
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.860]   in one business, and then you're pursuing another one
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.940]   for four months in another, and then a third one
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.180]   you're picking up at the end of the year with three months,
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.020]   you can file a separate Schedule C
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.420]   for each of those individual businesses.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.380]   And that would make sense
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.500]   if they're distinct, unique businesses.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.060]   Now, the question, I mean, people say,
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.460]   well, when should I collapse them?
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.780]   You collapse them when it makes sense.
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.980]   So if businesses are integrated
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.260]   and everything is just an offshoot of that,
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.980]   then you go ahead and set those up.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.420]   So at this stage, for me, radical personal finance
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.980]   is simply a sole proprietorship.
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.220]   And the reason that it's a sole proprietorship
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.740]   is to date, it is not profitable.
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.980]   It is a pure loss.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.100]   And so one of the things that's most valuable
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.620]   about a sole proprietorship is that there is essentially
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.240]   what they call in the tax business,
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.660]   I have an unlimited ability to deduct, excuse me,
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.840]   to deduct my losses as an ordinary loss.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.500]   So all of my losses with radical personal finance
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.380]   are fully deductible against my other forms
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.800]   and sources of income.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.780]   If I were, as an example,
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.940]   if I had established an S corporation
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.100]   and if I were choosing that to be my business entity,
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.660]   then under that scenario, my losses are only deductible,
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.540]   what's called up to my basis, up to the amount of money
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.820]   and capital that I've contributed to the company.
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.980]   And depending on the structure of a business,
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.500]   that may or may not be a problem.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.660]   So it may be that somebody is contributing the capital
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.260]   to a business where they, you know, it's gonna be limited
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.420]   and that's the only losses they're gonna be able to take.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.800]   Or it may be that they're anticipating
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.460]   that there'll be losses in excess
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.820]   of the capital contribution.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.940]   And that's the case for me with radical personal finance.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.140]   So at this stage, it's a sole proprietorship.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.140]   Now, as the business becomes profitable,
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.180]   then at that point in time,
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.900]   I'll transition it into another form of entity,
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.260]   most likely an LLC taxed as an S corporation.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.300]   - Okay, okay.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.140]   So if you're going through the expense
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.220]   and the headache of setting up this corporation,
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.860]   you may actually be hurting yourself by not,
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.740]   especially in like the early years of this business,
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.340]   by not being able to write off those,
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.340]   especially if you have some capital investment,
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.820]   you're buying websites and hosting and graphic design
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.620]   and marketing and all this stuff
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.100]   that you may be needing to spend money on,
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.420]   developers, contractors and stuff like that.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.260]   - Exactly.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.940]   - Okay, so there's an advantage
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.020]   to staying as a sole proprietor for that.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.060]   So do I need to file anything
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.940]   with like the Secretary of State to do that,
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.020]   with like my local city, with the federal government?
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:29.860]   Does any of that matter?
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.540]   Or do I just say, "Hey, I'm Nick, I'm in business, hire me."
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.340]   - Yeah, that depends on whether or not,
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.580]   that depends on the rules of your state,
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.620]   but in general, you can probably just be in business.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.100]   Now the challenge is when people start writing you checks,
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.820]   are they writing checks to Nick
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.420]   or are they writing checks to Side Hustle Nation?
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.260]   - Okay, okay.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.980]   - And so if you need the people
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.660]   to write checks to Side Hustle Nation,
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.300]   you'll file a simple form with your state called a DBA,
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.300]   which stands for Doing Business As,
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.820]   and all that is is it's Nick Loper DBA Side Hustle Nation,
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.580]   and then that allows you to take that down.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.140]   You can open up a business checking account
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.300]   in your business name,
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.680]   and then people can write checks to Side Hustle Nation.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.460]   For some businesses, they never need that.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.460]   You know, I've run businesses for years in the past
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.580]   where people just made checks out to Joshua Sheets
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.480]   and it was no problem,
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.600]   or there was a cash transaction and that's no problem.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.660]   But then in some businesses, it can look a little strange
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.580]   if somebody's writing a check out to Joshua Sheets
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.220]   and they'd much rather write a check out
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.620]   to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.500]   - Okay, okay.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.900]   Yeah, plus you feel, I don't know, you feel kind of cool.
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.420]   It's like you're doing business as.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.420]   I don't know, I was back in college,
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.900]   I first set up my very first company.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.980]   I was in a rush to incorporate
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.900]   because I thought it would be really cool
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.260]   and then I could get a tax ID
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.380]   and I could set up a bank account and all this nonsense.
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.340]   And I was like, none of this really mattered,
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.460]   but it was just maybe a little bit of an ego trip.
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.540]   - Right, and that may have its place.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.380]   It might be that for one business,
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.820]   you need to look big and you need to look impressive.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.780]   Certainly in many things, perception is reality
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.580]   and that you need to understand
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.020]   how people are going to perceive you in your activities.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.060]   But for many people, it's just, it's overkill.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.800]   And what's not talked about enough
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.220]   is people always talk about the advantages of incorporation,
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.940]   but they never talk about the disadvantages of incorporation.
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.660]   And the primary reason to establish a corporate entity
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.620]   is for liability protection.
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.580]   So you have to ask yourself,
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.380]   do I actually face significant amounts of liability
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.400]   that can be protected from at a corporate level?
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.940]   And for me sitting here on my computer,
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.460]   creating a podcast, what's my liability?
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:37.020]   My primary liability is if I were to give investment advice
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.660]   of some kind that were pointed out to be improper
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.620]   in some way, and if I had represented myself
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.140]   as an investment advisor,
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.180]   then I'm personally liable for that.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.020]   But I don't have a team of delivery trucks.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:48.860]   - What's your best investment advice?
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.680]   (laughing)
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.540]   - You're not gonna get me there,
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.380]   been doing this too long.
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.760]   But I don't have a team of delivery trucks out on the roads
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.940]   where one of my delivery drivers gets in an accident.
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.580]   I'm not managing a multi-unit apartment building
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.560]   where it's possible that one of my tenants
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.860]   could be injured falling down the stairwell.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.300]   So any liability exposure that I have
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.300]   is primarily personal liability.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.380]   And a corporate entity doesn't protect me
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.520]   against acts of personal liability.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.860]   So there's very little need for me at this stage
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.420]   in my business to have that liability protection.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.780]   - Yeah, so for people starting out,
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.420]   I think the gist of this conversation was,
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.820]   at least in California, save the $800 franchise fee
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.260]   and just do sole proprietor until you've got some revenue
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.780]   to justify it, and then you wanna go big
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.420]   and be official and all that stuff
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.540]   instead of hyper global megacorp right out of the gate.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.740]   Actually, do you remember in Four Hour Workweek
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.180]   how he talks about setting up his title, right?
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.060]   Instead of being president and CEO,
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.580]   it's like VP of Marketing, Tim Ferriss.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.620]   And so to make the company appear a little bit bigger,
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.500]   like there was other players and setting up
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.980]   these different voicemail options, like press one,
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.580]   and it all like wood forward to him anyways.
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.420]   - That's funny.
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:07.180]   - How about some common deductions for side hustlers?
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.100]   - There are as many deductions for side hustlers
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.660]   as there are expenses that are incurred in their business.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.860]   And the key, I always start with deductions,
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.220]   is remember this, there's no 100% tax bracket.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.300]   We've gotten in the United States up to as high as 94%.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.900]   That was the highest tax bracket back in 1945,
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.980]   but we've not yet gotten to 100%.
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.340]   So you never wanna take a deduction
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.900]   just simply for the sake of taking a deduction.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.140]   And today the rates are, there's nowhere near 94%.
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.420]   - 94%, so every dollar you earned,
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.420]   you would, after a certain point,
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.820]   every dollar you earned, you would keep six cents.
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.220]   - In 1945, every dollar you earned in excess of $200,000
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.580]   was taxed at a 94% rate.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.100]   - Oh my gosh, and people are complaining
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.220]   about the tax rates now.
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.260]   Oh my God, well, it's come down since then.
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.540]   - Yep, it does.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.180]   So that's the key to keep in mind.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.060]   And there are some guiding principles,
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.180]   and I'll give you some examples
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.220]   that would be specifically helpful for side hustlers.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.900]   But the problem with going straight to specific examples
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.140]   is if you don't have a framework
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.200]   into which you can fit those examples,
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.540]   then you're often subject to the whims
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.140]   of whatever the next article that you read is.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.420]   A couple of pieces of the framework.
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.300]   Number one, run your business right.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.200]   Simply pursue your business and focus on profitability.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.440]   And then over time, you'll naturally have expenses
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.820]   that are associated with the business.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.700]   If you're doing something
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.260]   only for the purpose of the deduction,
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.660]   you probably have a problem.
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.860]   And the only expenses that you can deduct in a business
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.140]   are the expenses that are ordinary and necessary
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.380]   to the course of your specific business.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.300]   That's about it.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.660]   That's basically the guiding line.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.540]   So people ask about all kinds of stuff.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.380]   Can I deduct this?
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.200]   Can I deduct that?
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.180]   Can I deduct the other thing?
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.020]   The answer is, well, is this an ordinary
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.380]   and necessary business expense to you and to your business?
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.220]   So I like to joke, I love to travel,
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.140]   and so I like to joke about the filming
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.260]   of the Lord of the Rings movies in New Zealand.
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.820]   Do you think that Peter Jackson's expenses
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.260]   of going to New Zealand
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.580]   and filming the Lord of the Rings movies were deductible?
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.540]   - No, for sure. - Of course they were.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.100]   Of course they were, 'cause they're associated with him
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.760]   as a movie, creating movies.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.140]   Now, if I decide to take my family on a family vacation,
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.780]   and we just get on an airplane and go to New Zealand,
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.580]   are my expenses deductible?
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.020]   - Well, are you gonna have a meeting there?
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.200]   Are you gonna have a client meeting?
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.460]   Are you gonna make some deals?
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.540]   - Yeah, unless there is something specific,
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.220]   and that's the reason why we're going,
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.300]   which if I'm going as a front man
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.700]   for leading out in the Lord of the Rings movies,
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.380]   then yes, it would be deductible.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.300]   But if I'm just going on vacation,
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.020]   and it's clearly vacation, then it's not deductible.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.060]   Now, here's how this matters.
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.060]   Let's say that I'm just going on vacation,
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.060]   but I say, you know what, I'm gonna make a movie,
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.780]   and I'm gonna toss this thing up on YouTube,
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.860]   so I film a family movie while I'm there on YouTube,
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.260]   and I put it out on YouTube.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.120]   Are my expenses now deductible?
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.580]   No, because I don't have any history.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.540]   I don't have any ability to prove that I'm actually,
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.860]   you know, that this is actually
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.140]   a serious business expectation.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.360]   - Well, this could be a fine line, right?
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.660]   What if you're just starting out,
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.900]   and you have the aspirations of being a future YouTube star,
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.380]   and this is the first film of your business?
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.700]   - Exactly, okay, so this is a fine line,
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.160]   and this is where you have to look
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.700]   at each individual situation.
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.700]   So start with the perspective of,
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.580]   this needs to be an ordinary and necessary expense.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.340]   Now, the other thing, to be able to deduct something
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.380]   in a business, there must be a profit motive
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.860]   under the business, and that's what the IRS says.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.340]   You don't actually ever have to show a profit.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.540]   In fact, there are courses, excuse me,
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.400]   cases in the tax court where businesses have lost money
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.580]   for 20 consecutive years, and all of those losses
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.560]   were fully deductible, but there must be a profit motive,
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.700]   and so there are a few facts that the IRS would look at
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.520]   to say, are these expenses deductible?
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.300]   The first one is the manner in which you carry
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.440]   on the activity, so are you actually pursuing this
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.740]   in a business-like way?
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.980]   Example, if I'm gonna film a video,
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.600]   and this is gonna be the first part of my YouTube stardom,
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.180]   then I'm gonna make sure that I'm probably
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.480]   gonna call ahead, I'm gonna schedule appointments
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.940]   there in New Zealand, if I'm gonna be filming,
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.800]   I'm gonna be applying for film licenses and film permits.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.140]   I'm gonna get an authorization
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.840]   from whatever authorizations I would need to go,
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.540]   or just need to get, I would be arranging things
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.060]   in advance, coordinating equipment,
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.880]   carrying it on in a business-like manner.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:25.000]   Number two is the expertise of you and your advisors.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.660]   So if you have some history, or have invested some study
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.500]   and some knowledge into your film production capacities,
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.100]   that would be a mark in your favor,
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.100]   that whereas if I just came in off the street
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.220]   and bought an iPhone on the way to the airport
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.580]   and said, oh, I'm gonna film a movie,
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.460]   that's probably not so impressive.
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.480]   Number three would be the time and effort
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.560]   expended by you in carrying out your business activity.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.960]   So if I go to New Zealand and I say, you know what,
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.960]   I'm planning this for weeks and weeks and months
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.360]   in advance, coordinating everything that's needed,
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.760]   and then I go and I'm doing my filming there for a week,
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.440]   doesn't matter that I had fun there while I was filming.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.520]   Or it doesn't matter even if I was there for a month
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.000]   and I had fun while I was filming.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.520]   The question is, what was the time and effort
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.920]   overall expended, and was this actually pursued
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.560]   in an excellent way?
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.620]   - Okay, so if I'm buying fabric and I have the intention
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.000]   of setting up an Etsy shop, there's gonna be
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.680]   some paper trail, there's gonna be some direction
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.020]   to say, oh, I'm gonna turn this into Nick's custom handbags
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.640]   or whatever and put that on Etsy,
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.540]   or I'm gonna take some photography court,
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.780]   like advanced iPhone photography, right,
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.660]   and I'm gonna turn that into some photo booth business
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.740]   or something like that.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.260]   There's some, okay, so it sounds like there's some ways
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.180]   to make these expense.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.780]   How about everyday stuff?
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.060]   If I'm, since most side hustlers are doing this
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.500]   from their home office, from their kitchen table,
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.260]   from their spare bedroom and stuff,
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.540]   like my internet expense, my cell phone,
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.460]   any stuff like that, is there, can I say,
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.460]   okay, a certain percentage of that every month
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.620]   could be a business expense?
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.960]   - So each of those is different, and yes,
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.700]   there are some common expenses.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.420]   So home office, utility costs, some other ones
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.620]   are probably more common, meals and entertainment
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.340]   with prospective clients or prospective business associates,
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:22.740]   business travel, all of these have their pluses and minuses.
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.580]   Now they're different.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.100]   The cell phone is actually the most liberal these days,
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.020]   where for me, I've only deducted the cost of my cell phone
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.200]   in my business and have for years.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.940]   The IRS has made that one, and there's some specific
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.260]   private letter rulings where I would,
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.980]   I certainly, if I didn't have a business,
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.460]   I certainly wouldn't do that, but it's so hard
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.340]   for them to differentiate, and because now
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.780]   things are fully integrated, that the cell phone
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.020]   is one of those where they're a little bit less
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.060]   likely to be all persnickety on it.
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.380]   The longstanding rule for business, for telephones,
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.500]   was you needed to have a separate business line,
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.740]   and you could deduct the business line.
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.980]   You needed to keep a call log in your office.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.220]   But the cell phones, I'm not aware of any recent
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.820]   court cases where that one is coming into focus.
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.660]   And so that can be a real benefit.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.420]   Now, home office, things like internet,
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.700]   here you get into the home office rules,
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.780]   which is an area of real fear for many people.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.260]   Many people don't take home office deductions
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.220]   simply because they're too scared to take it,
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.180]   and they're worried about triggering an audit with the IRS.
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.380]   And the rules on the home office are fairly straightforward.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.720]   The office needs to be used to conduct administrative
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.380]   or management activities of your trade or business,
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.020]   and there must not be another office where you conduct
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.100]   substantial administrative activities.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.840]   And then you must use the home office
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.540]   for business exclusively.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.940]   So depending on your actual setup at home,
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.700]   as long as you meet those standards,
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.340]   that that's where you do administrative
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.440]   and management activities of your trade or business,
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.460]   that's where you don't have another location
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.940]   where you do substantial administrative activities
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.080]   for your business, and the space is used exclusively
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.180]   for your business, and that's the big one,
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.140]   'cause most people don't do that.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.060]   They say, "Oh, I've got the spare bedroom,"
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.820]   but if I were to look at a picture of the room,
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.900]   there's a computer in the corner,
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.060]   there's kids' beds and a guest bed,
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.620]   and there's a bunch of personal effects and personal books
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.780]   and all kinds of personal stuff all over the desk.
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.760]   What you should do if you're gonna deduct that,
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.720]   clear out half the room and make half the room business only
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.540]   and there should be no personal effects
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.740]   in that half of the room.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.020]   There should only be business and snap a picture
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.820]   every six months of it and put it in your tax record files
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.360]   demonstrating that here it is.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.200]   Here's my home office.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.460]   - Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.280]   - The key is proof, and this is the big one,
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.380]   is that he with the most proof according to the law
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.420]   is going to win.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.740]   So if you're gonna do something like deduct a home office,
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.780]   yes, every January 1st and probably January 1st
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.460]   and June 1st, snap a picture of the space.
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.180]   If you're going to be using your car
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.140]   and deducting your mileage,
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.660]   you need to have a careful mileage log in the car
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.380]   and you need to have careful records,
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.220]   and this is where most people don't,
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.100]   the reason that most people don't take all the deductions
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.700]   to which they are entitled by law
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.400]   is simply because they don't have good records,
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.860]   and because they don't have good records,
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.140]   they're nervous about it,
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.360]   and because they're nervous about it,
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.700]   they're scared to go and say,
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.020]   oh, I'm gonna take these deductions.
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.220]   If you have good records and you've built yourself
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.140]   and you can build an audit proof tax records,
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.460]   then you'll save substantial money just by doing that.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.820]   - Yeah, and I've gotta think that,
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.680]   unless you're a really, really high earner in your day job
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.880]   and you're showing some big business loss
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.760]   on your Schedule C,
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.200]   like I've gotta reason that the IRS has bigger fish to fry
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.240]   than coming after a side hustler
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.280]   who's trying to make a thousand bucks a month
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.520]   on the side or something.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:48.120]   So I'm looking up at my home office,
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.760]   so the treadmill desk takes up half the office,
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.600]   takes up half the room,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.660]   so I just need to take a picture of it every now and again.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.500]   - Right.
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.180]   - The problem with tax savings is there is no one thing.
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.400]   People always ask me, Joshua, what's the one thing I can do?
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.460]   There is no one thing.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.560]   There are just dozens and dozens and dozens
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.880]   of little things that you can do,
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.940]   which add up to a lot over time.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.140]   - Okay, okay.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.540]   Any commonly overlooked things
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:15.540]   that sometimes your clients are not claiming
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.420]   that they should, like we talked about the home office
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.400]   'cause people are scared.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.900]   Anything other similar ones like that?
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.860]   - I'll give three.
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.860]   Number one, people don't move when they should.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.380]   And this is, in my opinion, probably the biggest one
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.480]   is that people don't look into moving.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.680]   And they don't look into moving from one county to another
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.740]   where there are lower taxes.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.180]   They don't look into moving from one state to another.
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.460]   One of the things that opens up
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.100]   when you get your income disconnected
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.880]   from your geographic location
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.120]   is you have the ability to earn from high-income places
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.100]   and live in low-expense places.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.460]   And so whether this was Tim Ferriss's geo-arbitrage
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.540]   or whether it's just simply--
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.380]   - Earning dollars, paying in rupees and living on pesos.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.580]   - Right, and this can be done within the United States
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.940]   or it can be done outside of the United States.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.020]   I did an example on my show recently
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.220]   where I calculated just a very simple,
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.940]   kind of somewhat ordinary example of moving from,
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.500]   I think it was, I used Pennsylvania.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.780]   And I said, let's say that there was a young,
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.740]   like a 30-year-old couple earning
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.260]   a couple hundred thousand dollars a year of income.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.000]   And the only change they made was to move from a state
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.780]   that has a state income tax
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.460]   to a state that doesn't have an income tax.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.080]   They moved from Pennsylvania to Texas
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.660]   or moved from Pennsylvania to Florida
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.420]   or even to a place like Tennessee
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.860]   where there is a more advantageous personal tax situation
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.860]   even though there are still some taxes, still saves.
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.100]   Well, if you save 5,000 bucks,
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.540]   that decision right there
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.540]   over the course of a 40-year career,
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.180]   that can be, depending on the investment return,
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.300]   that can be anywhere from a million to $2 million
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.740]   of assets available at middle or older age, at 65,
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.980]   if we're gonna do the traditional retirement idea.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.320]   A simple decision like what state do you live in
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.040]   can be a difference of a million extra bucks.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.920]   But it's very rare that somebody asks me and says,
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.780]   so Joshua, I carefully sat down and thought about my state.
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.540]   There was an anecdote recently.
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.000]   You live in California, right, Nick?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.660]   - I call it the sandal tax, but go ahead.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.960]   - So there was an anecdote.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.840]   Tony Robbins recently wrote a book on money
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.040]   and it was much loved.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.800]   But one of the anecdotes, very popularly,
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.400]   it was everywhere in every podcast.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.320]   He did a great job with his marketing of the book.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.280]   But one anecdote that he told in that
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.880]   was he finally, a few years ago,
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.880]   New York, excuse me, California adjusted the tax system
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.380]   and they increased taxes retroactively
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.080]   on the residents of the state.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.880]   And finally, after years, he had enough.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.400]   So he went on kind of this massive,
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.080]   him take massive action.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.700]   So he went around looking for a new place to live.
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.080]   Well, he wound up in Palm Beach, Florida,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:45.920]   right where I live.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.280]   I live in West Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.360]   And he wound up buying a brand new house on Palm Beach.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.960]   And he bought, there's different scales of Palm Beach,
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.840]   but he bought it at one of the more expensive places
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.680]   where you have the ocean on one side of your property
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.640]   and you have the intercoastal waterway on the other side.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.560]   So you have water on two sides of your house.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.120]   And he bought this massive, brand new mansion.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.680]   And he said he paid for the entire cost of that mansion,
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.100]   purely with the savings from his
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.480]   California state income tax for six years.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.760]   Paid for the entire cost of a massive mansion
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.640]   with only just the savings on his state income tax.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.880]   And the challenge is, you say, well, I'm not Tony Robbins.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.640]   Yeah, but a million extra bucks--
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.480]   - It adds up. - For a building
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.000]   from a 5% state.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.360]   It adds up over time.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.600]   - Yeah, it's kind of crazy to think about.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.720]   Like, and that's the thing.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.400]   So we're three and a half hours away from state line
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.400]   in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.840]   No state income tax, no business tax.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.680]   It's just like they make all their money from gambling.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.960]   So it's like, okay, they don't need it.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.000]   It's just a completely different environment.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.200]   And it really makes you think,
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.840]   like over, and you bring up a good point.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.320]   It's not that much on a monthly basis,
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.720]   not that much on an annual basis.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.680]   But compounded and invested over your lifetime,
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.280]   it's like, that can make a big difference.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.360]   And we're just talking about locally.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.420]   We're not even talking about, move to Vietnam,
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.200]   move to Thailand, where you can rent a place
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.560]   for 500,000 bucks.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.520]   - Right, exactly.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.760]   And by the way, there's a great website
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.920]   that you might enjoy and that listeners might enjoy
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.840]   called Savetaxesbymoving.com.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.800]   And you can put in there the state that you live in,
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.160]   and then you can pick a different state,
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.840]   anything that you are interested in,
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.320]   and you can calculate, okay,
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.100]   if I just simply moved from one state to another,
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.880]   still within the US, 'cause what happens is,
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.400]   everyone says, well, I have to move to Thailand.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.000]   Well, I don't wanna move to Thailand.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.200]   I wanna live in the United States.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.640]   But I might be willing to just change
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.400]   from one state to a bordering state.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.520]   And I just ran the math here.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.960]   5,000 bucks a year invested over 40 years,
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.880]   say from 25 to 65 at 10% annually,
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.000]   with just level 5,000 bucks,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.680]   comes out to be $2.4 million.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.640]   - Yeah, I think one of these recent years,
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.720]   we paid 10 grand to the state of California,
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.440]   just for the privilege of living here.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.120]   It's like, it hurts.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.320]   It's crazy to think about.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.120]   Oh my gosh, okay, so people don't move.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.440]   That was overlook deduction number one.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.480]   - All right, number two is,
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.700]   they don't, people don't pay attention
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.520]   to the little ways to align your activities
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.980]   in a way that are beneficial to you,
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.280]   to align your business activities
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.500]   in a way that are beneficial to you.
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.800]   Example here, let me give you an example
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.280]   of business travel.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.500]   Many times, I just got back from a conference
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.520]   last week in Dallas.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.040]   Now, this one for me, I needed to go there and get back.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.240]   So I just, I flew out there,
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.520]   and it was literally gone two nights,
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.040]   and it was just there and back.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.600]   There wasn't any fun associated with the conference for me.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.760]   It was pure work.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.880]   I worked if I wasn't sleeping, and that was it,
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.720]   and I got home.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.160]   And that was what I needed to do at this point.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.020]   But something like a conference
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.680]   can be a really great way, if you understand the law,
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.560]   can be a really great way for you to do business,
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.800]   but also have some of your expenses
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.440]   defrayed by the tax code.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.800]   So simple things like if you,
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.400]   let's say I had a conference on Thursday and Friday,
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.680]   and I had business meetings on Monday.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.880]   Well, under the tax code, I can stay through the weekend,
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.000]   and my weekend expenses are deductible
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.480]   as part of my business travel expenses.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.720]   Or if there's even a holiday,
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.660]   let's say there's a holiday where there's a Friday,
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.180]   if I have pre-scheduled appointments on Thursday and Monday,
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.680]   well now if I'm staying in a town,
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.880]   those now are business expenses.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.460]   Or one that I hope to use in the future is I like to drive.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.040]   And under the IRS rules,
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.800]   as long as I drive 300 miles in a day
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.560]   toward my business destination,
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.000]   'cause the IRS doesn't say how I get there.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.720]   They don't say I have to take the cheapest, fastest,
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.760]   they do say most direct,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   but I don't have to take the cheapest,
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.560]   fastest plane ticket I can find,
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.560]   fly in on the morning and fly out the day after,
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.680]   you know, the evening after to save on money.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.180]   I can choose to drive.
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.520]   So if I chose to drive to Texas,
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.900]   as long as I cover 300 miles in a day
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.440]   of driving on a direct route from my house
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.060]   to the business destination,
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.120]   now that's a deductible business day.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:52.120]   And so all of my travel expenses associated with that day
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.340]   are now deductible.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.000]   So little things like that.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.180]   There's no reason why I can't arrange my affairs
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.600]   to visit some friends along the way.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.460]   And then by understanding the number of days
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.900]   that are business versus the number of days
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:03.820]   that are personal,
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.900]   I can go ahead and slide in a couple of days
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.720]   of personal expenses in there.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.840]   They won't be deductible.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.060]   Personal expenses are simply not deductible,
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.320]   but I can defray some of the costs
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.380]   by including that in with business travel.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.620]   So little things like that,
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.460]   understanding the actual rules and figuring out
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.420]   how do I maximize,
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.480]   for example, if you have a side hustle business,
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.700]   and let's say that you're married and you have two cars,
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.080]   you wanna make sure that you try to drive
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.540]   both of those cars for business,
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.940]   deduct business miles 'cause you'll get more of a deduction
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.700]   for driving both cars than just putting it all on one car.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.140]   Some of the little ideas and the little math tricks
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.460]   are really helpful and add up over time.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.300]   - Okay.
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.200]   And so if you're meeting clients locally,
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.620]   your mileage to that meeting is deductible, I assume?
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.460]   - Right.
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.420]   As long as it's not commuting.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.100]   Commuting expenses are never deductible,
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.200]   but as long as I'm traveling from a place of business
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.820]   to a business appointment, then it's deductible.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:57.740]   And for someone like you,
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.700]   your place of business is probably your home office,
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.180]   then now all of your miles to go and visit clients,
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.300]   wherever that is, or potential business connections,
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.540]   those would now be deductible business miles.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.380]   - Right.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.020]   And I think we should make the important point,
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.820]   not to go out of your way to rack up expenses
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.540]   'cause it still costs you money.
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.020]   That doesn't make sense to spend money
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.980]   for the sake of spending money for the sake of a deduction,
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.260]   like you said, 100% tax bracket.
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.060]   'Cause we would meet people in the car business
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.660]   who would come in every December and be like,
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.740]   might as well buy a truck.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.340]   Like, okay, I mean, if you're gonna buy it anyways,
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.980]   I guess it makes sense, but we'll take the business.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.540]   Okay, so aligning your activities
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:41.220]   to kind of some business or beneficial activities.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.860]   Okay, what's number three?
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.620]   - Number three is understanding how to,
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.620]   probably understanding how to shift income
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.740]   would be an example that I would use.
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.100]   When you run your own business,
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.660]   then you have a little bit more flexibility
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.460]   with simple things like who works for you
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.780]   and when they work for you.
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.620]   So, there are some serious advantages, if you can,
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.020]   to hiring family members to work for you.
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.580]   So, you can hire your spouse and you can hire your kids.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.820]   And essentially what you can do is by shifting income
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.380]   from you to a spouse or to kids,
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.860]   you may be able to take advantage
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.740]   of a difference in tax brackets.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.060]   They may be earning at a lower tax bracket.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:20.540]   And then you can, that'll save you a lot of money.
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:24.260]   And that also can be beneficial to employ your spouse
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.360]   because, or to employ family,
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.160]   because if there are business expenses
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.340]   that are associated with your employees,
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.060]   those expenses are deductible.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.380]   Give me an example.
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.500]   If I go to a conference,
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.380]   I don't employ my wife in my business.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.340]   And the reason I don't is simply because
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.860]   she doesn't want to work in my business.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.860]   So, she's not open to this.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.660]   But if she wanted to work with me in my business
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.580]   and if she was able to actually be an employee,
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.580]   and that's very important that you have careful records,
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:52.500]   that she's doing work.
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.180]   This is not the kind of thing where,
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.540]   oh, I'm just writing her checks
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.220]   and we'll just call this wages.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.960]   No, she needs to be actually working.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.380]   But for many people, they like working with their spouses.
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.020]   Well, if my spouse is employed in my business,
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.780]   that can be helpful in multiple ways,
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.260]   including the fact that now we can travel together
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.180]   to a conference, we can travel together to business events,
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.580]   and now our expenses for both of our travel
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.700]   are fully deductible.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.500]   Because if she's not an employee in my business,
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.420]   then the only expenses that are deductible are my expenses.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.900]   So, something as simple as that of hiring a spouse,
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:25.740]   that can be a big one.
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.260]   Hiring kids can be really, really valuable.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.020]   You know, the joke is, if you want to pay
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.980]   for your kid's college with deductible expenses,
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.340]   hire them to work in your business.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:34.580]   - Yeah, yeah, no, I've heard this.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.180]   And this is a fascinating one to me.
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.780]   Like, so, I had a friend, you know,
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.460]   this was several years ago, working in real estate.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:44.180]   And so, like, his kids would pass out flyers
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:48.180]   or they would, like, you know, model for,
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.340]   like, really random, so they would model for his,
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.300]   like, advertisement flyers or something,
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:57.180]   or like, oh my gosh, remember on Smart Passive Income
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.020]   where Pat had Keone read, like, say smart, smart,
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.180]   say passive, passive.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.300]   Do you think he was paying him?
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.980]   Like, that would be, do you think he was, like,
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.820]   that was like, okay, now he's a podcast co-host.
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.220]   - So, it's an interesting question.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:14.540]   One of the things that you want to be careful,
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.140]   it's great to be inspired by friends who have examples,
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.980]   but the problem is you don't actually know
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.940]   if those friends, A, know what they're talking about,
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.620]   and you don't know if what they've been doing
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.400]   has been tested by an audit.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.700]   So, ask your friend, have you been audited
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:27.700]   and has this held up?
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.700]   And if so, you know, give a little bit more weight
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.300]   to what they've done.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.580]   The key with any kind of expense is that
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.860]   you want to make sure that whatever expense
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.540]   that you're paying is a market rate.
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.260]   The IRS has no predetermined, that I'm aware of,
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.260]   there's no predetermined amount
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.980]   that you could actually pay somebody,
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.780]   or no predetermined, you know, number.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.020]   For example, this is what's frustrating
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.100]   to so many people when they establish an S corporation
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.020]   with the goal of lowering their self-employment taxes.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.180]   Then they say, well, how much should be wages
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.660]   and how much should be dividends?
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.180]   The only answer is the amount of wages,
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.260]   it should be wages, is the amount that should be wages
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.820]   is the amount that you would have to pay somebody
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.580]   to do that work in your area.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.580]   And so, one of the keys of making yourself audit-proof
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:14.020]   is doing good research and recording it.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.600]   So, if you were passing, if I hired my kids
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.860]   to pass out flyers and that was their goal,
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.660]   then what I would wanna do is I would wanna see
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.820]   what can I hire somebody in my local area
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.420]   to pass out flyers for?
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.260]   And I'd like to, it'd be good to have some way
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.900]   of externally verifying that.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.820]   It's probably not $50 an hour,
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.780]   but it might be nine or it might be 10.
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.060]   So, let's say it's 10.
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.300]   Now, that can be a real benefit
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.860]   'cause I can pay my kids $10 an hour,
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.780]   whatever the market wage is for that.
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.940]   But, if I'm paying them $50 an hour
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.740]   and the market wage is 10,
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.220]   then that is certainly gonna be disallowed.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.060]   So, what, so the question,
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.020]   if I'm hiring my kids to model for me,
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.540]   what would I need to hire somebody,
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.380]   what would I need to pay somebody to model?
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.280]   And so, there's no reason not to pursue it.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.780]   You call a local modeling agency
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.620]   and you get a couple of quotes and you say,
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.700]   I need some child models, here's the event,
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.700]   they're gonna be performing in this video,
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.260]   they're gonna be taking these pictures,
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.540]   what would be the fees?
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.740]   And then, if you go ahead and you track that,
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.460]   and I would put that into my records for the year
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.180]   and make sure that I had that information,
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.940]   then that would be a reasonable fee
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.240]   to pay to your kids for their modeling efforts.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.260]   So, you can do it, you just gotta do it carefully
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.500]   and do it right and substantiate your research.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.700]   - Yeah, I really like that one,
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.500]   then funneling that into some investment account
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.180]   for their education, that's cool.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.980]   - Right, and there'd be multiple ways of doing it.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.420]   So, for example, people often talk,
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.380]   and you can do this, you can set up a Roth IRA
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.380]   for your kids, that's valuable.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.540]   The rules with establishing retirement accounts
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.980]   are all based upon earned income.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.620]   So, let's assume I hire my son
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.220]   and he earns $3,000 working for me
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.160]   over the course of his summer vacation.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.860]   What I can do is I can pay him $3,000
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.940]   and then I can go ahead and gift him $3,000.
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.420]   And what we do is all of his earned income,
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.300]   the $3,000, can go into a Roth IRA,
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.100]   and then he can go ahead and spend the $3,000
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.500]   that I gave him for his personal expenses.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.220]   That's a way of me getting money into a Roth IRA
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.600]   for my 13-year-old son, if I had a 13-year-old son.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.900]   Or if I have a 19-year-old son
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.220]   and the tuition bill is $10,000
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.420]   and I wanna deduct that $10,000,
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.300]   I can go ahead and hire him, he can work for me
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.340]   enough time to earn $10,000.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.820]   Now I've deducted the $10,000 of wages that I'm paying him
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.580]   and I can go ahead and give him the money for school.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.620]   Now I've deducted, in essence, the school expenses.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.620]   - That's genius.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.820]   - He's still gotta work, so they gotta earn it.
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:29.940]   So it's good on both accounts.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.020]   It's good on taxes and it's good on character.
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.220]   - Absolutely, no, and that's really cool.
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.740]   One of the, I mean, we could geek out on this stuff
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:40.580]   for a long time, but one of my favorite things is,
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.340]   especially when it was full side hustle income for me,
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.140]   when I still had the day job and everything,
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.740]   one of my favorite things was to funnel
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.220]   almost all of that money into investment accounts,
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.300]   into retirement accounts,
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.260]   'cause I didn't need it to live off of.
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:00.980]   It was, and with the S-Corp rules or something,
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:05.340]   you can invest 25% of your compensation, I think.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:07.340]   And so just straight into that.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.220]   And then what's also cool is you can, a company match.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.260]   So I have a company match, one to one,
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.500]   up to whatever the limit is.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.660]   And so that's gonna be a business deduction as well,
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.660]   and for the retirement account.
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.140]   - Right, I mean, in the right situation,
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.340]   and this is, what's frustrating to people
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.420]   when they hear advice like this is that it's all
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.420]   gotta be personally customized based upon
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.780]   what benefits do you have at work,
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.220]   what benefits do you not have.
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.660]   For example, if somebody's covered by an employer plan,
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.580]   a qualified plan such as a 401(k), that makes a difference.
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:42.040]   But in essence, you can set up, and with a side hustle,
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.340]   the rules on retirement contributions
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.860]   are all based upon earned income.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.740]   So if you have a side hustle that's earning,
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.780]   let's say 50,000 bucks, what you probably did
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.860]   was a SEP IRA, and there you're limited to 25%
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.940]   of your income into that account.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.340]   But if you set up something like a solo 401(k),
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.440]   and if we write the documents correctly,
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.800]   you could in essence wipe out 50,000 bucks of profit
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.340]   right into a solo 401(k) in your own business.
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.180]   And with the right entity, I could set up
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.300]   a defined benefit plan.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.940]   If you have a C corporation, and we can do what,
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.660]   just sound fancy tax sounding words,
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.300]   but you can set up a non-qualified
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.100]   deferred compensation program.
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.860]   And there are ways that we can get 'em set up
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.220]   where we could get $200,000 a year
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.340]   of contributions into the accounts.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.140]   It's complicated, it's not necessarily easy.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.820]   The SEP IRA is gonna be very simple,
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.700]   a solo 401(k) is pretty simple.
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.960]   But there's no reason why you shouldn't be,
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.800]   if you wanna fund retirement accounts,
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.960]   there's no reason why you shouldn't build up
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.620]   and use some of that external income
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.300]   and use that money to fund those accounts.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.140]   - I like it, Joshua.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.160]   If there's, here's a question for you.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.400]   Because a few years ago I was interviewing
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.920]   different accountants or CPAs,
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.760]   and eventually settled on one,
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.240]   but didn't end up seeing a ton of value from it.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.160]   Like I still had to provide all the numbers,
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.180]   which I expected, but there wasn't much going on
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:10.260]   in terms of consultation or tax savings
[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.160]   or kind of strategies, conversations along those lines.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.000]   It was like, I'm just gonna punch these numbers
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.360]   into my form for you.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.080]   Like, well I can do that myself,
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.480]   if that's all you're gonna do.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.160]   And so that's what I've been doing ever since.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.440]   So do you have any tips,
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.980]   and this could be a shameless plug as well,
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.280]   like for finding somebody who's worth it?
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.520]   And I kicked the idea around on Twitter.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.680]   Like the performance-based accountant,
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.080]   that's all I want.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.480]   If I, you know, take a percentage of what you save me.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.040]   Like that's what I'm looking for,
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.600]   but I guess that's against some sort of guidelines and stuff.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.520]   - Yeah, that's actually one of my backup plans
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.800]   that I would love to do.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.040]   And I'm not an accountant, actually.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.160]   In fact, I'm completely unqualified to give tax advice
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.600]   from the technical perspective of,
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.000]   I don't have a CPA license, and I'm not an enrolled agent.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.520]   I am a certified financial planner.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.440]   So that does give me some,
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.680]   I think I do have professional responsibility
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:02.280]   in that case, but like I'm not an accountant.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.040]   And the reason I have studied this stuff
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.360]   and know a good bit about it
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.440]   is because I had the same frustration that you had.
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.440]   Is I found one good accountant that was a friend of mine
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.840]   and he helped me out tremendously,
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.880]   but then he left the area
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.920]   and I've never been able to find another good one
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.040]   who was able to do a lot of proactive planning.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.480]   And so what I would say is that you've gotta shop
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.040]   and shop for someone that can help.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.320]   But the key is don't shop at tax time.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.840]   So the time to go to your accountant and ask for advice
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.840]   is not March, it's not April.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.040]   It is probably not February,
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.840]   although February is when you should be doing planning.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.520]   If you wanna get them while they're able to,
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.320]   they'll talk to you, it's probably January
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.240]   and yeah, very early February.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.520]   But the key is that as we record this, it's February 17.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.480]   This is the time to be doing planning for 2015.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.280]   Not for 2014.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.720]   2014 is done.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.480]   There are a couple of tiny tricks that can be done,
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.200]   but pretty much, which by the way, I have a show on that,
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.040]   that is last minute tax planning strategies
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.000]   that can be done.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.320]   But even that was a December show.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.360]   But there are only a very small number of things
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.560]   that can be done in April.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.120]   So shop for an accountant in February or January
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.320]   and be willing to pay an offer
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.800]   just simply for an hourly rate and a consultation.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.120]   The trick is to understand what your accountant is doing
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.120]   that is getting paid.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.480]   And so usually an accountant is being paid
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.440]   for the preparation of tax returns.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.000]   And so if you want them to not be focused
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.880]   on the preparation for tax returns,
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.840]   you need to pay a consulting fee
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.720]   and offer two, 300 bucks in advance
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.880]   and say I don't want a return,
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:40.200]   I want you to sit down and look at my situation.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.760]   And in that situation, you need to be prepared
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.880]   with good data so that they can talk you through
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.080]   and help you with actual answers.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.920]   - Okay, I mean do you just go to Yelp
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.400]   and say who's a high rated accountant in my area?
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.880]   Or do you kind of, is there, is there any other--
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.000]   - I have no idea.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.840]   - Check it out.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.120]   - Yeah, I have no idea.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.880]   This is pretty, would be very business specific.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.880]   So for example, if I were a real estate investor,
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.200]   I would want to make sure that my accountant
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.400]   were only practicing with real estate clients.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.000]   Needs to be state specific
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.820]   because different businesses are very different.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.520]   Let's say as a side hustler,
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.520]   it would be unusual that you would have
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.880]   large capital expenses, you know,
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.520]   that you're spending $3 million or $4 million per year
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.120]   on plant and equipment.
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:26.280]   So that would be a different type of accounting structure.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.160]   You would want someone who's very familiar with that.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.840]   You would want someone who's up and knows how to sit down
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.120]   and do a cost segregation study and figure out,
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.360]   okay, of this plant and equipment,
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.240]   what's, how quickly can I amortize these expenses
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.200]   versus the others?
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.480]   That's very different than a side hustler
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.080]   who's working from a spare bedroom
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.080]   building up an internet business or something like that.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.020]   So I simply don't have a good answer.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.920]   It's one of my backup business plans at some point
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.280]   if I can make the time.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.000]   Maybe I'll start a tax firm of accountants
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   that only exclusively do consultations
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.280]   'cause I've never been able to find one
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.240]   that would help me with that.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.240]   - Yeah, and it seems like that's the fun part of the business
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.880]   trying to help people save money.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.440]   - It is, but it's hard.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.280]   Here's the problem.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.440]   - Free business idea for anyone listening.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.560]   - I mean, if I came up to you
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.200]   and let's say I found $50,000 worth of savings,
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.500]   are you ready to pull out a checkbook
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.500]   and write me a check for 25 grand?
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:16.340]   That's the challenge,
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.800]   and I'm sure that's why most people don't do it.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:18.760]   I've never tried to ask people
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.440]   for that $25,000 check for that service,
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.840]   but I would love to do it.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.120]   I'm just not sure that people wouldn't chicken out
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.380]   at the end when they're ready to write the check
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.520]   for what I saved them.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.800]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:30.760]   You just doubled your money.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.580]   I don't know.
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.420]   That seems like a no-brainer,
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.520]   but it's a big check to write.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.520]   Joshua, thanks so much, everyone.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.760]   It's RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.840]   Awesome podcast over there.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.800]   Check it out.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.120]   Joshua, we'll wrap up with your number one tip
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.680]   for Side Hustle Nation.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.960]   - Number one tip is this.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.960]   Calculate your actual income
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.520]   and your actual expenses.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.920]   The biggest mistake I've seen in the years
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.960]   I've been doing financial planning
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.260]   is that nobody knows what their actual income
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.160]   and what their actual expenses are.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   By actual income, I mean start with your gross income.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.680]   Don't start with what you see on your paycheck.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.520]   Start with your pre-paycheck number,
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.420]   and then calculate out that number,
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:05.880]   including what you pay in tax.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.600]   In the years that I've been asking people
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.360]   and simply saying, "How much did you pay last year in tax?"
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.760]   I have yet to find someone who knows that number.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.400]   So when I ask, "Dear Mr. Client or Ms. Client,
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.960]   "how much did you pay last year in tax?"
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.360]   usually the answer I get is, "Oh, I got a refund."
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.400]   No, that's not the question.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.760]   How much did you pay?
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.000]   And so here's how this can be impactful.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.320]   If you actually do it,
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.980]   and you actually know those numbers,
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.160]   then what you can figure out is
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.580]   what's the cost of working versus doing something else?
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.640]   So many people in your Side Hustle Nation
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.880]   will be married, and one spouse is pursuing something.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.960]   So I've prepared an example here.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.320]   I'll just run you through,
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.600]   and this is a real life type of example
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.320]   of what I've seen time after time
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.920]   of listeners of my show have written back and said,
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.760]   "This helped."
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.120]   So let's say that you have two spouses.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.800]   One is earning 80,000 bucks,
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.400]   and the other is earning 40,000 bucks.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.600]   And both of them are employed outside the house.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.120]   Both of them are earning wages.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.640]   Well, if you take $40,000 of gross wages,
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.920]   and you pull out 7.65%, that's the employment taxes,
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.720]   that's Medicare and Social Security,
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.960]   that loses you $3,060 of employment taxes.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.200]   Then assume that you have, at that rate,
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.040]   let's assume that you have a marginal effective tax rate,
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.280]   including your federal, state, and local taxes,
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.920]   if you have 'em, of 20%.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.560]   That's a pretty conservative number.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.440]   There you're out 8,000 bucks.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.720]   So now we're up to $11,060 of missing income
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:24.600]   solely due to tax.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.960]   So you went from $40,000 down to under $30,000 just for tax.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.880]   Now the big one is then calculate the cost of working.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.520]   So for many families, let's say you have a two-parent
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.480]   household with kids, many families, that includes daycare.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.780]   So assume 1,000 bucks a month, $250 a week for daycare.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.100]   Now you lose $12,000 for daycare.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:46.040]   Then calculate all of the other job-related expenses.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.800]   Do you drive to work or does that cause you to need
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.000]   to keep two cars instead of being fine with one?
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.200]   Or do you pay for workday meals out?
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.040]   Or the big one is just what my wife and I,
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.860]   when both of us worked outside the house,
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.020]   was we found a lot of times we'd just eat out at night
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.460]   'cause we were too busy to make something
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.400]   and we were too tired.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.760]   Or do you have work closed?
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.680]   So if you pull out something like $300 a month
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.880]   of extra gas costs or insurance costs
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.440]   of maintaining a second car,
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.100]   $100 a month of having extra food expenses,
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.820]   whether that's lunches or dinners that you have to buy
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.020]   instead of make, and maybe, I don't know,
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.220]   50 bucks a month for fancy work clothes,
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:23.740]   what you wind up with is $40,000 minus $3,000
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.980]   of employment taxes minus $8,000 of income taxes
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:31.440]   minus $12,000 of daycare minus $3,600 of vehicle costs
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.940]   minus $1,200 of extra food minus $600 of work food,
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.460]   and you're left with $11,540 of net profit.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.140]   - That's your net profit from your job.
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:40.980]   - That's your net profit from your job.
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:41.800]   - Which is so sad.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.240]   And that's why people end up not going back to work
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.380]   'cause it's more expensive to pay for daycare.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.380]   - Exactly.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.940]   And then divide that into the number of hours
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:53.220]   you're actually working, meaning being at work,
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:54.680]   commuting to and from work,
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.540]   answering emails from home, et cetera.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.460]   And assume that you're doing that only 50 hours a week,
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.180]   which is probably low for many people
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.620]   by the time you include commuting time,
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:03.020]   especially in California.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.700]   If it's 2,500 hours a year that you're actually working,
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.740]   your net pay is $4.62 an hour,
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:12.260]   and you have no benefits from the tax code
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.380]   for being an employee, period.
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:17.100]   So if you did nothing else as a result of this show,
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.700]   sit down and calculate those numbers.
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:20.340]   I had a listener call my show last week.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.220]   He sat down and did this over a period of time,
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:23.520]   did his financial statements
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.060]   the way that I teach people to do it.
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:28.180]   He said, "My wife," he called me,
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:30.020]   "It was his wife's last day of work,
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:34.940]   "and they're saving $30,000 per year for her not working
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.080]   "with the tax benefits that I taught them about,
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.440]   "with the costs of working.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.460]   "They're saving $30,000 for her not working."
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.180]   And it's remarkable when you look at the numbers.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.380]   Now, everyone's individual numbers will change.
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.820]   That's just a made-up example.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.620]   But if you actually look at your numbers,
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.820]   you can coach yourself through to whatever you desire.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.180]   - That's really eye-opening, I think,
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:57.580]   at least it can be for a lot of people.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.380]   It's like, well, what could I do elsewhere
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.620]   to make more than $4 an hour,
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:06.740]   or to make back this and probably have more fun doing it?
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.260]   So, awesome stuff.
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.900]   Joshua, thank you so much for enlightening us.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.580]   I know I've got some homework to do.
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:14.460]   We'll put all of this stuff together
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:15.300]   in the show notes for you,
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.440]   and a little cheat sheet as well.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.420]   So, thanks so much.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.700]   We'll talk to you soon.
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.100]   - Thanks for having me, Nick.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.620]   - All right, hopefully that show sparked some ideas
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:28.100]   on how your side hustle can save you money come tax time.
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.500]   Now let's go and get those returns wrapped up
