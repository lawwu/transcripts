[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   Welcome everybody to episode 101. David Sacks is on vacation sitting in Brad Gershner from Altimeter
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.000]   Group. Welcome back to the pod. Brad, how you doing? Good to be back. Good to be back. I mean,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.440]   first you first you guys, you know, tilted Friedberg and now a little bit on Sacks is
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.760]   getting attacked on Twitter. And so you roll me back in when you got a little problem. Whenever
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.760]   the Brigadoons come out, Brad Gershner comes. I think Sacks will be okay. But shout out to Sacks.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.920]   You know who probably hates the term Brigadoons? The nitwits that are in the Brigadoons.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.120]   Oh, the Brigadoons. It's all going to end at some point because I think the Brigadoons. New
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.840]   ownership at Twitter is going to change like the whole spam thing. That's a Rodgers and Hammerstein
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.040]   musical, right? Brigadoon? Brigadoon, yeah. Yeah. But now I think Brigadoons could stick. I don't,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.480]   I've never heard anybody use that for the Burbators. Yeah, calling the Twitter mob
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.280]   the Brigadoons is a good new thing. I like that. Yeah, it's pejorative. It's funny. It'll,
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.780]   everything a little bit tones it down. I like it. It feels
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.500]   goofy. It completely disempowers them. They really
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.680]   want to be taken seriously but they're just a brigadoon. BRIG
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.880]   a dune. I mean, to be a brigadoon though, you have to
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.040]   have four or more accounts and you have to reply to each of
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.060]   those accounts as if it's an actual conversation. JJ, can
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.480]   you a solo brigadoon? Yeah, when you re-tweet something as a
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.160]   social justice warrior as an example, you're trying to join
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.640]   the brigadoon. Ah, got it. It's just a different brigadoon.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.060]   It's a brigadoon. Jekyll, are you sometimes a brigadoon,
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.000]   right? You're part of brigadoons, Jekyll. No, I'm not
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   part of any brigadoon. You're totally brigadoon, come on. I do
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.620]   not, no. Brigadoon. I never, I've never brigadone. I've never
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.100]   brigadone. I mean, I may have brigadone once or twice for my
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.780]   burner account but that's it. I mean,
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.600]   Rain Man David Sack
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.900]   and it said we open source it to the fans and they've just
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.260]   gone crazy with it. Love you, Wes. Nice queen of quinoa.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.340]   Well, anyway, Kanye West can't leave an amazing career alone
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.180]   and he is going to buy Parler which apparently Candace Owens
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.060]   husband, George Farmer, had created. So, he's gonna buy his
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.260]   own social network. If you don't remember Parler is like a
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.060]   really shitty version of Twitter that never seems to have worked
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.700]   or been stable. It crashed the first 10 times I used it.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.980]   Miraculously, this steaming pile of garbage had raised 56
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.220]   million in funding and Kanye is on a social media slash media
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.860]   tour saying horrific anti-Semitic stuff. He seems to
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.460]   be having a mental breakdown again. Uh there's a big
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.820]   discussion now I guess. Should people be platforming them to
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.420]   the point that he's doing three, four, 5 hour interviews
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.220]   with people and it does seem like it's acute mental illness
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.980]   slash breakdown. I don't wanna like diagnose anybody from afar
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.100]   here and I'm not qualified. But you just did. Well, I mean, he
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.060]   has been public about his struggles with mental illness.
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.700]   It's not a huge leap for any of us that have had family
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.420]   members. Yes. Manic episodes. I mean, this is clearly a manic.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.060]   It's pretty much right out of the textbook. So, my question
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.820]   for you guys is what you have somebody with great wealth,
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.700]   great creativity. He's obviously a savant in so many
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.700]   different categories with a huge social media following plus
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.460]   money, plus fame, and then you add social media to the mix
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.740]   which is an accelerant and then all of these, you know, Tucker
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.380]   Coulson and every other publication, every podcast
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.500]   using this moment. I think in a way to kind of, I don't know,
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.540]   get ratings off of this train wreck. I find it abhorrent to
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.700]   interview somebody when they're in a manic episode like this.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.340]   I'll be totally honest. I wouldn't do it. What is your
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.220]   take on this? I have a family member, a blood relative that
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.900]   is in severe mental health crisis. If the emails and the
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:15.420]   text messages that this person sent were public, you you I
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.700]   read these things and they've severely severely impacted me
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.500]   to the point now where I have like a rule that when they're
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.780]   in a manic episode, I just kind of harvest them and archive
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.100]   them just in case something bad happens but I can't even take
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.220]   the effort to read it and because it takes such a toll and
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.660]   then I feel really guilty because I think maybe there's a
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.660]   something in there where I could be missing something. So,
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.580]   this is what when you're in the middle of a of of a severe
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.220]   episode, this is what the family and the loved ones of
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.740]   that person is also dealing with. So, I have I have no idea
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.780]   what's happening with Kanye but what I would tell you is when
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.420]   you're in a manic episode, the more the the thing that you
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.660]   need is for the people around you to try to step in to help
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.260]   you and it's really freaking hard and I can tell you that in
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.860]   in I've seen this person in my family say and say things and
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.020]   do things that are just so beyond the pale. Yeah. And it's
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.940]   part of when they're in that moment and the whole goal is to
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.580]   try to get them out. Get them back on their meds. Get them
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.700]   rebalanced. It's a really really complicated thing to deal
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.140]   with. Well, look, I mean, the guy, the guy's buying a social
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:32.380]   media platform. I think it continues to support the point
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.380]   that I've made a few times which is I don't think that
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.700]   anyone has a monopoly in social media networks. We've seen
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.220]   every couple of years, competitors emerge, people
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.860]   proclaim monopoly, those monopolies get destroyed by the
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.460]   next thing, you know, from Friendster to Myspace to
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.060]   Facebook to Instagram to Snapchat to TikTok and I think
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.420]   that the the reality is the users of those platforms
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.780]   ultimately coalesce around a set of standards they want to
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.980]   see happen on that platform and those standards become kind of
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.620]   the editorialized or produced model for how that platform
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.180]   should operate because that's what the users say. They don't
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.060]   want antisemitism. They don't want what they would call kind
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.700]   of challenging an institution. They don't want fake news,
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.340]   whatever the the classification is. There's an
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.860]   editor or an editorial board that editorializes what is and
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.420]   isn't allowed to be said on that platform and ultimately
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.940]   there is a fringe voice or a voice that feels unheard or
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.980]   feels like it cannot speak on that platform and what we're
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.420]   seeing now with I think Elon acquiring Twitter and Kanye
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.340]   acquiring Parler and generally a number of kind of emerging
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.260]   networks like what's it called Rumbler as an alternative to
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.940]   YouTube. It's a really clear indication. What's it called?
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.500]   Rumble, I think. Rumble. Yeah. No, I think it's a really clear
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.100]   supporting fact that there are going to be alternatives and
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.580]   that these what we thought were monopolies and what kind of
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.500]   became digital town squares and almost infrastructure are
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.140]   really just application layers. They're editorialized and
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.220]   there are going to be competitors and I think there
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.140]   are folks that want to have a voice that feel like they've
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.900]   been editorialized out of the existing networks like Kanye,
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.100]   like Trump, like Elon to some degree and they're you know
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.500]   those that have resources are changing that and I think that
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.780]   speaks to a really healthy competitive market. So having
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.900]   folks like Kanye step in and try and create a new platform
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.500]   that has alternative voices long term. I believe in freedom
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.740]   of speech. I believe that we should have alternative voices,
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.380]   but I also believe that consumers and customers should
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.500]   be able to choose what platform they want to be on based on the
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.740]   editorialization that happens on those platforms and I do
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.380]   believe that the owners of those platforms should have their
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.380]   own rules because it creates a different differentiated
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.420]   product. Jason is that what you were hoping to get comment on
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.660]   or this idea of the media outing frenzy feeding on Kanye's
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.860]   mental breakdown. Yeah, I was talking about the media frenzy.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.180]   That's the thing that I think is pretty apparent here. In
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.580]   fact, YouTube just pulled a bunch of the interviews he did
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.740]   recently because there's so much anti semitic stuff in it
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.420]   and you know when somebody's in a mental breakdown like this,
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.820]   which I think it's pretty clear he's in you know they do this
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.220]   behavior and of course it's hurting them. It's to your
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.820]   point. You know I'm sure it's hurting his kids or or ex
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:20.780]   wives or ex wife and you know can I ask that it's going to
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.740]   blow back. What's that can I ask who do you think is to
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.780]   decide that because he's done interviews where he said I have
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.180]   episodes and those episodes actually provide me with
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.340]   creativity and brilliance. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's up to
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.700]   the person the person who is the host of that show who has
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.500]   to make an editorial decision and so Tucker Carlson's going
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.820]   for ratings or if somebody else does it and they want the
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.500]   ratings because Kanye's a big name. That's you know I get it.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.900]   He's a he's a great get right and if you're somebody who
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.380]   likes to interview people, that's like a lifetime get that
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.780]   could be the get that you know makes people learn about your
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.860]   podcast. I just think it's unethical to do that when
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.180]   somebody is suffering like that to then feature them and to
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.300]   platform them in order to get your own ratings. That's a
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.740]   personal decision. I mean, I would never do it. Let me ask
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.300]   you a different question though. So I wouldn't do it.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.540]   Would you hold him accountable for what he said? Well, this
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.380]   and this is the nuance you know and I think we do have to think
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:18.620]   about that because anti semitism exists in the world. He's got a
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.900]   big fan base. That means if he's got people in his fan base who
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.940]   are also having a manic episode, they could then be
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.660]   inspired by what he's saying to do something horrific and
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.740]   cause real world harm and and this is where you know the
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.220]   accelerant of social media I think is particularly dangerous
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.020]   to him off you know in the old days if somebody said this
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.660]   stuff on a talk show, maybe they don't air it where they say
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.300]   it. It's in the newspapers, but when he can have a continuing
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.860]   dialogue across many podcasts a week, he's done like 10
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.740]   podcasts in the last week. He'll go on air with anybody
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.620]   and then he has whatever 10s of millions of followers. He's
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.260]   reaching hundreds of millions of people. All you need is one
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.620]   person who's mentally ill to then go do some horrible thing
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.860]   in the world that we've seen happen many times and that's
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.700]   what I'm concerned about. You have to understand your it's the
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.100]   law of big numbers. Basically tomorrow, there's a large number
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.420]   of people. Yeah, just to give you a sense of it. You know when
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.380]   this family member of mine, you know we've had we've had to have
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:18.380]   interventions. We've had police. We've had the government
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.260]   get involved in Canada. We had had their driver's license
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.140]   taken away then. I mean it is an unbelievably complicated set
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:35.660]   of interventions and I am so thankful that she doesn't have
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:44.940]   massive social media awareness because it would just be chaos
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.180]   and I would hate that you know because of their association to
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.740]   me that this person gets more attention than they should in a
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.820]   moment where what they really need is help and I think that
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.620]   that it should be the governing principle in moments like this
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.100]   where if a bunch of your family members or your healthcare
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.220]   providers or whatever can raise their hand and say, hey, hold on
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.420]   a second. This is completely off the rails. You know, free
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.860]   Burke to your point. I don't think that editorial freedom
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.500]   matters in that point. I think there's just a more humane idea
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.980]   around get this person off the airwaves and like allow
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:22.060]   themselves to get out of that loop settle down. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.980]   And and typically what happens is that you know these folks at
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.300]   Lee again and just in my experience will have titrated a
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.060]   medicine well and then when that titration fails their
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.740]   ability to regulate their emotions fail and this is the
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.020]   loop that they enter and you know you really have to find a
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.700]   way of like taking all of these mechanisms off the table so
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.540]   that they can re regulate themselves and I think that as a
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.060]   society we have to sort of move towards that so that if you
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.180]   know family members can call Twitter or Facebook or
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.220]   Instagram or whatever and say listen you're the doctor you
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.860]   know here's a here's the doctor's note like you have to
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.300]   be able to shut this stuff down because you have to mute all of
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.060]   these other things so that this person can then get back into a
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.380]   mode where they re regulate that should be the priority. Yeah.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.260]   Compassion for the person. Yeah. It's and it's not
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.180]   forgiving what they say but it is having maybe a little bit
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.060]   more compassion in that moment to get them back to their to
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.700]   their true self. I think this one's a little easy to say,
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.860]   hey, Kanye's having a mental breakdown because he's talked
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.100]   about mental illness in the past. It's a lot harder to make
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.940]   these you know, supposed determinations as a reporter or
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.300]   a podcast host. If someone says something crazy and then it's
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.380]   easy to raise your hand and say, hey, they're crazy. Cut it
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.340]   out or there's some mental health issue going on here. But
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.900]   Freeberg, if he's not, if he's not having a mental issue right
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.540]   now, then he is a horrible human being who is an anti-Semite
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.460]   who is spreading just the most vitriolic, horrible things you
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.540]   and tropes you could ever imagine at a time when you know
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.540]   there's enough division in the country and somebody could get
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:03.420]   hurt, you know. Uh so, either in either case, his accounts have
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.100]   to get paused if he's going to say anti-Semitic stuff on them.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.340]   I mean, that's that I mean, there's there's really clear
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.740]   guidelines across all these platforms on what's
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.620]   inappropriate and certainly, I think folks will start to adhere
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.180]   to it. I guess if I had anything to contribute, I mean, I
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.980]   think Chumas said this well about a mental health angle but
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.300]   what I would say is I actually think that the social platforms
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.660]   have done a reasonably good job. The fact that he's buying
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.460]   Parler, I think is evidence of the fact that there actually is
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.060]   an editorial layer. Yeah. That's doing a reasonable job.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.380]   It's a tough decision. There's always going to be a long tail
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.740]   of podcast. Somebody will, you know, somebody will go grift
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.300]   off of uh you know, an episode or whatever but I think, you
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.780]   know, a few years ago, we were talking about no editorial
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.300]   standards and I think today, you know, across these
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.500]   platforms, obviously, there's a tension. There's a tension
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.980]   that's existed for 100 years plus around free speech on
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.580]   these platforms. I get that tension but I think uh a little
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.260]   credit where credits do. We're seeing, we're not seeing these
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.740]   memes spread like wildfire uh in part because the platforms
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.460]   with the most reach are doing their job. Snaps down 30% today.
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.340]   Do you guys see this? I think it's it's related in the sense
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.700]   that everyone historically talked about social networks as
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.820]   being these uh you know, the network effect where you know,
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.900]   multiple people get on and they link up with you with each
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.580]   other. It's harder and harder to break the network and it
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.260]   gets bigger and more valuable and can generate more revenue.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.060]   Clearly not happened over the years with Twitter uh to the
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.620]   degree that people thought it should have and now clearly it's
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.420]   not happening with Snap. I think it also speaks to this
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.340]   idea of fragmentation. I don't know if you guys want to talk
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.100]   about Snap but pretty significant decline from well
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.900]   here's the here's the sixty. There were 160 billion market
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.740]   cap and today they're trading at twelve. They're down 91%
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.340]   from peak to track. 91%. Yeah. Here's the important thing to
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:03.660]   note which is that if you look at the MAU growth of Snap, it's
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.740]   actually been extremely steady and they've had an incredible
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.260]   march forward and I think that they're roughly around 350
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.860]   million. Um Nick, I'll send you the. Yeah, you. Right. I'll send
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.740]   you the link. Yeah, I think it's like the Dow is. You count is
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.460]   is incredible. It's incredible. It's amazing. So, it's like
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:25.020]   yeah, it's a service that is incrementally everyday more
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.300]   relied upon than the day before and it's a service that's
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.620]   providing a set of features that is incrementally more
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.300]   important to a larger and larger group of people. So, how
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.540]   do you then square that with its stock performance and in my
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.860]   opinion, I'll just be really honest with you and I don't
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.300]   know Evan Spiegel and I've never trafficked in Snapchat at
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:52.380]   all, okay? But it is the most glaring example of corporate
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.060]   misgovernance that has ever happened on the internet and
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.940]   the reason is when you look at what happened in the IPO, it
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:05.180]   basically created a governance structure where the common
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:10.540]   shareholder had all voting power taken away. So, 100%
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.740]   effectively, the de facto voting power stayed with the
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.980]   class that was held by the founders and so you you do not
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:23.180]   have a normal check and balance and it was egregious. Other
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.620]   companies would have voting programs where it was twenty to
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.340]   one and you would sometimes say, oh, it should only should
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.420]   be ten to one or it should be fifty to one. This was like 100
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:39.500]   to zero and what you have now is no real feedback loop
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.140]   because there is no person who can own enough equity with
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.860]   enough say to sit across the table from that CEO and say,
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.620]   here's what you're not seeing and here's what you're getting
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.620]   wrong and I think you're always better off by having those
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.860]   kinds of people be able to get a meeting with you in the first
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.300]   place and have a vested interest where you take them
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.020]   seriously but how would you receive a meeting when you're
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.180]   sitting across the table from somebody in the back of mind,
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.820]   you're like, wow, this person has literally no say in what I
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.500]   do after this meeting ends. Literally none. You can't vote
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.460]   even. Do you think it's different than alphabet and
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.780]   meta at ten to one? Cuz they I think they both have dual
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.140]   class, right? At ten to one voting. You actually. I think
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:34.300]   zero is in my opinion, a deep sign of disrespect. I think you
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:40.620]   can, I think you can agree, you know, that there is a
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.660]   separation between, you know, the voice of the common
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.140]   shareholder in these companies and and the direction of the
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.660]   companies but I think it obscures what's going on. I
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.380]   totally agree with you. If you look at usage, the number of
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.940]   customers walking into the store, snaps gone from 265 to
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:04.220]   360 million DAUs. Twitter, 190 to 240. Meta from 1.8 to two
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.380]   over the course of the last 3 years. They're all growing.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.540]   More people are walking into the store and using the
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.980]   service. The story here is all about pricing. How much is each
[00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.860]   of those users worth? I mean, Apple is the apex predator of
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.300]   this entire market. We wouldn't be having this conversation
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.860]   but for the fact that Apple's changes with IDFA literally
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.180]   pickpocketed the industry 2 billion dollars this year under
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:36.540]   the auspices of privacy and so if you look at these companies
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:42.780]   usage up, pricing or ARPU down. Okay. Recently, Apple's come
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.580]   under a bunch of pressure. So now they're out with SCAD 4
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:51.900]   which is their update to the the the ad policy post IDFA.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.900]   That allows you to target advertisers or individuals with
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.580]   10,000 attributes instead of 100 attributes. So we're going
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.940]   to see some realignment. I expect that the real question
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:07.180]   is what happens to ARPU next year but to me, the story here
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.860]   is that the usage and the health of these core platforms
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:15.100]   is remarkably sticky. Yeah. For all the things we say about
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.540]   Instagram, I mean, TikTok has had explosive growth, 30%
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.900]   growth each of the last 3 years but even the incumbent
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.500]   platforms, really sticky usage. This is about how they're
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.340]   monetizing those users and the real story is Apple. Yeah and
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.620]   if you for people who don't know IDFA is the identifier for
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.580]   advertisers. Some people refer to it as made mobile ID, ad ID.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.660]   I'm sorry and so what that does is it lets you track a user
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.100]   anonymously across. Have you ever have you ever owned and
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.380]   have you ever owned any clicks to a sale? Right. Have you ever
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:54.220]   owned Snapchat stock? No. Why not? Certainly, governance is a
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.580]   key component of it but the second thing is like do you
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.020]   have do you have any belief that you could even get a
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.100]   meeting with the CEO and management where they would
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:08.140]   listen to you appropriately? We've certainly got meetings
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.580]   with management before so yes, I believe we could whether or
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.700]   not that impacts you know how they build product, how they
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.060]   how they run the business, you know the influence, etcetera
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.700]   but again, I I think that's not really the problem here but the
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:27.260]   point I would totally agree with you on Chema. We've had 10
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:33.180]   years of where the cost of capital was zero. 10 years of
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.260]   hyper growth for these social networks, right? In each of the
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.700]   last five years, Facebook has hired more people in each of
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.140]   the last five years than they had 10 years after the company
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:49.180]   was founded, okay? So, as we've seen this growth begin to turn
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.780]   over, I have seen the companies really slow to react to
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.980]   right size their behavior that they had over the course of the
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.940]   last decade to put themselves in a position to compete for the
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.980]   next decade. So, it's one thing just to throw your hands in the
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.380]   air and say, well, this is all Apple. We couldn't do anything
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.540]   about it but we we really haven't seen leadership in
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.900]   terms of cost control. We really have. We all know these
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.460]   companies could run with you. Yeah. Of the of the major
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.260]   companies, Brad, Snap did do a 20% riff. They had 6000
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.700]   employees or so and they cut 20%. Facebook is the one that's
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.940]   perplexing because they seem to be massively over staffed as
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.380]   you talked about and they have been massively they've had a
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.580]   massive decline in their stock price and they are the one who
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.180]   is affected most by what Apple did in terms of app tracking
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:44.940]   transparency is I think that there's a perception though. I
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.420]   mean, I'm still stuck on this issue. I really think that
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:54.140]   stock prices tend to ebb and flow based on sort of like
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:59.020]   friction or momentum and when there's momentum, more and more
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.660]   people can easily underwrite it and when there's friction,
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.700]   fewer and fewer people can underwrite it and so, I think
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.340]   that if you are a CEO of a public company, you have to
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.300]   think about how many headwinds do I have and how many tailwinds
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.180]   do I have all the time and some of them are in your control and
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:19.420]   some of them are not at least in the case of meta as with
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:25.500]   Apple and Google, they meta is forced to copy the best
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.700]   decisions of these bigger companies. Why? Because they
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.100]   were one of those biggest. Now, they may have been the
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.620]   smallest of the biggest but it's going to be very hard for
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.780]   meta eventually to not converge on those same set of decisions
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:42.540]   and the most important one is what Brad just alluded to which
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.900]   is that there was a point in 2016 and 2017 where you
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.900]   literally could not give away Apple stock and the big turn of
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.660]   the dial and you know, some say it was Carl Icahn. Who knows
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.940]   was this theoretically this famous dinner that Carl Icahn
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.140]   had with Tim Cook where he laid out a plan and it's like
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.060]   listen, you need to start managing costs better managing
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:08.940]   OPEX better return a ton of cash buy back the stock and
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.340]   you'll be a darling and Tim Cook was rewarded and he's
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.540]   been rewarded with an incredibly performant company
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.660]   and so you know, Google is slowly inching towards that
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:24.140]   plan. Microsoft is in that plan and so the only big four
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.340]   horsemen that hasn't really gotten the script yet is meta
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.500]   but they will. It's just we're just debating when and so
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.620]   there's a perception that you know, meta will copy what the
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.380]   rest of these big guys do but these other long tail
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.540]   companies, the headwinds are just greater and so when you
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.980]   you know, don't have a company that can be broadly owned by
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.660]   intelligent, thoughtful investors. That's a headwind
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.660]   right when you give nobody votes, that's a headwind and so
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.020]   that's why you see a company that's continuing to grow
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:03.260]   impact not being able to translate that into economics
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.820]   and if I were the board of that company, that should be a
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.620]   wake up call because eventually that'll flow into the morale of
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.660]   the employees and the ability to retain and then the ability
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.500]   to invest in the future and I think the simple answer is
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:19.660]   enough with all these, you know, gymnastics around control.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.620]   You know, if you looked at Elon, the most incredible thing
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:27.180]   from day one was there's common stock, you know, and his whole
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.740]   thing was like, I'm just going to do the best and you know
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.540]   what? If I'm not the best, I'm going to be out. He's literally
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.860]   said, he has never ever vote me out. He's never ever played
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:41.180]   these games. So in this funny way, control is a symbol of a
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:45.420]   lack of ability to run the business. Masterful mastery of
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.740]   a business. You can translate that to being I'm just going to
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:51.020]   have common stock. Well, I mean, if you think about historical
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.700]   argument, by the way, I'm tracking back to the high
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.860]   voting class for founders was that they would be challenged by
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.180]   the investors in the market and you can see the things that
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:04.220]   Carl Icahn and others asked for. They say, we want to see
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.180]   you cut opex. We want to see you pay dividends. We want to
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.260]   see you buy back stock and we want to see you grow. And so
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.180]   the trade off then in the mind of a founder that that that
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.980]   started this business and scaled it to billions in revenue is
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.020]   well, that means I've got to make short term decisions over
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.420]   long term decisions. I've got to make the I got to give up
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.740]   some of my long term opportunities to trade for my
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.740]   short term opportunity. That's the that was the argument I
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.460]   think originally for the voting class and you can read this in
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.740]   Google's founders letter as well. Does that not apply
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.940]   anymore? Founders at Google don't even show up at the
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.620]   company. Why do they have to have super voting control? They
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.820]   don't probably even know what's going on inside the company. It
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.420]   might have been argument like so. No, no, I just I just want
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.540]   to hit on Zuck's point because Zuck has said, look, you know,
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.940]   this this VR AR metaverse stuff in the future is everything.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.260]   This is where I want to invest our resources. It's a little
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.220]   bit of time. But look what happened. They they made a
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.340]   missive. They said, we're going in this direction. Investors,
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.660]   really smart, thoughtful, supportive investors, including
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.700]   Brad were like, uh, hold on. We're check your check your
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.860]   role and they capitulated. Now, to your point, did super voting
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.740]   control come into play there? No, of course, he could have
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.060]   said, you know what guys, pound sand, I'm going to do what I
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.340]   want. Instead, he's like, I'm a smart guy. These guys are smart
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.820]   guys. So I'm going to make the smart decision. So in my
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.060]   opinion, all of these things are red herrings. These are
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.020]   indirections, right? So this idea of I'm just going to take
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.540]   my toys out of the sandbox like a crying baby is what super
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.980]   voting control means to me as a shareholder. Brad, I think the
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.020]   era of super voting control for founders taking companies
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:44.540]   public is over. Nope. Should it be? You know, I think it's
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:49.020]   again, when Facebook was doing really great and Snapchat was
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:53.260]   doing great, nobody complained about super voting stock. Okay.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:58.300]   So I think that, you know, my preference would be that I
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.660]   partner with a company where I know the founder, whether
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.620]   irrespective of their votes, right, listens, cares, and has
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:11.020]   the mental flexibility to make course corrections. Right. And
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.300]   the reality what I'm trying to point to, we have lived through
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:19.020]   a decade of excess. Everybody knows all these companies could
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.860]   do exactly the same revenue. David, this is the pushback to
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.220]   your point, unlike what the Google argument was exactly the
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:31.180]   same revenue with vastly less investment in terms of people,
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:38.060]   etc. Right. A 20% riff at meta would literally only take them
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.780]   back to where their personnel expense was in 2021. Yeah,
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:47.020]   nobody argued in 2021. And they said they were going to do this
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.060]   too, Brad, right and just hasn't happened yet. This is this is
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:55.900]   part of the problem, Jay Cal. Everybody. So why 10%? Why 10%?
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.460]   You've doubled the number of people working in the business
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.660]   over the last few years. Right? There's nothing magical about
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.100]   10%. The real question is, what is the optimal number of
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.380]   employees to produce the best outcome for our customers and
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.740]   our advertisers? And what Bill Gurley has pounded on, and
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.460]   we've all talked a lot about, there has been in a zero cost of
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:21.100]   capital world, a unilateral march to more, more of
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.900]   everything, invest in everything, hire more people,
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.300]   Silicon Valley would do itself a favor. These big companies
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.420]   vacuumed up every single engineer in Silicon Valley, they
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.140]   ought to return that pool to the startups that are actually
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.260]   inventing the future. They don't need this money employees. I
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.380]   mean, last night, I read a report came across Bloomberg
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:45.580]   that the Elon's talking about 75% reduction at Twitter. Yeah,
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.660]   so that would leave Twitter just to give people some context
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.460]   here that was that originated in the Washington Post that would
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:55.340]   take them from around 7500 workers to maybe 2000 1800. So
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.100]   he's starting from first principles, how many people do I
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.340]   need to build the next generation of Twitter? That's
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.620]   the question. Start with a blank sheet of paper and ask that
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.460]   question, you'll come up with very different answers.
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:13.660]   Back to the governance question, I think that you can correlate
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:19.100]   these kinds of governance overreaches with zero interest
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.940]   rates. That dog doesn't hunt when rates are at four or 5%. I
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.980]   don't care who you think you are. But when you try to go
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.020]   public in over the next four or five years, if rates are
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:34.140]   sustained, you know, three, four or 5%, that will be the check
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.420]   on all of these people's overreach because you will have,
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.180]   you know, liquid alternatives that on a risk adjusted basis
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:45.740]   seem better. And when rates are zero, and everybody was forced
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.900]   to own tech, we all gave up our standards, we all stopped
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.460]   saying, you know, oh, you know, the things that we used to think
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:57.100]   were important before, like one person, one vote, you know, a
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.660]   check between the board and the CEO, a check between the
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.580]   executives and the shareholders, they'd all went out the window,
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.220]   no discipline, no hygiene, right? Because when interest
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.900]   rates are at 0%, you have to remember, right? How does how
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:16.380]   does the the structural basics of of the financial markets work?
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:22.220]   It is meant to make money on behalf of every single entity
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.780]   and person and thing in the world from a pension fund to a
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.140]   university to a research lab to a government to an individual.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.860]   But in that ability to make money, when we took interest
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:39.180]   rates to zero, 40% of what we all used to own bonds yielded
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:43.500]   nothing. And so we just completely whipsaw to the other
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.260]   side and said, we need to own anything that grows. So tech got
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.700]   a disproportionate amount of attention. But in that we lost
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.300]   our standards. And we are now going to go through the hangover
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.500]   of dealing with it. And so, you know, snap will be an example of
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:02.620]   where investors are going to abandon that company. Because
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.300]   because it's just there's no point. There's no governance,
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.500]   there's no ability to have a conversation. It's in the too
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:13.740]   hard bucket. So people will just leave it, it'll be stranded,
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.260]   and it'll be a refugee in the public markets. I think meta
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.820]   will be fine eventually, because I think that they will revert to
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:22.540]   the mean. And the mean is Microsoft, Google and Apple. And
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.580]   we already know what that playbook looks like. So I think
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.100]   what Brad predicts is more likely than unlikely. And I
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.460]   think in the future, to David Friedberg's point, I think it
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.500]   will be very hard to justify these things. You know, bankers
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.780]   will be able to push back, because the buy side, ultimately
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.100]   guys like us who have to buy the stock when these things go
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.100]   public will say, Nope, you want to have these, you want to have
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.660]   these dumb governance games? Nope, not for me. I'll just go
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.540]   buy something else. I'll go buy more Tesla, where it's one
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:56.220]   person, one vote. Why, you know, so it's hard when the best CEO
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:02.060]   in the world is like, judge me, keep me fire me on an equal
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.020]   basis. And everybody else is like, I'm smarter than this guy.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.660]   And so you know what, let me make sure that whenever I feel
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.980]   like it, I can throw a temper tantrum and take my toys out of
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.620]   the sandbox. And let's use there's an analogy here doesn't
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:16.620]   work. Look at look at Steve Jobs ousted from his own company.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.940]   Company made a huge mistake asking him. Some people argue
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.820]   it was a learning experience for Steve to get better at his
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.460]   job, he comes back, and he absolutely turns the company
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.980]   around. So there's an example. Thus far, you've proven that the
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.820]   two most impactful and important CEOs of the last 50 years had
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.940]   the courage to basically say, let my performance do the
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.700]   talking, not my protective nanny control.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.260]   Correct. And Steve's performance was light in that
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.540]   first period, he had some problems, and he learned, and he
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.820]   still won. But this is what the greats do the greats know how to
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.820]   perform not, you know, use some no trade clause to make sure
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.620]   that you can just sit there and underperform forever.
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.740]   Do we think Brad, when we get to the sort of macro look at
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.860]   this, let's assume we're in this four or five or three, four or
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:04.940]   5% interest rate for some extended period of time, let's
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.820]   call it a decade. What does the tech industry look like?
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:12.300]   Because it does seem if Elon does with Twitter, what seems to
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.860]   have been leaked here correctly, according to our reports. And
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.940]   there's a 20% riff at Facebook, and we start to see people take
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.220]   the medicine. Is that the ultimate setup for now? Hey,
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.460]   these companies are being run to throw off cash. And we have
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.500]   some way out of this, what people think is going to be a
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.220]   very hard landing?
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:36.300]   Well, I mean, you know, first, just let's talk about, you know,
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.900]   where rates are, you know, today, you know, we're at four,
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.660]   three on the on the 10 year, I mean, technology's performed
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.980]   incredibly well for a long period of time with rates in
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:51.420]   this, in this range. So the adjustment period is very
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.540]   difficult. Right. And so when you when you look at the
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.980]   convexity, and going from zero percent interest rates to four
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:01.500]   and a half, like that has been a shock to the system, it has
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.260]   been destabilizing to multiples, multiples were basically
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.540]   infinite last year. And now multiples have come back to
[00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:14.300]   reality. And so I don't question in fact, I actually think free
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.460]   capital was a weapon of economic destruction. Right free
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.140]   capital hurt good companies from being great companies. They
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.580]   hired too many people, their margins were too low, you know,
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.380]   SoftBank funding, all of these rideshare companies around the
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.100]   world to compete with Uber meant that Uber, even though they're a
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:35.180]   market leader, did not have market leadership economics. And
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:40.540]   so the ringing out of the system of that excess that grift, that
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.900]   stupidity, that's going to be good for the fundamentals of
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.180]   these business, but the transition from, you know, that
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.900]   low rate environment to the high rate of our it's dislocating
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.260]   for investors, it's dislocating for management at these
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.980]   companies, and it's going to be dislocated. This is not, you
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:59.820]   know, a six month phenomenon, we're going to have two years of
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.100]   ringing out, right? Because there's no bailout here by the
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.940]   Fed, there's no v shape recovery for these companies, this is now
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.900]   going to be I heard somebody say this week, if the last 10
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:15.340]   years was about beta, the next 10 years is about alpha, not all
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.220]   companies are going to do well, not all companies are going to
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.820]   bounce back. This is going to be about what companies have the
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:26.300]   courage to build great products and to drive a great business
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.300]   model that allows them to compete and continue to invest
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.660]   at high rates in the next wave of innovation, whether it's AI,
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:40.300]   etc. And so, you know, to me, the markets J Cal have largely
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:45.100]   put in a box at this point, inflation and rates, right rates
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:49.500]   have come up 65%. And, you know, from 2.7 to four, three in the
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.860]   last 60 days, and the markets basically sideways, it's down
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.300]   five to 10%. Rates are up another 10% in the last two
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:00.140]   weeks, and Google and Apple are up. That tells me that the
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.980]   market's gotten, you know, gotten its arms around rates and
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:06.620]   inflation, what the market really is worried about now are
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:10.220]   two things. Number one is earnings. And number two is the
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.460]   long tail of risk. On earnings, there's kind of a conventional
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:20.140]   wisdom emerging from from many folks that 3200 is the bottom or
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:25.420]   maybe 2700 the bottom that we're going to go from 225 and in S&P
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:31.100]   earnings back to 200. That seems to me to be, you know, again, a
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.620]   lot of people making that bet. I don't see any evidence in Q3
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.580]   earnings, United Healthcare, United Airlines, Schlumberger,
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:43.180]   Tesla, etc. Their earnings are up on a year over year basis.
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.620]   They've guided now to Q4, their earnings are going to be up on
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:50.860]   a year over year basis. And the consensus expectations in Q1
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.500]   are that earnings are going to be up on a year over year basis
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:59.100]   to go from 225 down to 200. It can't just be a slowing of the
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.460]   rate of growth of earnings, you have to reverse course entirely.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.180]   So we have to see something we're not seeing yet. So on an
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.580]   earnings growth, that's where the market, there's some tension
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.300]   in the market. Then finally, what I would say is there are a
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.100]   lot of big brains in the world who look at this level of
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.860]   dislocation, rates going on the two year or on the front end of
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.700]   the curve from zero to four and a half. And Druckenmiller or
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.940]   Soros would say negative reflexivity. Shit breaks when
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.060]   you have this much volatility in the world. The world is not
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.100]   equipped to deal with these exponential moves. And so
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.420]   there's a lot of concern in the world, whether it's about
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:39.820]   Ukraine, Taiwan, UK bonds, the Japanese yen, nobody knows what
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.420]   it will be. But they're just saying demand a higher margin
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.780]   of safety because the propensity, the likelihood that
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.900]   shit breaks when you have this much dislocation is higher. So
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:54.460]   the proverbial black swan could come any minute and could cause
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:58.140]   another downdraft. But last year, we were all sitting here
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.900]   and said asymmetry to the downside, multiples at all time
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.420]   high interest rates at all time low, we saw that starting to
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:09.260]   roll over, we saw smart people, Elon, Bezos, etc, start to sell
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:14.060]   into it. As I sit here today, yes, we're going to have harder
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.940]   times ahead economically, but it feels to me like a lot of it
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:20.860]   is priced in. I don't think we have huge asymmetry and skew to
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.580]   the downside. I think that's like fighting the last battle.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.540]   It's not to say in this distribution of probabilities,
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.820]   one of those events can't occur. But from my vantage, when
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:34.140]   stocks, the average stock down 20%, stocks like Meta down 50
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:38.620]   to 60%, a lot of stocks down 70, 80, 90, that doesn't seem
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.540]   like the time to call the big short. That seems like a time to
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.460]   be like neutral to positive.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:49.100]   Should we go to TV, PID, PII, and talk about the privates?
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.500]   Well, I just want to say one thing about your prior question,
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:58.140]   which kind of ties into some of what Brad said, but you you ask
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.140]   the question about does this mean that these companies are
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.860]   now going to kind of cut costs and start spitting out cash? I
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.500]   think there is certainly a market incentive to do that to
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.340]   keep share prices up. And the companies that can do that are
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.580]   certainly taking action with the headcount reduction across
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:17.340]   some of the big guys. What I think is going to be interesting
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.980]   and what a lot of people are watching is how many of the
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.660]   small and mid cap guys can actually do that. And those that
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:27.660]   can't, will it will become pretty evident pretty fast. And
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.420]   they're going to end up in the shitter.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.460]   You're talking to a palatine or something like that?
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.380]   Doesn't matter across SAS, across consumer across DTC,
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.700]   across hardware, everyone is now saying, can you actually earn?
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.260]   And at this point, you should have enough scale that you
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.980]   should be able to earn. And if you cannot, the market will
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.860]   punish you for it. And that's certainly what seems to be the
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:53.100]   incentive and the pressure in the on the buy side to the
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.740]   executives across all these organizations today. So I think
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.300]   that's a big trend of what's happening right now, is
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.300]   everyone's going through their portfolio, spending time with
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:04.060]   management and asking, can you earn? Can you actually get this
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.420]   business to generate cash? What is the path? Show it to me,
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.380]   prove it to me in the quarterly results. And if you can't, then
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.060]   you're not fitting in a bucket that I can own you.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.700]   The only irony there, Friedberg, is that that comes as a
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.860]   surprise. God forbid, we should actually expect companies to
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.980]   prove unit economics and to make profits.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.140]   Yeah, but when you when your interest rate zero, you divide
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.380]   by zero, you get infinity. So you know, you were able to kind
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.420]   of explain everything away into the future. Now you actually
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:35.500]   have an interest rate at 5%. I got to be, you know, making a
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.460]   I'm not going to pay a lot more than 20 times earnings. And I
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.300]   want to see that that's really my earnings. You know, I want to
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.420]   see that you can actually earn
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:45.020]   there was a person at Brad's investor day, who Brad
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.300]   interviewed, and I won't say his name, but he's a star of
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:52.300]   stars. He's a bit of a goat. And he had, I'll just say the
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.820]   generalized version of what he said.
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.900]   And said the following, which is so true, it's like we've gone
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:04.620]   through an entire decade of under training an entire
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:08.540]   generation of people in Silicon Valley. You know, we have under
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.980]   under trained and under mentored the product managers, the
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:16.060]   engineers, the senior executive management, the CEOs, many of
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:20.060]   these people, unfortunately, are not. They don't have the
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:24.060]   skill set to execute at a high level at any point in the cycle,
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.740]   except when rates were zero, like many business models. And
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.300]   now that rates are not at zero, these people are turning out to
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.980]   be extremely underdeveloped and unable to run these businesses.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.380]   And when he said that it really struck a chord because he's
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.140]   right. And you know, he was also saying it just got even more
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.140]   exacerbated in this era of remote work. Because now there
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:49.100]   is even less opportunity to mentor and to coach and to talk
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:53.020]   one on one. And people think, you know that this is a boon,
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:57.180]   and it's not. So, you know, we're going to deal with also
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.940]   the aftermath of an entire generation of highly underskilled
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:04.540]   companies. Because the executive and senior leadership and CEO
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.500]   ranks of many of these companies are not in a position to win.
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.140]   If I may, there was an interesting moment this week,
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.460]   when we talk about this discipline that has been lacking
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.060]   the last couple years, 101 million dollar funding led by
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:21.500]   KOTU, Lightspeed Venture Partners. At a $1 billion
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:27.500]   valuation for Stability AI. This is a for profit company
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.500]   built off the backs of the open source project, stable
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.300]   diffusion. They have no revenue, they have no product,
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:38.300]   they've been around for, you know, a millisecond. Any
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:42.220]   thoughts on this type of funding happening pre product
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.460]   pre revenue on an open source project?
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:48.940]   And there's still there's always gonna be, yeah, not my
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.580]   mind is going to be these, these asymmetric bets that
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:54.780]   people think if it works, it's worth 100x. And they'll price
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.820]   it as they price it. I think that I think what we were just
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.900]   talking about is a little different, which is how do
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.820]   public markets rationalize evaluation, these businesses
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.940]   need to start earning for the public investors to be able to
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.460]   represent to their investors, that they're doing their job and
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.300]   making sure that they're holding management accountable
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.180]   to demonstrating earnings potential. But these early stage
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.500]   bets, you can see valuations range depending on the
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.780]   asymmetric outcome potential of the and you know what the
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.340]   upper and you know what the upper bound is the upper bound
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:26.460]   is that when rates were zero, and governments were printing
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.740]   money more than they could get their hands on. The top five
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.100]   tech companies represented a quarter of the S&P 500. But
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.380]   there was a pretty steep fall off. And everybody else
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:40.140]   represented the next, you know, about 10% of the market cap. So
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.740]   the point is that we had bounded outcomes, when rates
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:47.580]   were zero, the average market cap of a successful company was
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:52.140]   around three or $4 billion. So I'm not going to judge this
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.460]   company at all. And those investors are very smart
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.740]   investors, Lightspeed and KOTU. What I will say is at the end
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.780]   of the day, there's a terminal buyer of these companies. And
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:04.380]   we had a period of time that we can look back on to understand
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.340]   that when the party is absolutely rip roaring, the
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.940]   alcohol is free, you know, everything, everything is going
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:14.220]   well. Yeah, we know what the upper bound is, which is the
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.940]   average company, if you were able to get out would be worth
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.820]   about three to $4 billion. And then there was a very, very
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.540]   steep dispersion, where then there was four companies that
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.940]   were, you know, a quarter of the market cap and a few in
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:29.580]   between. So if you do a deal at a billion, the overwhelming
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.980]   odds is that the terminal exit multiple is going to be
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.300]   somewhere between a 3x and a 4x x of dilution, and x of all of
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.340]   the other capital that comes in and all of those features that
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.220]   may be attached. So I think everybody should be allowed to
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:48.620]   make different kinds of bets. And you'll see over time, which
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:53.740]   kind of deal can generate which kind of return. And this will
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:57.260]   be a really interesting data point. The common thinking was
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:01.820]   these kind of deals were not going to happen in this kind of
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.300]   a market. So when you saw this kind of deal happen, or some
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.100]   other that we've talked about privately, what do you think is
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:11.180]   happening in terms of discipline? Private markets?
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.580]   I think I think I think maybe you should tee this up with
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.780]   Brad, because I think that what I have to say follows on, okay,
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.340]   with him, but there's a there's a there's a macro view of the
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.860]   venture industry, that again, it's like everybody wants to
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.900]   never look at the past. Everybody wants to assume that
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:29.500]   this time is different. And there's some work that he did,
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:32.460]   which is really instructive, J. Cal, to help answer this
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:34.140]   question, I think so. Yeah, maybe you should ask him and
[00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:38.700]   then I'll jump in afterwards. This is the TV, TV, pi study.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.660]   Yeah. So I mean, Brad, in relation to my stable diffusion
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:46.140]   and DPI, maybe you can, you know, we shared this with our
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.260]   investors at our investor day that you guys are at this week,
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.500]   and there's a modern industry, it's only been around since the
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:57.740]   mid 90s. Right. So the history of venture, you know, is, you
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:02.060]   got to look at when you look at returns, it's to say, by the
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.660]   way, what an incredible chart you guys put, this is so good.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.580]   Let's describe the chart for people who the truth hurts.
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:14.300]   So break down. Go ahead, J. Cal, do you want to just so if
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.340]   just for people who know we on Spotify, and on YouTube, you can
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:22.300]   search for all in episode 101. And you could see this chart if
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.420]   you're watching the video, if you're listening, the video
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:29.100]   describes 1997 to 2020. There's an orange line across it with
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.060]   the DPI average. So why don't you define DPI?
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.020]   So you know, what we did is we took the top quartile data from
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.380]   Cambridge Associates who invest in all across the entire
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:43.580]   venture industry is widely used as kind of industry data. And we
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:47.660]   just asked a simple question of the top quartile top 25% of
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:52.460]   venture capital firms, right? What were in those vintage years
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:58.540]   of the funds, so funds raised in 97 9899? What were the average
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:04.780]   cash on cash returns, right? TV pi is what your mark is, that's
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:08.860]   where you're carrying the marks total value to paid in capital.
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.420]   So this could be just so we're clear, because it's a little
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:14.460]   confusing to people, you have a company on your books that on
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.980]   paper is worth 10 billion, you had put in at a billion. And on
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:21.020]   paper, you've got this 10x return, right? Correct. Right.
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.380]   It's actually cash distributed to your investors. So that's
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:28.060]   cash on the barrel head. So the reason if you look on this
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.860]   chart, sorry, just just to build just to be very clear for
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:35.980]   everybody, the whole goal is to be able to convert your TV pi.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.380]   So what your theoretical book is worth into DPI, which is here's
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:45.420]   money back to my investors. And what you want on this chart is
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:49.580]   the blue line to catch up to the gray line. So you want the gray
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.140]   line to be as high as possible. And eventually over time, you
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:57.500]   want the blue line to come up. Correct, right. So the blue line
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:01.100]   here, we're looking at 2010. Just for one example, you have a
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:05.660]   four x for the TV pi, you four x everybody's money, but the blue
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.860]   line only got up to it looks like 3.5 x maybe or something in
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.780]   that right. Let me just point out because that's an
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:14.380]   interesting year, Jason. Yeah, we were coming out of the 2008
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:19.260]   2009 period, everybody was despondent. They said, I'm sure
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.820]   they said what you just said about stable diffusion, don't
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.860]   invest in anything, everybody's stupid, but they were incredible
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.460]   companies that were invested out of that vintage, right snowflake
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:32.860]   and Mongo out of our vintage shortly thereafter. So maintaining
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:37.260]   this duality that yes, the world sucks, but the secular curve of
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:40.860]   innovation continues. So that is a vintage where people actually
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.820]   got things sold, got them public distributed the cash back to
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:49.580]   investors. The real question is this, on the vintages between
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:57.260]   2011 2012. And now how how much of those gray lines how much of
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:01.340]   those marks look, those are historical marks, marks have
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:05.660]   never been this high. How much of those marks will actually
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:09.100]   return turn into cash on the barrelhead? And how much of
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:12.380]   those will actually just be mean reversion, it'll all get marked
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.900]   down. And the returns at the top quartile will look much like the
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:20.780]   returns did in the period between 2000 and 2007. My hunch
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:24.620]   is that by the time the cash is actually distributed, the
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:29.500]   returns are going to revert to that orange line mean, which
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.420]   means there are hundreds of billions of dollars in markdown
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:38.460]   sitting in LPS and GPS portfolios that are likely to
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:42.140]   come because nobody really thinks that the deals done in
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:47.020]   1516 1718 are going to be that far above the mean return. And
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.980]   so people also understand this, these are vintage years. So
[00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:53.740]   these are funds formed in that year. And so this trails a
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.860]   venture fund takes about 10 years, they're formed without
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.500]   concept in mind to become realized. So if you're looking
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:04.220]   at you know, the year 2016 and 17. These are but five year old
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:08.620]   funds at this point, right? Correct. Yeah. So they do need
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:12.220]   time for these companies to grow. How much of this trim off
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:16.140]   and free bird do you think is attributable to entry price?
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.140]   Because entry price during 2017 18 1920 is going to be
[00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:23.980]   extraordinarily high entry price, ie the value of the
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:29.020]   company when investors invested in 28 2008 to 2011. When I had a
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:33.820]   lot of my heads was pretty low. I invested in Uber, thumbtack.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:38.940]   And you invest in Uber calm. Those three were $15 million
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:42.540]   combined. three valuations. Yeah, you you invest in Uber?
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.620]   I yeah, maybe third or fourth investor. I can't remember.
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:49.740]   I did get in there. I got in there slightly before you did
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.540]   like maybe you should you should write a book on angel
[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:55.660]   invest. I should translate. You should call it angel. You
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:59.100]   should call it a very good. But let's talk about entry price
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.740]   because entry price does matter Brad, or maybe Chamath you want
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.940]   to take entry price or free bird. Well, look, there's this.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:09.020]   I think I think what that set up is that's probably a chart
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:13.100]   that most VC organizations don't even look at because if you
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:17.660]   looked at that chart, you'd have to take a real investing
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:21.820]   approach to things. So if you were looking at that chart as a
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:27.580]   GP, there are two takeaways. The first takeaway is, oh my
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:32.780]   gosh. What is the sum of the invested dollars above this
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:39.740]   orange line since 2012 2011 right because all of that stuff
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:43.740]   could just basically get whacked if we mean revert and the
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:49.020]   answer is about five or $600 billion of paid in capital. So
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.980]   then you would say, oh my gosh. Well, if there's five or $600
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:56.300]   billion of impairment coming down the pipe, maybe more maybe
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.020]   it's going to be $750 million because the other thing to keep
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:04.780]   in mind is over time. The the orange line has a tendency to
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.420]   go down, not up right because as you add more and more of
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.220]   these things and some slight performers, you have a general
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.980]   decay function in every asset class as it scales in size. So
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.380]   this this orange line theoretically goes down, which
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:20.060]   means more of those great bars get destroyed. Okay. So there's
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:24.300]   let's just call it $600 billion or $700 billion. The most
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.540]   important thing you would want to do is now look inside your
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:32.620]   portfolio and try to answer the question. Oh, how likely am I
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:35.260]   to see that impairment and Jason, this is a proxy of
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.740]   answering your question. The important question for a
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:40.620]   venture fund, which then has a downstream implication to the
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.820]   to the entrepreneur is now what do I do knowing that all of
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.300]   these gray bars could get destroyed and Nick go to the
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.420]   next chart. Well, I calculated it for you guys. So I'll give
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:53.340]   you the answer. Here's a simple thing and you know this is
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:57.100]   publicly available data. Now, why did I do this? Because when
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:01.980]   Brad showed me that chart, my immediate mind went to how do I
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:06.460]   make sure I'm not susceptible to losing a ton of money? Well,
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:09.900]   what happens in markets is that when things go down, the things
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:13.100]   that are highly correlated go down the most because they are
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.820]   the things that are the most highly trafficked, which means
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:18.540]   that they are the things that have the most investors, which
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.020]   means that in an up market, they have the propensity to have
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:25.820]   the highest prices. So we put we you know pulled all this data
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:27.900]   from pitch book and we just started to I just took a
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.940]   smattering of firms here and recent index, Greylock
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:34.220]   Benchmark, Sequoia, GC, Founders Fund, Tiger, Excel,
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:37.180]   Kleiner, Kostler, and us. You could pick anybody because this
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:41.420]   data is publicly available and I started to calculate the
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:45.100]   overlap coefficient. So how how correlated are you with other
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:49.340]   people's portfolios trying to estimate at the upper bound and
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:53.420]   at the lower bound, what will happen? So Jason, this is a a
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:56.060]   proxy of answering your question. What about entry
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:59.500]   price? Well, if you have a very low correlation, which touch
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:06.220]   would we have, you're less you're less exposed to bad
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.860]   entry price because it wouldn't have been a bidding war to get
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:11.660]   into these companies. Exactly. You picked your right spot. You
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:14.860]   you went into areas that were earlier so you were able to risk
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:17.740]   manage a little bit better but if you have a highly correlated
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:22.380]   portfolio, now your marks become very susceptible. So, my guess
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:26.460]   is if you take the $700 billion and you calculate it for all the
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:30.300]   VCs and you look at their correlations and their overlaps,
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.820]   you can probably guesstimate where that $700 billion of
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:37.740]   impairment will come to and you can you can lay it out across
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:39.980]   any organization that you're interested in trying to find a
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:43.260]   solution for by just stack ranking them and by looking at
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.980]   the at the at these correlations and this is by the way to be
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:49.420]   clear. Nothing about the quality of the organization or the
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:52.220]   people but this is just simple portfolio mathematics and how
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:55.500]   portfolios tend to play itself out in moments like this. Well,
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.220]   and there's some interesting data in here as well. I I
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:02.300]   Freiburg, you probably are aware of where some fund like let's
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.660]   say Founders Fund and Kosla have a close relationship because
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:08.220]   Keith Ruboy was at Kosa and then he moved to Founders Fund. So,
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.700]   you see that nice dark purple there where they have a high
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:13.980]   correlation investments. Interestingly, index seems to
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.860]   just follow benchmark and Bill Gurley's investments and plow
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:18.940]   into the that seems to be the highest correlation. But see,
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:21.820]   here's the thing. If you had to steel man the defense of that
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:25.500]   strategy, Jason, I would say in an upmarket, benchmark is a
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.860]   $500 million fund where I get no allocation. If I was a smart
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:32.460]   LP and I did this work, I'd be immediately knocking on index's
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.780]   door saying, can I put money in you? Because in the back of my
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.580]   mind, it's basically getting leverage on benchmark's
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:40.300]   portfolio. Yeah, you figured out how to follow them. Yeah.
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:45.580]   Yeah. But when the cycle reverts, you know, you're not
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:48.300]   the only one that wants to copy benchmarks portfolio. Everybody
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:51.980]   does. And if these correlations are too high and the overlaps
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:55.820]   are too high, then you start to get into a cycle where you put
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:59.020]   yourself in a position to actually suffer from the market
[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:02.220]   beta much more. Yeah. Even when you can benefit from the market
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:05.660]   beta and up cycle. Freiburg, you want to analyze this chart
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:12.300]   and Chamath's thinking here his theory? I don't know. I mean, I
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:16.460]   just think this has become a pretty competitive market and a
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:21.660]   lot of the value has been competed away. Well, I mean, I
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:26.060]   think for a layperson, please. Yeah, the long term value
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:31.020]   creation of technology of new technology is going to remain
[00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:34.940]   high. The market's going to pay for that. So you know, new
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:38.620]   market value creation, new market cap is going to continue
[00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:44.300]   to be built every year. What's happening when venture has a low
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:50.700]   multiple is that number one, the good companies end up the
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:54.940]   founders end up owning more of the company. And they end up,
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:57.020]   you know, having a higher percentage ownership when the
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:00.380]   company ultimately gets sold or goes public, because they were
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.900]   able to get VCs to compete against one another. And as a
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.500]   result, pay a higher valuation and as a result, buy less of the
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:11.740]   company. And then number two is that because the VCs that
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:14.140]   couldn't get into that company still had a bunch of money to
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:17.500]   manage, they went and put money into crappy companies. So you
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:21.260]   know, it's a lucrative business. You guys, everyone's in that
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:23.500]   business because it's a lucrative business. And that
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:27.580]   certainly it takes a decade to realize whether or not you're
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:31.180]   good at it. So you know, you have this period of time as Brad
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:35.100]   shows that maybe a decade before the LP market learns who is and
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:39.100]   who isn't bad. And meanwhile, those folks who got competed out
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:41.820]   of the good deals, you know, they don't look very good. And
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:43.900]   the folks that are left in the good deals own less of the
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:47.660]   company, and their returns get diminished. And, you know, I
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.620]   think ultimately, this market is probably going to end up being
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:53.900]   a multi decade cycle of capital in and capital out, we're
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:56.860]   probably at peak capital being managed in venture funds right
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.740]   now, and will likely decline for the next decade.
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:03.340]   Brad, how would you Brad, how would LPS look at Chamath
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:06.380]   analysis there? And how do they look at the clubby nature and
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:10.300]   overlap, you know, writ large in our industry, and then whatever
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.420]   other insights you have?
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:15.900]   Yeah, no, I mean, I think I very much disagree with David,
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:19.500]   that all the returns are getting competed away. The huge
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.380]   difference between the venture market and the private equity
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:26.140]   market or the public market is that the venture market is
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:30.700]   unquestionably a power law market. Okay, 90% of the gross
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:34.460]   profits and the returns go to 10% of the deals and 10% of the
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:37.740]   investors, right. So we just show the average of the top
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:41.020]   quartile. But if we show benchmark one or two or
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:44.860]   benchmark six or seven, it's ridiculous, right? The cash on
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:49.180]   cash returns over 20x on those funds.
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:52.780]   Let's just pause and explain that to folks. Most venture
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.500]   firms here are getting two x on average, that's the average. And
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.540]   is that average for the top quartile or all VC firms?
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:02.780]   It's the top quartile of VC firms, their average is two x.
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:06.940]   Yeah, this is an upper 20 to 25%. So if you were to include
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.740]   the 75 bottom, what would the trash?
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.060]   Brad, let me ask you a question. What if instead of looking at
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:15.580]   the top quartile, you just looked at the top 10 venture
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:18.940]   firms? Yeah, because the number of venture firms has exploded
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:22.460]   over the last decade and a half. But so but I think the point
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:25.500]   that you're not getting is the top 10 changes every vintage.
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:29.500]   And the problem is, if you are aping the wrong portfolio in
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:32.540]   that vintage, you'll get run over. Right. And so the real
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:37.100]   goal of this, and I also tend to disagree, freebrook with what
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:39.500]   you say, I don't think the returns are getting competed
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:43.100]   away. I actually think it's more alpha than ever. Correct. And
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.980]   you got to be a good picker. And if you're a momentum
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:49.980]   investor, you just need to be aware on the way in that you are
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:54.060]   going to put your portfolio under tremendous pressure in
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:56.940]   drawdowns. I think the other thing, the other thing it does.
[00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:01.100]   This idea of the industrialization of venture, the
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.780]   soft banks, the tigers, like, like, it's a myth. You can't
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:07.100]   industrialize that you can industry, you can build an
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.740]   index fund to the public market, because you can buy every
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:13.340]   company, you might even be able to build an index like fund in
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.580]   private equity, because everybody can go bid for every
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:20.780]   company. But in venture, the founder chooses you. That early
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:26.460]   GP chooses you. And so if you try to build an index fund, that
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:29.980]   misses the best deals, and I think there's adverse selection,
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.860]   the bigger you get, the less likely you're to convert the
[01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:36.380]   best deals. Now you're really in trouble. Brad, do you think an
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:42.700]   index of first time VCs outperforms kind of that, you
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.780]   know, top quartile index? So you know, there's some LPs that
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:51.420]   select into just solo GP, first time fund manager, first time
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:54.540]   fund, or, you know, maybe second time, but solo GP, but it's kind
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.860]   of like, you know, first into the market before you really
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.220]   scale up. That's where so many of the returns are found. A lot
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:04.940]   of funds like MIT, they look for emerging managers, because
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:08.780]   you're, you tend to be younger, hungrier, you have experience,
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:12.140]   you've got a lot on the line. But certainly, if you look at
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:16.780]   the hundreds of startups in VC land over the course of the
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:21.180]   last several years, 99% of them are probably garbage and will
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:25.820]   fail and won't work. So the all stars will be all stars and the
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:29.580]   rest won't. Somebody asked me, I use this analog. They said
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:31.660]   hundreds of new people have come into venture. And I said,
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.900]   yeah, it's like, it's kind of like a marathon. You're right.
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:39.180]   We had 500 runners, and now we have 1000 runners. But from my
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:43.020]   vantage, it's the same five to 10 runners competing for the
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:48.220]   podium week in and week out. In that top 10 in that power law,
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:52.540]   it doesn't change a lot. Yes, there have been people break in.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:57.340]   We know how hard it is to break in to Silicon Valley. Nobody
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:01.260]   invited altimeter to the dance. Nobody invited social capital to
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.940]   the dance. Nobody invited Jason Calacanis to the dance. It was
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:06.940]   the opposite. They lock the doors that they were like,
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:13.980]   trust me, because it's a highly lucrative business, dominated by
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.780]   some incumbents that had huge brands, they didn't want to
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:20.460]   share the fruits of that we showed up, we worked hard, we
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:24.860]   build incredible teams. We had conviction, right? And we were
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:28.940]   we also had good fortune, right? Yes, we were smart. We were we
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:31.820]   play some good bets. But you also have to get lucky in this
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:34.860]   business. We were lucky to be born at this point in time
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:37.580]   lucky to start when we did in Silicon Valley. I'm going to
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:40.540]   finish just with this one point. This whole experiment of
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.180]   venture capital is less than 30 years old. The modern age of
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.300]   venture capital is 30 less than 30 years old. We're going
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.460]   through this period where everybody wants to shit all
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:51.260]   over the industry, you know, TVP is going to come down all
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:54.780]   this other stuff. I think that venture my dad when he went to
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.060]   start a business had to borrow money mortgage the house. Think
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:02.700]   about the friction for somebody with a young family. If the
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:06.060]   cost of failure was losing your house, putting your family in
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:10.620]   harm's way, versus some young startup in Silicon Valley today,
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.260]   where the consequence of failure, particularly if you if
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.060]   you conduct yourself with integrity is that you learn a
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:21.020]   lot. Right? There's no losing a house. There's no cataclysmic
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:24.780]   outcome for your family. So to me, when you look at the
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.940]   economic unlock that we have in this country, by reducing
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.980]   friction to invention by reducing friction to
[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:36.380]   experimentation, I am incredibly bullish on the future of
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:40.620]   venture. I think founders are the engine that drives the
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:44.060]   world forward. Right? That's where we get electric cars.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.380]   That's where we get rockets that land themselves. That's
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:51.500]   where we get mRNA vaccines. And so there will be cyclicality.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:54.940]   There will be industrialization, there will be big
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:59.260]   funds and small funds. But the reality is that this ecosystem
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:02.380]   is a massive competitive advantage for this country. I
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.700]   think when we look forward at the information age over the
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:08.940]   next 30 years, the power of this ecosystem is more strategic
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.220]   advantage to this country, even the natural resources.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:15.020]   I'll say I'll say something orthogonal to this, which is in
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:19.100]   order for that to happen. Just to build on the point, Brad, of
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:23.180]   your guests that you're saying, we have an entire generation of
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:28.780]   financially, innumerate general partners, adventure firms,
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:34.620]   and venture needs to be a pillar of growth in society. And I
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:37.500]   think people need to have more financial tools and
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.940]   underpinnings to do their job. Why? Because over these next 10
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:44.300]   years, when maybe you have 500 to three quarters of a trillion
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.740]   dollars of value destruction, and it's because you didn't
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:50.620]   think about portfolio construction properly, that
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.180]   entrepreneur that needs your money, you will have to say no
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:58.300]   to them, or renege on a deal, or let them down. And the reason
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.940]   is that you didn't think about that on the way in. And so these
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:08.140]   are practical skills that every other part of the financial
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.980]   asset infrastructure has to learn, we are taught the hard
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:14.940]   way. You know, we are taught in the public markets how to think
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:18.540]   about dispersion, correlation, alpha, beta, you're taught in
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:21.100]   private equity, how to do it, you're taught in every other
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:25.260]   asset class, and we romanticize venture to think that none of
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:29.020]   that matters. But in a moment like this, you will see how much
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:31.660]   or how much it doesn't matter. And if you're going to live up
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:35.180]   to the to the actual commitment you make to an entrepreneur, you
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:37.260]   better get financially smarter is what I would say.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:42.460]   All right, let's move on. Do you want to go to stock picking
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.180]   or lift versus Newsom on this prop 30?
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:47.740]   I want to hear that free bird diatribe on stock picking.
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:50.620]   You do? Okay, I want to hear it. Well, anyway, there's a
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:55.980]   bunch of people talking about index funds versus buying
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:59.260]   individual shares and being a stock picker. Elon and Kathy
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:03.500]   would got into this on Twitter. And we all know the arguments
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:08.300]   for passive versus active. And there's large active funds out
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:12.380]   there that are just programmatically buying and Elon
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:16.620]   and many think that active would be better for society or a bit
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:18.620]   more active. freebird. What's your take?
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:24.940]   A business is a over time, supposed to be a machine that
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:29.260]   takes money in and puts money out. And then there's money left
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.660]   in the machine. It's like a box money comes in money goes out.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:34.540]   And over time, the objective of the money coming in, which is
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:38.540]   sales or revenue exceeds the money going out and the box
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:42.220]   grows, right, the assets grow. And the best way to look at that
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:45.260]   is in the financial statements of that business, you know, the
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.820]   income statement, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:53.740]   But we and then there's this narrative that can be layered
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.180]   on top of those metrics, that measurement of how well that
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.380]   business is performing over time. And that narrative is what
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:04.140]   drives a lot of investment decisions. Today, right, I see
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:08.140]   whether it's an analyst, writing an analyst report, or portfolio
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.660]   manager or an individual picking a stock, everyone's got a reason
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:14.940]   why they're buying the stock. And they say, here's my thesis.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:19.260]   And what happens is everyone looks at that box, looks at that
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:22.460]   business looks at that thesis from a different angle. And
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.660]   there's always something you're missing. So there, you know,
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:31.500]   there's some element that is driven by imperfect information.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.540]   And in some cases, it's just heavy bias. You know, you look
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.180]   at a stock, you're like, hey, I really like Disney Plus, I
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:40.220]   really like the subscriber growth. But the question
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.300]   fundamentally is over time, what is the revenue generation and
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.340]   the profit generation potential of that one thing you're looking
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:49.900]   at? And what are the 100 other things that are going to
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.420]   contribute to that business that box, taking in more money or
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:56.460]   spending more money? Is that box going to run into a regulatory
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.740]   problem? Is it going to run into a customer problem? Is it going
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.580]   to run into a content problem? Is it going to run into
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:06.380]   competition? The number of issues and opportunities that
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.420]   any one of these businesses can and will face is infinite. And
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:13.260]   every participant in a market is looking at some different set
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:16.700]   of those opportunities or threats. And every participant
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.900]   in that market is making a different value judgment. And
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:23.260]   so very often people will buy a stock because they see their
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:26.140]   sliver, they convince themselves that based on the sliver of the
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:29.260]   perspective that they have, that this is something I want to own.
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:33.260]   They don't do the work on what's the income statement,
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:36.380]   balance sheet cash flow going to tell me over time about the
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:39.100]   quality of that business. And they don't do the work on what
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:42.940]   the valuation of the business is relative to comparables relative
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:45.740]   to future earning potential. And I just wanted to have this
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:51.020]   diatribe because I see so many individuals doing stock picking.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:54.700]   And over time, because of this myriad of things that could go
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:58.540]   wrong and will go wrong, or may go right or won't go right, or
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:01.260]   the regulatory thing or the market thing or whatever
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:04.220]   interest rate thing hits that stock and the stock price goes
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:07.580]   down. Eventually everyone gets hit on the head. And everyone
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:11.100]   reverts to mean or below mean meaning the average of the index
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:16.060]   over time, or underperforms that index over time. And so I mean,
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:19.820]   for me, I spent two years I know we all went through some sort of
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.300]   investment banking training, I spent two years out of college
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:26.780]   without a I had no finance econ or business background. I worked
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:30.140]   in investment banking, learn how to read an income statement
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:33.180]   balance sheet cash flow, learn to understand how business
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:35.260]   performance ultimately translates into financial
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:38.780]   outcomes, and spent a lot of time on valuation. And figuring
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:41.260]   out just because you like the story of a stock, you like the
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.980]   story that the CEO is telling you doesn't necessarily mean
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:46.940]   that you're paying a fair price. So if you if everything
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:50.540]   they do goes right, this price could still drop. And I think
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:53.740]   that this is a really important set of lessons for people that
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:56.700]   are individuals that are doing stock picking, which is the
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:00.220]   number one message and this diatribe is specifically
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:03.980]   targeted towards day traders retail, correct? I don't know if
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:06.060]   it's just them. I think it's just generally like make sure
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.380]   you understand how to read an income statement balance sheet
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.020]   and cash flow statement. Number two, make sure you know how to
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.740]   assess valuation. Make sure you know that when you're buying a
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:17.020]   stock, you know what the total value of the company is based on
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:19.980]   the price you're paying. And how do you justify that that total
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:22.860]   value makes sense relative to your model of the future
[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:26.540]   outcomes for that business. And then number three, recognize
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:29.340]   and be cognizant of the fact that whatever one thing you're
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:32.220]   seeing that you think you've got some edge or some advantage on
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:34.780]   because no one else is seeing it. There's 99 other things
[01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:37.420]   that you're not seeing. And this is where everyone learns this
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:40.060]   lesson over time, and everyone gets bonked on the head at some
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:42.860]   point in making these decisions. And it's why every
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:46.060]   stock picker or nearly every we can talk about the greats at
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:49.500]   some point here, and where alpha can be generated and so on. But
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:53.660]   generally, most stock pickers over time, underperform the
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:57.260]   index. And it's just particularly with the retail
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.260]   movement over the last couple of years, I see a lot of thesis,
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:04.940]   here's my reason for buying the stock that excludes understanding
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:08.300]   the financials got understanding the valuation metrics, and also
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.940]   excludes the whole litany of things and all the diligence
[01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.540]   that goes into thinking about all the other angles you might
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:17.180]   be missing. So that was my model. Or feedback, generally,
[01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:22.380]   it turns out that it's hard to be good at anything. Insert the
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:28.140]   blank takes 10s of 1000s of years of practice. In investing,
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:33.820]   I think what I have learned is that it's very easy to get caught
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:38.620]   up in the mania. I have also learned in the last decade that
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:42.700]   you know, we really benefited from zero interest rates, it was
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:49.260]   a tide that lifted all boats. And I have learned how to think
[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:53.100]   about correlation, and the difference between alpha and
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:57.100]   beta, and how to construct portfolios that I think can be
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:01.020]   all weather portfolios. To Friedberg's point, those are
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:04.460]   nuanced, long tail skills that you'll only take up if you're
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:07.580]   really passionate about the craft. It's not dissimilar to a
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.620]   person, I'm just going to use golf as an example, who learns
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:13.820]   how to hit a fade versus a draw, and who learns how to really
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:16.700]   manipulate, you know, their wedges in very specific ways.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:20.380]   And these are all long tail skills that come in when you
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:25.180]   decide you want to master something. And it's just
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:27.820]   important to note that that mastery is required to be really
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:30.780]   good. Because otherwise, there'll be times where you'll
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:34.300]   go out on the golf course, and you'll crush it. But then, you
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.380]   know, there'll be other times and most other times where you
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.660]   can go and get run over because it's hard. So that's my only
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:42.540]   comment is that this is like everything else. It's not nearly
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.340]   as easy as it looks like Brad, you pick stocks for a living
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:48.860]   should retail, how involved should retail investors be? So
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:51.660]   they just buy an index? I don't think it's fair to say retail
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.700]   what I think my point was really about. No, his point is
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:58.220]   everybody. Okay, sure, everybody. My point is saying a
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:02.220]   thesis, and excluding all these other factors that are critical
[01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.140]   in making a decision about what you're buying, and whether
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:07.100]   you're paying the right price means that you have to make sure
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:10.060]   that you're expanding your point of view on whether or not a
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:13.900]   stock is worth buying at the market price today. And I think
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:17.500]   having that broader perspective is what I see missing in 99% of
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:21.020]   the chatter on Twitter 99% of, you know, folks talking about
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:22.780]   what thing to buy, and why they're buying it. And I think
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:25.660]   it's critically important. You're saying that most
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:30.620]   investing that you see, is very narrative driven. And that
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:35.180]   narrative can sometimes be so powerful, that it overpowers all
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.980]   the other elements that one should be doing to get a full
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:41.180]   picture of why you should be buying something is that I think
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.820]   that's a fair summary to math. Yeah, yeah. And I think it's,
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:49.020]   you know, it's, it's, it's just about how so much of what goes
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:55.020]   on on CNBC, on a lot of Reddit boards, not all of them, there's
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:57.500]   very sophisticated folks, they're doing very sophisticated
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.980]   financial analysis and looking at all the angles of a stock
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:03.580]   assessing the valuation. But so much of these conversations
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:07.420]   exclude what you're paying and what you're getting and exclude
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:11.020]   the broader context of all the things that could and may not
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.620]   happen with a particular business. And as a result, at
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:16.700]   some point, one of those things bonks you on the head, you lose
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.980]   50%. And you're like, Oh, my gosh, my sometimes, and
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:23.740]   sometimes if you try to inject that logic into those channels,
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:24.780]   you'll get Brigadoon.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:29.420]   We absolutely Brigadoon. Brad, what do you what do you think,
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:33.340]   in terms of people's access to markets, I guess would be
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:35.980]   another way to look at this and people's propensity to just,
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:39.100]   you know, gamble, let's call it or maybe not make thoughtful
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:42.380]   decisions. I kind of think of our friend Bill Gurley was here,
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:46.220]   he'd be like, this is a five minute conversation about the
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.660]   statement of the fucking obvious.
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:53.900]   You know, this is stock picking is hard. Really? Is that the
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:58.460]   theme of this section? Yeah. Stock picking is hard. Very
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.500]   little alpha has ever been generated in a sustainable way,
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:05.100]   even by the greatest people of all time. I think, you know,
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:08.860]   maybe something that is a little bit useful to add two things.
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:13.660]   Not all good companies are good investments. Price of entry
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:16.860]   matters. Okay, so I hear a lot of people saying, well, I'm
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:19.340]   gonna buy that because it's a good company that I don't even
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:24.460]   know what that means. Right? Exactly right. Good relative to
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:27.820]   the price of entry. But the second thing is the single
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:31.660]   greatest power we have as investors, the green greatest
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:37.180]   single source of alpha, right other than stock selection. So
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:42.700]   choosing the right company, time arbitrage. Okay, so do you
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:45.420]   have the ability to own something that is a growing
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:48.380]   asset over a long period of time, so that if you got number
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:51.420]   one wrong, you bought it at the wrong time, shit happened in
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:55.020]   the world, they miss a quarter, etc. That you're not forced to
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:58.380]   lock in those losses because you over allocated to that. So
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:01.340]   this idea around portfolio management is a principal
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:04.060]   component of overall stock picking is just absolutely
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:11.420]   critical. So I think, you know, I don't really, I love the fact
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:14.540]   where I put myself through college, I put myself through
[01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:18.220]   law school through business school, day trading stocks out
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.540]   of the back of the classroom, I'm grateful I live in a
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:24.460]   country that let me feel like I had some alpha and that I could
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.100]   do that. And I could go read the newspaper and sort it out. And
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:31.660]   I wasn't building sophisticated financial models. So like, you
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:34.940]   know, I think there are ways that folks can do this, there
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:38.300]   are a lot more ways to lose money than there are to make
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:43.100]   money in a sustainable and durable way. Right. And so as
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:47.020]   investor, what we try to do, you know, we've got 90% of our
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:51.580]   portfolio in our top five or 10 companies. Okay, I'm not an
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:57.180]   index. And the deal I have with our LPs is I'm very transparent
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:01.820]   with them, they know that we're going to own companies in size.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:04.860]   And it's that portfolio concentration and our time
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:08.700]   arbitrage holding companies for three years or longer, that is
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:13.420]   a strategy they choose to believe in and sign up to. But I
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:16.300]   know a lot of greats who would never subscribe to that
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:21.980]   strategy. So know your strategy, execute it, allocate a
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:25.660]   reasonable amount of capital. So when all of these unknowns
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:29.020]   that day, Friedberg talks about come along, you can react
[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:32.540]   accordingly. And you know, the final thing is if it's not fun
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:36.540]   for you, right, like, if you're actually not passionate and
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:39.100]   curious about like studying this stuff and learning about it,
[01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:42.700]   not everybody is, then don't do it. Right, then don't do it,
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.700]   then just put your money in it. I'm gonna be good at it.
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:51.740]   The analytical depth and rigor that the greats employ to be
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.620]   successful at picking stocks and picking businesses and
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:58.060]   investing in them, and selling them at the right time over
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:02.300]   time. It does not make for good Tick Tock content. It does not
[01:18:02.300 --> 01:18:05.740]   make for good short form content. And I think that's why
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:09.900]   we've seen this dumbing down and this kind of short form
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:13.020]   thesis driven narrative approach to content creation around
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:16.940]   markets and stocks that ends up causing a lot of people a lot
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:20.380]   of harm. You know, you watch the Jim Cramers of the world, I
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:23.660]   don't mean to disparage any one individual, but that sort of
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:25.580]   content that's like this is a great company, we should buy it
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:30.780]   like let's go. And the depth and rigor takes a lot of time
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:34.620]   and a lot of effort to really do right. And then you get hit in
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:37.180]   the head. You know, when we and that's that's what I've
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:40.220]   observed lately, and in a really kind of flurried way,
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:43.340]   particularly across social media, and so on. That's, that's
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:45.500]   why I just wanted to talk about this topic today. Just to build
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.580]   on top of what you're saying, Warren Buffett made this very
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:51.340]   famous bet in 2000. It was him versus a bunch of hedge fund
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:53.660]   managers, and they were able to pick a basket of hedge funds.
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:55.740]   And he said, I'm not even gonna pick myself, I'm going to pick
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:19:00.140]   the S&P 500. And the low cost ETF, the Vanguard ETF, and he
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:03.100]   said, we'll check in like 20 years later. Anyways, you know,
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.340]   the punchline of the story Buffett one, he won like a
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:08.060]   million bucks that he donated to charity and these hedge fund
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:12.700]   folks lost. And so to build on your point, Jason, time and time
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:16.460]   again, the smartest investors in the world, ie guys like him
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:19.900]   have shown us that the most predictable way to make money,
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:23.340]   if that is your goal is to own the S&P 500, which is, you know,
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:26.940]   a dynamic index of the 500 best companies in the world. So there
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:30.140]   are these people doing all the hard work for you. And they have
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:33.260]   very strict criteria of who's an S&P 500 company or not. Now,
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:36.540]   yes, if you cherry pick other companies that are not, or you
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:38.860]   concentrate in some, will you generate better returns?
[01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:42.460]   Absolutely. But systematically over time, that thing has
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:46.700]   lurched forward at 8% a year, you know, 9% a year, if you
[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:50.940]   invest dividends, you can approach 10% a year. And so if
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:53.580]   if you really want to just grow your wealth, that's a very
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:57.100]   simple, steady, eddy way to do it. And to take a small amount
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:00.300]   and then go and, you know, experiment with it to learn,
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.460]   makes sense. But I think it's important to make sure you're
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.940]   going there eyes wide open to try to actually learn.
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:07.180]   Buffett, of course, says the index works really well. But
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:10.540]   then he's got 50% of his public portfolio in Apple over the last
[01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:14.700]   few years. So he clearly believes in alpha as well. But
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.340]   you know, back to Friedberg's point, since we brought up
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:20.620]   Buffett, you know, somebody asked Munger, why can't why
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:24.140]   can't people just copy what Buffett does? And he said,
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:29.340]   because nobody likes to get rich slow. Nobody likes to get
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:33.020]   rich slow if you want to what it is 0% rate environment
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:36.540]   remind us all over the course of last few years. Everybody had
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:40.380]   a grift, everybody had to get rich quick scheme. I don't care
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:43.660]   whether it was NFT crypto flipping, or whether it was
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:47.180]   house flipping or whatever it was, everybody thought, you
[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:50.460]   know, this was easy. And frankly, looked at guys like us
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:53.580]   oftentimes and said, you're the dumb ones. You're playing the
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:56.860]   game that's really hard. Why don't you just, you know, flip
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:00.460]   some crypto and I think we're back to a world that if you
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:05.180]   really want to, you know, by the way yourself, how dumb did
[01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:08.860]   you feel? I felt so stupid all these tokens minting minting
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.020]   billionaire billionaire billionaire billionaire,
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:14.700]   billionaire, and I just I just sat on the sideline to your
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:18.540]   point, right? It just made you it made me feel so stupid. I
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.660]   felt super nice. It's like I what who's the customer and how
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.380]   much do you charge him and when you can't get that basic answer
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.020]   of who the customer is and how much it costs for them to buy
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:29.420]   the product or service. It was like Brad's the Brad's point. I
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:32.220]   think the punchline is and then you know, at the 11th hour,
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.540]   it's like there's a tendency to just capitulate and say, okay,
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:37.340]   forget it. I'm in and that's when all the money gets
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:40.140]   torched real quick. There's a proposition here in California
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:43.740]   where we vote on specific ballot measures. Not every state has
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:47.580]   this, but we have prop 30 coming out. This is a 1.75% tax on
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:52.300]   income earned incomes earned over 2 million for the next 20
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.620]   years in California, which by the way, had $100 billion
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:57.660]   surplus that would go towards clean energy. This was proposed
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:02.300]   originally by environmental groups, but Newsom has come out
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:06.780]   to battle against this, which would seem counter intuitive
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:10.300]   because he's so pro environment. What this would do is spend
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:13.580]   about 80% of this 100 billion in new tax revenue over the next
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:17.420]   20 years, 80% would go towards charging stations for EVs and
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:21.980]   motivating customers to buy EVs. 20% would go toward to
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:26.700]   combat the crazy amount of wildfires we're having here. He
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:31.900]   Gavin Newsom that is called this a cynical scheme devised by a
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:35.500]   single corporation lift to funnel state income tax revenue
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:39.340]   to their company. Lift has provided almost all of the 40
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:43.820]   almost 48 million in funding for this prop 30. And the reason is
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:48.140]   because California is going to require 90% of ride sharing
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:51.500]   miles to be traveled by zero emission vehicles in 2030. You
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:54.060]   know, on top of that, that California is going to not let
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:58.140]   you sell anything other than EVs in 2035. If this continues,
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:00.540]   now you've got a bunch of people on the other side of this doing
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:03.820]   anti prop 30, including the California Teachers Association
[01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:08.060]   because they want the money. Read Hastings over at Netflix
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:12.540]   Moritz over at Sequoia Sam Altman over at Open AI. Well,
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:17.500]   what do you think of this? freeberg? I'm curious. Sorry,
[01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:22.060]   what side are they on Jacob? The side of lift Altman? No,
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:24.460]   they're they're saying don't do this because they are trying to
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:27.900]   control taxes in Carolina. They're on Newsom side, Newsom
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:31.900]   side. Hey, this is a grift by lift, because lift is concerned
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:37.500]   that they're going to have to, you know, bear the brunt of 90%
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:40.140]   of miles. So I guess the I don't know if it's original sin, but
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:46.220]   the the one of the levers here is lift is got the majority of
[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:49.100]   their rides are in California. Uber has stayed out of this
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:52.220]   because they don't have as much exposure because the number of
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.220]   rides in California is a smaller percentage of their
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:56.460]   overall revenue. Brad, Brad, you have some thoughts to hear. I
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.820]   think it's a freeberg or Brad, I'm just looking at the board
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:02.700]   of directors and left and thinking to myself, good God,
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:07.740]   what are these people thinking? Spending 40 to $50 million on
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:10.860]   this, it just seems that they've totally lost the script. The
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:15.740]   company has way bigger problems, way bigger problems to focus on.
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:21.260]   Right, then, you know, this measure, have a little faith in
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:24.780]   the system that if we don't get to a place where this is
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:28.300]   reasonably practical over the next 10 years, then I'm sure we
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:32.300]   will evolve, right? The legislation around this, you
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:36.060]   know, kudos to Dara and the team at Uber for not running scared
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:38.940]   on this, right for not trying to push this through these
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:41.740]   corporate governance initiatives, guys does
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:45.020]   referendums in this state. I mean, this is just bad politics,
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:47.820]   bad policy. I mean, we got Valerie Jarrett on the board of
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:50.300]   this company, you got political sophistication on the board of
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:53.580]   this company. I want to be I wish I was a fly on the wild and
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:56.620]   know the conversation that went down and who raised their hand
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:25:00.060]   and said this is the highest and best use of $40 million of our
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:03.100]   money. Crazy. Yeah, right. It makes no sense. freeberg. You
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:05.580]   have thoughts on if I mean, you've talked before about how
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:08.060]   you think the free market should solve. What is the what is the
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:12.620]   governance structure at lift guys? I knew that was coming. I
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:15.420]   knew it was coming. Did they have super voting shares?
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:18.540]   Anybody look, I don't know the answer to that. So I think that
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:23.020]   the tax rate in California is high enough now that we all have
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:25.580]   friends, friends in our poker group who have left for the
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:28.300]   state of Texas or the state of Florida, where there are lower
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.380]   tax rates and where they feel like they're getting more value
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:34.940]   for their tax dollars. There's certainly a calculus going on
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:38.540]   with Newsom, I believe in, you know, the impact that having
[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:42.140]   higher tax rates would have on what is clearly not just a
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:47.180]   theoretical, but an actual evidence. You know, exodus from
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:50.380]   the state of wealthy and high income earners. This could be
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:52.460]   like, you know, at some point, there's a tipping point that
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:55.340]   looks a lot like France, where you raise the rates high enough
[01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:58.380]   enough wealthy people leave and the net tax dollars actually go
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:00.540]   down, like what happened in France when they introduced
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:03.500]   their wealth tax, then they reversed it and everyone came
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:09.500]   back. I will say I don't more important long term point, I
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:12.860]   don't see a world where we don't have over 60% tax rates on the
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:15.660]   wealthiest people in this country at a federal level. If
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:21.740]   you look at if you assume a 5% long range, call it 1520 year
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:28.780]   horizon for for interest rates, even 4% on $30 trillion of
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:32.940]   outstanding debt. And you assume that the voter base will never
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:37.500]   vote to reduce Social Security or Medicare entitlement
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.540]   programs. And obviously, the defense budget won't get cut,
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:43.820]   we are not going to see a situation in this country on a
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.780]   federal basis, where we can actually meet all of our fiscal
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:50.380]   obligations without incremental tax revenue. And I think it is
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.700]   much more likely that you know, look, whatever happens with the
[01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:55.260]   state initiative happens, but I think it's very likely that over
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:59.660]   time, the only way for the United States to bridge its
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:02.540]   fiscal gap is going to be to raise income to increase the
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:05.100]   tax rates. I don't see another solution because I don't think
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:08.460]   that the federal government or in our kind of democratically
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:11.180]   elected Congress, we're going to see a system that's going to
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:14.140]   say, hey, let's go for austerity measures, let's reduce
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:17.340]   entitlement programs. Both sides will say that it's just not
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:20.220]   going to happen. So tax rates, higher tax rates, I think are
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:23.500]   coming. Well, you know, maybe California will skip over this
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:27.020]   particular generation. But I don't see how the United States
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:30.620]   continues to thrive over the next 15 to 20 years without tax
[01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:33.740]   rates that will today seem exorbitant. Well, in the last
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:38.700]   20 years, we blew through a debt to GDP that was I think 57%
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:42.780]   and it basically doubled. And so David, to your point, when we
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:46.780]   wanted to feel prosperous, what we did was we financed it, we
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:50.140]   went out and we, you know, put out a ton of debt in order to
[01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:53.260]   make sure that our entitlement spending or defense spending or
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:56.860]   whatever the things were that we needed as a population to feel
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:00.380]   like we were growing and moving forward as a society we had. So
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:03.660]   that is the practical nature of what happens. And look, a lot
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:09.020]   of people think that there is some upper bound to debt to GDP
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:11.580]   and I'm actually of the opposite view, which is I think
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:14.220]   that, you know, the quote unquote invisible hand
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:18.620]   justifies us moving debt to GDP to higher and higher rates. So
[01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:22.620]   the first time the United States went past 100%, we thought it
[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:25.100]   was the end of the world. It turned out it wasn't. We'll
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:28.700]   eventually go past 200. Somebody will clamor and, you
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:31.500]   know, be anxiety riddled, but they'll take some SSRIs,
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:34.300]   they'll be okay, we'll keep moving forward. Then we'll get
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:38.540]   to 300%, we'll keep moving forward. So we are in a debt
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:42.380]   spiral that is a feature, not a bug of how democratic societies
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:48.060]   work. As a companion to that, I do agree with you that taxation
[01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:51.580]   kind of is a pendulum. It ebbs and flows. And, you know, we're
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:54.540]   in the part where it's going to go higher before it goes lower.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:58.380]   But I want to tell you a story, which is that in the beginning
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:02.700]   of this summer, or sorry, this fall, I was in the Middle East
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:05.980]   and then I was in Asia, and they have very different taxation
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:10.700]   schemes, right? And many of them have zero corporate gains tax
[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:15.020]   and, you know, sometimes zero income tax. But then the
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:17.820]   opportunities for them to be able to invest in driver turns
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:21.180]   is also commensurately lower, meaning there's not as much
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:23.500]   alpha in most of the opportunities that they see.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:27.660]   Whereas if you go to California, you have to pay 60% tax, but
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:30.620]   then, you know, you could be an angel investor in Uber, you
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:33.820]   know, and all of a sudden take 25,000 and turn it into 100
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:39.900]   million, which is ungodly. It's incredible. So I think that in
[01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:42.540]   my opinion, actually, like there's actually this beautiful
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:46.300]   symmetry where even if taxes are high, your earnings potential
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:49.500]   is commensurately higher, such that the net that you're left
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:53.420]   with is the same as if you were in another place where taxes
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:55.660]   may be zero, but you're just not going to get exposed to the
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:58.860]   same ways to make money. And I think obviously, there's corner
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:03.740]   cases where that's not true. But I don't think sweating taxes
[01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:06.620]   is a really important waste. It's important way to spend
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:08.780]   somebody's time. I just think it doesn't matter.
[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:13.260]   Rad funnel work, I would just say, the beautiful thing about
[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:18.700]   federalism is we get to a B test in real time, different points
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:23.420]   of view. And so we're seeing the biggest a B test, maybe in the
[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:26.300]   history of federalism between the state of California, the
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:29.500]   state of Texas and the state of Florida. And it's not just tax
[01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:34.460]   rates, right? When when Elon leaves to go to Texas, we have
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:37.420]   the head of the California General Assembly, right,
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:40.380]   changing her Twitter profile to say good riddance and flipping
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:44.700]   the book flipping the bird to Elon, right? There is a
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:49.100]   hostility toward business that has emerged in California that I
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:52.220]   think is commensurate and related to the tax rate, but
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:55.660]   also separate. At the same time, we have the mayor of Miami
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:59.420]   texting us, asking us to come down for a visit. We have
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:02.780]   friends in Texas who are literally politicians who are
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:05.980]   marketing their state to people in California. And we're going
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:08.220]   to be able to political scientists will look back in
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:11.340]   five or 10 years. And they'll be able to answer those questions
[01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:14.940]   for you. But I suspect that that makes us a much stronger place
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:18.460]   for experimentation than countries like France, where
[01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:19.420]   it's all or none.
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:24.140]   And just to give people an idea to transport about point about
[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:28.860]   debt to GDP. Here's the chart early part of our lifetimes 50%
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:36.460]   1990s 6070% after the Great Recession, the pandemic 120%
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:41.260]   Japan's at 200%, I think. So there's obviously doesn't it
[01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:43.900]   doesn't mean anything. I know that your payments might at
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:46.700]   some point. Yeah, I really don't think so. Because I think what
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:49.500]   will happen is you'll just move the yield, you know, the yield
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:52.940]   to maturity will move out. And, you know, we'll issue again,
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.940]   you know, this is the funny thing we talked about this last
[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:58.300]   night at poker, like, you know, Trump's ideas, some of them were
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:01.660]   actually very brilliant. They were just packaged through this
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:04.460]   lens of being a total goofball. So you could take it seriously.
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:09.740]   But 100 year bonds, when rates were zero, now looks like, oh,
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:12.140]   my God, what a brilliant move. Well, I mean, if you could take
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:15.100]   a 50 year worldview about climate about nuclear energy
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:17.980]   about semis, we didn't get to semiconductors again this week,
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:20.540]   we got so much good stuff. But, you know, we do need to take
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:23.980]   very long multi decade looks at investment and why not make a
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:28.780]   25 or 50 year bond for semiconductors? Can I actually
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:32.300]   just do a small PSA? Sure, quickly. Public Service
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:34.540]   announcement from trauma, the more you know, go, I went to
[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:39.420]   blue bottle coffee today, and I asked for a latte. And they gave
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:42.380]   me a latte with oat milk. That's their default, which is
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:46.780]   disgusting. And I find out, I find out that is now their
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:50.380]   default. And brutal. And I said, there's a lot of normal
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:53.980]   people that don't want to ingest that chemical spew into
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:57.900]   their body. And so this is just a shout out, like just a comment
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.620]   to blue bottle, like, can you please realize that a lot of us
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:03.740]   are normal, we want to come to your store, and then you know,
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:07.100]   not have to ask for the long tail alternative. Can you just
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:09.500]   serve the thing such for signaling it's most of the
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:12.380]   people drink coffee shop. Yeah, most of the people still drink
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:17.820]   milk. Okay, I'm not trying to bring a doing you blue bottle,
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:20.540]   but I'm not going to go to you anymore as a customer because I
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:23.420]   find this stuff really dumb. Like, can you just have milk so
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:26.620]   that I can ask for the milk if I want to versus giving me
[01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:31.820]   chemical stuff that I don't want. I don't want that. Yeah,
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:34.540]   that's and and complaining about oat milk. Is that what's
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:38.620]   going on? No, it's this is where we are moment. It's just
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:41.900]   like, I just want milk. I want a latte. I mean, I want to go
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:44.620]   and support you guys. I want to maybe maybe the cow doesn't
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.940]   want to make that milk for you after its baby was ripped away
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:50.060]   from it. Oh, boy, here we go. You know, here we go. It's day
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:55.020]   we we survive 90 minutes. And here it comes. Point. You know,
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:57.580]   did the cow agree to be in service to you to make your
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:01.420]   milk? You think I need to have a verbal contract with cows? I
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:04.060]   mean, well, yeah, I mean, are we going to do the olive fed beef
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:08.140]   next week or not? Who is the translator of the cow human
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:11.980]   protocol? Who is it? You be boop is one of your friends like
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.380]   what I don't actually I am working on a neural link. I'm
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:17.740]   not sure. I'm not sure that the default assumption that the cow
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:20.380]   should be there to do whatever you want it to do is a fair
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:22.620]   assumption. I think that'll change over time, but it'll take
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:27.020]   some time. I think that that's completely fair and reasonable.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.660]   But what I'm saying is right now while there's an entire
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:34.700]   community said that economy and maybe well, there's an entire
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:37.340]   economy of people that shouldn't get rolled over because you want
[01:34:37.340 --> 01:34:41.660]   to impute the emotions of cows. I'm allowing you your freedom to
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:44.700]   want to impute those emotions of cows. Well, I would like to
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:47.420]   support the dairy industry and buy milk. So can I please do
[01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:49.820]   that? No, I want to impute the freedom and rights of the cows.
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:52.060]   But that's going to take some time. But sure, go ahead. Have
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:55.020]   your milk for now. And you're allowed but I right now will
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:58.300]   take the side of the dairy farmer. I just want to know.
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:03.180]   Anybody get your chick Karen outrage your trim off Karen
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:06.780]   outrage or Karen on tape? Is this trending on TikTok yet?
[01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:09.900]   When you admonished the barista?
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:14.620]   It's not the fault. I just think it's I didn't make a scene or
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:18.460]   anything. I just got I tasted because I just said, Can I please
[01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:21.580]   have a latte, assuming that it would come with milk like most
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:25.020]   most normal places? Yes. And now I have to actually ask for
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:29.100]   milk because they think that this chemical composite stuff
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:31.100]   that's called Oh, have you looked at the ingredients? And
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.500]   don't we have this conversation? Yes, we we got we as anybody
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:36.940]   listen, we didn't even get to MailChimp CEO, Ben chestnut,
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:39.500]   who is, you know, like one of the kind great CEOs of our
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:44.620]   generation. Getting Yeah, his memo. His last name really
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:47.340]   chestnut. I believe it is. Yeah, it's just there's a nice
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:49.980]   chestnut is a great guy. I've met him so many times.
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:53.100]   Incredibly human. And he's been ousted. Should we do outros
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:55.340]   because you didn't do intros? Jekyll? Did you have? All right.
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:59.340]   So here's the actual Yeah, for for the Sultan of science, the
[01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:04.060]   queen of quinoa himself. Climbing the stray cat leader
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:07.500]   board as we speak. David Friedberg follow him on his
[01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:10.220]   Twitter handle where you can get all kinds of hot takes from
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:14.940]   science to Ukraine at Friedberg is the hand talking about I
[01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:19.340]   never tweet. I know that's the joke. Also with with us again,
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:22.220]   the anchor he'll be doing a twitch streaming where he
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:25.980]   translates the emotions. I'm actually doing various animals,
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:29.980]   my cooking show, which has a base of oat milk. It's my oat
[01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:34.220]   milk top 10 beverages tonight on Twitch. Just follow stray
[01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:36.860]   Friedberg get it. I don't want to get Brigadoon by the oat
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:40.380]   milk lovers, but they're coming. Milk stands are coming for you,
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:43.980]   man. You listen, I don't want that chemical stuff in my body,
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:45.820]   but I'm not going to stop you from doing it. I'll do a
[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:49.820]   diatribe on chemicals in oat milk next week. What should we
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:51.900]   drink if you did have a choice? Friedberg if you didn't want to
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.140]   drink the chemicals in a holy, what would you drink? What would
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:58.700]   you what do you drink? Soy milk, oat milk, whatever. Okay,
[01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:04.380]   but you okay, but you're okay. And bringing that namaste
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:09.020]   tasted milk. I drink the beautiful glass jar. No, I'm
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:14.220]   asking Friedberg. I'm strong milk. Yes. $3 returns for each
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:18.220]   glass bottle. I return them. I get them good. Have you tried
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:20.300]   Have you tried? I'll tell you what is going to happen in the
[01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:25.100]   next he's never had milk in the next 10 to 15 years. Most of
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:30.700]   the milk you buy at the store will be identical to cow's milk.
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:34.780]   Same protein composition. It will be built in a slurry. I
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:37.100]   mean, you can make fun of it being a thing, J Cal, but you
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:39.980]   do work in the tech industry. But yeah, I mean, precision
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:43.500]   fermentation is the future of making animal proteins. And it
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:46.380]   is how we're going to hide you Friedberg. I like it. It's a
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:50.220]   but I'm telling you there is an economic model that will
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:52.460]   work where we're going to that's great. You know, but I'm
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:55.580]   saying between but wait between now and then can I just two
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:58.620]   things. Number one is there's a taste and a flavor profile I've
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:01.180]   grown up with that I would like and I don't think I'm a bad
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:04.140]   person. So I just like to have that and not be made to feel
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:07.580]   guilty about it. Okay. And and and number two, I don't want to
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:10.940]   put chemicals in my body. Okay. So if I can find a natural
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:13.820]   thing that I like, can I please just drink that? Can I just
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:16.700]   please blue bottle have that in my coffee without having to
[01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:20.460]   explicitly asked for it? Yes, you will get that. And number
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:23.420]   two bottles are shortest owned by Nestle and they're the
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:26.620]   largest dairy but Chamath has still has a short on Oatly. So
[01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:29.660]   let's just keep this going for just two more weeks. Okay, let
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:32.220]   me ask you an ethical moral questions. I'm joking. He does
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:34.140]   not have a short I don't even know if at least public. I'd
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:36.220]   rather you ask me an ethical moral question than a political
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:38.140]   one. So I'm all I'm going to Yeah, I mean, we got a break
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:43.180]   from Ukraine this week. Would you have a if the synthetic
[01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:49.820]   version of milk or steak was made? Like an is a protein that
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:53.100]   is exactly the same to a cow? Would you have a problem morally
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:56.860]   with eating and or drinking it? No. So the objective of what's
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:59.180]   called precision fermentation, or some people call it
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:03.820]   biomanufacturing, you take the DNA from the cow, or from the
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:07.340]   chicken, you put it in a yeast cell, or a bacterial cell and
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:10.380]   you put in a fermenter tank, you put sugar water in the tank,
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:13.100]   and the yeast cell or bacterial cell eats that sugar water and
[01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:16.780]   it spits out that protein. Yeah, you've programmed that
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:19.580]   organism to make that protein. And instead of growing a whole
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:22.460]   cow or growing a whole friggin chicken, you're growing the
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:24.940]   protein. No moral issue. No moral issue. I got it. Because
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:27.020]   no animal died in the making of the process. You know, you're
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:32.700]   not thinking can I quote Dave Chappelle here? Go ahead. Yuck.
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:35.660]   Alright, it's gonna it's it's identical to the protein you'd
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:39.100]   be eating. Otherwise, it's the same. It's the exact same
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.740]   compound. Oh, there's nothing about it that's different. And
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:44.140]   thanks to the dictator. Thanks to the Southern science and for
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:48.220]   the fifth bestie coming in and doing a great job today on
[01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:53.980]   behalf of our friend, the sass hole David Sachs, who is busy
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:59.580]   in a secret clandestine peace making junket to Ukraine. I am
[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:02.140]   the world's greatest moderator Jason Calacanis. We'll see you
[01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:04.300]   next time on all in. Love you boys.
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:12.300]   Let your winners ride. Rain Man David Sachs.
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:15.960]   And it said we open source it to the fans and they've just
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:20.680]   gone crazy with it. Love you. I'm the queen of
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.560]   what your winners are.
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.440]   Besties are gone. That's my dog taking a notice in your
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:37.880]   driveway. Oh, man. We should all just get a room and just
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:40.520]   have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless. It's
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.920]   like this like sexual tension that they just need to release
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:45.320]   somehow.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:50.120]   Your feet.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.160]   I'm going all in.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:02.540]   I'm going all in.
