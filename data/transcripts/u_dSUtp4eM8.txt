[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740]   Less than 24 hours ago Google released the Palm 2 technical report. I have read all 92 pages,
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.340]   watched the Palm 2 presentation, read the release notes and have already tested the model in a
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.300]   dozen ways. But before getting into it all my four main takeaways are these. First Palm 2 is
[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.200]   competitive with GPT-4 and while it is probably less smart overall it's better in certain ways
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.500]   and that surprised me. Second Google is saying very little about the data it used to train the
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.680]   model or about parameters or about compute although we can make educated guesses on each.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.160]   Third Gemini was announced to be in training and will likely rival GPT-5 while arriving earlier
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.680]   than GPT-5. As you probably know Sam Altman said that GPT-5 isn't in training and won't be for a
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.180]   long time. Fourth while dedicating 20 pages to bias, toxicity and mischief, the Palm 2 is a
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.480]   There wasn't a single page on AI impacts more broadly. Google boasted of giving Gemini
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.420]   planning abilities in a move that, surprised as I am to say it, makes open AI look like
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.740]   paragons of responsibility. So a lot to get to but let's look at the first reason that Palm 2
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.640]   is different from GPT-4. On page 3 they say we designed a more multilingual and diverse
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.160]   pre-training mixture extending across hundreds of languages and domains like programming,
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.160]   mathematics etc.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.940]   So because the text that they train Palm 2 on is different to the text that open AI trained GPT-4 on
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.900]   it means that those models have different abilities and I would say Palm 2 is better at translation
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.540]   and linguistics and in certain other areas which I'll get to shortly. If that's data what about
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.760]   parameter count? Well Google never actually say. They only use words like it's significantly
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.140]   smaller than the largest Palm model which was 540 billion parameters. Sometimes they say
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.140]   significantly, other times dramatically. Despite this it significantly outperforms Palm on a variety
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.360]   of tasks. So all the references you may have seen to imminent 100 trillion parameter models were bogus.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.040]   Skipping ahead to page 91 out of 92 in the model summary they say further details of model size and
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.800]   architecture are withheld from external publication. But earlier on they did seem to want to give hints
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.120]   about the parameter count inside Palm 2 which open AI never did. Here they say that the parameter count
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.780]   is the optimal number of parameters given a certain amount of compute flops. Scaling this up to the
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.580]   estimated number of flops used to train Palm 2 that would give an optimal parameter count of between
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:45.120]   100 and 200 billion. That is a comparable parameter count to GPT-3 while getting competitive performance
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.840]   with GPT-4. BARD is apparently now powered by Palm 2 and the inference speed is about 10 times faster
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.100]   than GPT-4 for the exact same parameter count. So that's a lot of parameters that are being used to train Palm 2.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.160]   And I know there are other factors that influence inference speed but that would
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.860]   broadly fit with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. This has other implications of course
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.580]   and they say that Palm 2 is dramatically smaller, cheaper and faster to serve. Not only that Palm 2
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.980]   itself comes in different sizes as Sundar Pichai said. Palm 2 models deliver excellent foundational
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.080]   capabilities across a wide range of sizes. We have affectionately named them Gecko, Order,
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:33.660]   Bison and Unicorn. Gecko is so lightweight that it can work on mobile devices fast enough for great
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.280]   interactive applications on device even when offline. I would expect Gecko to soon be inside
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.000]   the Google Pixel phones. Going back to data Google cryptically said that their pre-training corpus
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.320]   is composed of a diverse set of sources, documents, books, code, mathematics and conversational data.
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.960]   This is a very common data issue that these companies face but suffice to say they're not saying anything about where the data comes from.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.240]   Next they don't go into detail but they do say that Palm 2 was trained to increase the context
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.240]   length of a model significantly beyond that of Palm. As of today you can input around 10,000
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.000]   characters into BARD but they end this paragraph with something a bit more interesting. They say
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.040]   without demonstrating "Our results show that it is possible to increase the context length of the
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.040]   model without hurting its performance on generic benchmarks."
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.020]   The bit about not hurting performance is interesting because in this experiment published a few weeks ago
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.820]   about extending the input size in tokens up to around 2 million tokens the performance did drop
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.820]   off. If Google had found a way to increase the input size in tokens and not affect performance
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.700]   that would be a breakthrough. On multilingual benchmarks notice how the performance of Palm 2
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.420]   in English is not dramatically better than in other languages. In fact in many other languages
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.020]   it does better than in English.
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.340]   This is very different to GPT-4 which was noticeably better in English than in all other languages.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:08.140]   As Google hinted earlier this is likely due to the multilingual text data that Google trained Palm 2 with.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:15.420]   In fact on page 17 Google admit that the performance of Palm 2 exceeds Google Translate for certain languages.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:25.000]   And they show on page 4 that it can pass the mastery exams across a range of languages like Chinese, Japanese, Italian, French, Spanish, German etc.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.940]   Look at the difference between Palm 2 and Palm in red.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.020]   Now before you rush off and try BARD in all of those languages I tried that and apparently
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.020]   you can only use BARD at the moment in the following languages: English, US English what a pity,
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.620]   and Japanese and Korean.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.260]   But I was able to test BARD in Korean on a question translated via Google Translate from
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.980]   the MMLU dataset. It got the question right in each of its drafts. In contrast GPT-4 not only
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:01.000]   got the question wrong in Korean when I originally tested it for my Smart GPT video it got the
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.480]   question wrong in English.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.460]   In case any of my regular viewers are wondering I am working very hard on Smart GPT to understand
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.800]   what it's capable of and getting it benchmarked officially.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.480]   And thank you so much for all the kind offers of help in that regard.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.360]   I must admit it was very interesting to see on page 14 a direct comparison between Palm
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.960]   2 and GPT-4. And Google do admit for the Palm 2 and GPT-4
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.880]   results they use chain of thought prompting and self consistency. Reading the self consistency
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.440]   paper did remind me quite a lot actually of Smart GPT where it picks the most consistent
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.540]   answer of multiple outputs. So I do wonder if this comparison is totally fair if Palm
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.900]   2 used this method and GPT-4 didn't.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.840]   I'll have to talk about these benchmarks more in another video otherwise this one would
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.940]   be too long. But a quick hint is that Winogrand is about identifying what the pronoun in a
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.060]   sentence refers to.
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:02.220]   Google also weighed into the emerging abilities debate saying that Palm 2 does indeed demonstrate
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.600]   new emerging abilities. They say it does so in things like multi-step arithmetic problems,
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.440]   temporal sequences and hierarchical reasoning. Of course I'm going to test all of those and
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.320]   have begun to do so already.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.780]   And in my early experiments I'm getting quite an interesting result. Palm 2 gets a lot of
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:24.920]   questions wrong that GPT-4 gets right but it can also get questions right that GPT-4
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.340]   gets wrong. And I must admit it's really weird to see Palm 2 getting really advanced
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.840]   college level math questions right that GPT-4 gets wrong and yet also when I ask it a basic
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.960]   question about prime numbers it gets it kind of hilariously wrong. Honestly I'm not certain
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.920]   what's going on there but I do have my suspicions.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.560]   Remember though that recent papers have claimed that emergent abilities are a mirage so Google
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.900]   begs to differ. When Google put Palm 2 up against GPT-4 in high school mathematics problems it did
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:01.340]   outperform GPT-4. But again it was using an advanced prompting strategy not 100% different
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.820]   from SmartGPT so I wonder if the comparison is quite fair. What about coding? Well again it's
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:12.600]   really hard to find a direct comparison that's fair between the two models. Overall I would
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:19.400]   guess that the specialized coding model of Palm, what they call Palm 2S, is worse than GPT-4.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.880]   It says its pass at one accuracy, as in pass first time, is 37.6%.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:32.860]   Remember the Sparks of AGI paper? Well that gave GPT-4 as having an 82% zero shot pass at one
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:38.540]   accuracy level. However as I talked about in the Sparks of AGI video the paper admits that it could
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:45.620]   be that GPT-4 has seen and memorized some or all of human eval. There is one thing I will give
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.680]   Google credit on which is that their code now sometimes references where it came from. Here is
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.840]   a brief extract from the Google keynote presentation.
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.860]   So let's take a look at the first example.
