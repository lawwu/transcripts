[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   quiet quitting.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   I then went relatively deep on this topic over the weekend for a
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.200]   writing project.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.300]   Something I was writing is for a book chapter for my slow productivity
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.700]   book.
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.500]   I went deep on this topic and did some research about where it started
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.200]   from and how it's being covered and what it's really all about.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.900]   So I figured this was a good excuse today's episode to actually talk
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.500]   about quiet quitting.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:41.800]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 214.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:50.600]   If you're new, this is the show where I answer questions from my
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.700]   audience about both the theory and practice of living and working
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.900]   deeply.
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:04.500]   I'm joined here as always in my Deep Work HQ by my producer, Jesse.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.000]   Jesse, I don't know if you noticed the restaurant that we are above,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.400]   or I should say were above, is out of business.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.900]   Republic?
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.800]   Republic is shut down.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.900]   What happened?
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.100]   Look, I don't want to say it's our fault.
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.000]   I'm just looking at the timeline.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Successful restaurant.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.800]   We move in upstairs.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.600]   Restaurant closes.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.100]   So I don't know.
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.100]   Maybe it's something we're doing.
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.800]   No, I think it was just pandemic, you know, they never really recovered.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.000]   It's a big place.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.900]   We went in there once.
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.500]   It kind of had an awkward layout.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.800]   Yeah, it's a weird space, but I've been there for a long time, maybe
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.600]   five, six years, but they never came.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.100]   I mean, after the pandemic, they were shut down for a while.
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.500]   And then when they came back, they never went all in.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.800]   You see, remember the weird hours, like they weren't doing lunches.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.000]   They were closing at nine.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.600]   They were closed on Monday and Tuesday.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.700]   So it's hard to get help.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.600]   It's hard to get help.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.200]   It's part of a restaurant group here in DC, the Black Group, and I think
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.400]   they only had so much capital and they're focusing it on other places.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.300]   That's too bad.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.500]   Yeah, but I was brainstorming.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.900]   So like, here's the thought experiment.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.600]   I'll get your thoughts.
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.300]   Imagine we had a show that was slightly bigger than ours.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.500]   Let's say a Huberman, Fridman style show that would generate enough
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.800]   revenue that you could cover without breaking a sweat, the lease
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   payment on that space.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.600]   All right.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.900]   So let's say we're in that situation.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.600]   Like we, this is the space below us.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.500]   It's this big, nice space.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.000]   We need to take it over.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.900]   What would we do with that space?
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.800]   What would you do, Jesse?
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   What do you think we should do?
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.600]   I'd probably start bartending and feeding you drinks.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.500]   You would just be bartending during the show.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.600]   You are a really good bartender.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.200]   That could be.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.500]   So your recommendation, so Jesse's recommendation, and the people at
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.300]   Tacoma Park would appreciate this, would be to turn that space into a
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.100]   private bar that basically just served elaborate drinks to a single
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.800]   podcaster.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   Yeah, I don't know what to do with that space.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.900]   I mean, hopefully another restaurant or bar comes in, I suppose.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.100]   But yeah, sad.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.800]   Yeah, sad.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.800]   I should say, speaking of Jesse, if you have not been checking out the
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.700]   YouTube channel that goes with this show, you should.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.400]   He's been doing some really interesting things with the videos.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.900]   So if you look at videos of the full episodes now, there's a nice
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.500]   introduction.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.500]   There's also a pardon the interruption style ticker on the side of the
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.900]   screen.
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.100]   So you can see what questions are coming up and where I am in the
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.300]   questions from the question blocks.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.000]   I think that's nice.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.500]   Some more editing is happening with the video clip.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.300]   So if you're an audio only listener, you might want to check out what
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.200]   this show looks like.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.400]   And you can see that at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.600]   All right, so I'm looking at our show notes here.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.500]   We got two good blocks of questions.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.700]   Looks like later on, I'm also going to introduce a case study, trying to
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.600]   do more of those, actually hear about someone who has applied some of
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.500]   this advice that we talked about and what it looked like.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.800]   As always, I encourage you to submit your own questions.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.400]   There's links right in the show notes.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.700]   You go to a survey, boom, type it in, comes right to us.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.500]   We appreciate any and all questions that you send in.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.000]   All right, so before we get going with those questions, I want to start
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.100]   today as I often do with a deep dive.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.700]   Many of you have been sending me notes and messages and articles about
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.700]   the current workplace related internet trend du jour, which is quiet
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.000]   quitting.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.700]   I then went relatively deep on this topic over the weekend for a writing
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.100]   project.
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.300]   Something I was writing for a book chapter for my slow productivity
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.600]   book.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.400]   I went deep on this topic and did some research about where it started
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.200]   from and how it's being covered and what it's really all about.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.900]   So I figured this was a good excuse today's episode to actually talk
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.500]   about quiet quitting.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.100]   So if you haven't heard of this, this is the timeline I was able to
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.500]   excavate through my research.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.000]   This trend starts on TikTok.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.500]   It starts in July.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.400]   So there is a TikTok username at the time, ZKChillin.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.900]   He has since changed his username, but his name was ZKChillin.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.800]   He posted a 17 second video on TikTok that featured soft piano
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.700]   music playing over a montage of videos.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.400]   There's one of it's him on the subway and then you see a downtown
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.600]   New York City Street and then a residential street and then for some
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.500]   reason a child's automated bubble machine.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.600]   So it has this montage and you hear his voice and I wrote down what he
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   says in that video.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.900]   So he says, "I recently heard about this idea of quiet quitting where
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.000]   you're not quitting your job, but quitting the idea of going above and
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.300]   beyond in your work.
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.000]   Then he goes on a little bit, I won't read the whole thing, to reject
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.400]   hustle culture, to reject the idea that hustle culture demands, which
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.500]   is that your work is your life.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.800]   And he says the reality is that it's not and your worth as a person is
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.800]   not defined by your labor.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.900]   So that TikTok video becomes popular.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.300]   Other TikTok users start posting videos about quiet quitting, in
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.300]   particular lots of profession specific videos.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.500]   So there's a well-known one now that's a teacher talking about the
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.500]   demands of teaching and etc.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.600]   Right?
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.200]   So it becomes a TikTok phenomenon.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.300]   The mainstream media picks it up as far as I can tell early August.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.400]   They pick this up and it has now been covered extensively in the
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.700]   mainstream media and other types of media since then.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.800]   So it jumped from TikTok into mainstream discussion.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.700]   So I'm loading up here on the screen.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.100]   So for those of you who are watching this episode or segment on YouTube,
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.400]   you can actually see the article, but I'll narrate for those who are
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.000]   just listening.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.100]   There is this article from The Guardian on August 6th, which I believe
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.600]   as far as I can tell is one of the first actual old-school media
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.500]   sources to tackle the topic.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.000]   So it was titled "Quiet quitting while doing the bare minimum at work
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.900]   has gone global" and it was written by James Tapper.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.300]   I just want to point out a couple things from this article and then
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.000]   what I want to do is give you my thoughts on all this.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.300]   So this article opens, I just want to point this out by saying Bartleby
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.600]   is back, although no doubt he would prefer not to be.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.800]   This is a very British way to open an article like that.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.100]   There is a book, Melville wrote a short story, I think it's a novella
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.300]   short story, I think it's a short story, maybe novella, called Bartleby
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.200]   the Scrivener.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.500]   It's actually one of the first, as far as I can tell, books about
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.300]   knowledge work on we.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.500]   So check out that book if you haven't seen it.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.500]   But anyways, that's very British. The number of American TikTok users
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.500]   who would know that reference, I'm going to assume is low.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.400]   Alright, so let me jump ahead here.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.200]   Here's another key quote.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.100]   Instead, they are doing just enough in the office to keep up.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.800]   So this is talking about the "quiet quitters" then leaving work
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.900]   on time and muting slack.
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.800]   The writer then adds, kind of snarkily, then posting about it on social
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.000]   media.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.800]   So here is the summary of quiet quitting that this Guardian article
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.300]   gave. They're doing just enough in the office to keep up.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.800]   Then leaving work on time and muting slack.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.300]   Now there's some good analysis in this piece trying to understand
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:34.800]   this trend.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.900]   So here's a quote from an expert. Since the pandemic, people's
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.500]   relationship with work has been studied in many ways and the literature
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.700]   typically across professions would argue that yes, people's way of
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.300]   relating to their work has changed.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.100]   We talk about that often on the show, the impact of the pandemic on
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.200]   people stepping back and saying, wait a second.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.100]   What's going on with my life?
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:55.900]   What's going on with my work?
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.200]   Is a good time to regroup.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.300]   Another quote from this expert.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.300]   The search for meaning has become far more apparent.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.600]   There's a sense of our own mortality during the pandemic.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.900]   Something quite existential around people thinking, what should work
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.500]   mean for me?
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.300]   What can I do in a role?
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.500]   How can I do a role that's more aligned to my values?
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.000]   And finally, we have another quote here from a Harvard Business
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.800]   School professor who introduced this term, "The Great Rethink" as
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.300]   a better way of describing the current moment in knowledge work than
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.700]   something like the Great Resignation.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.900]   There's a lot of rethinking happening.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.600]   All right, so I want to give, let me give some thoughts here.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.700]   First of all, I should go on to say this article, which was one of
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.300]   the first, was one of the better articles on this topic.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.500]   They defined what quiet quitting was and then gave this psychological
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.100]   context.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.100]   What's going on in the workplace?
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.600]   Why might this trend have emerged?
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.300]   Since then, things have been going downhill.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.900]   I do not necessarily suggest getting, looking at the online coverage
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:06.100]   of this topic as I went into it for my, the chapter I was writing.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:11.000]   In the months since this, this idea first arose, I think online
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.700]   discussion and coverage has become a pile on of superficial
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.500]   criticality.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:23.400]   The online commentators are seeing this issue mainly as a chance to
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.000]   prove their sophistication and bona fides by trying to one-up whoever
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.100]   talked about it last by pointing out what they missed.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.800]   You thought this is wrong, but you're the problem because you missed
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.700]   out on this problem and then someone else comes in and I find it to
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.900]   be completely non-useful.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.000]   So you have the original quiet quitters on TikTok and then you get
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.700]   the reaction that's like kids are lazy.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.300]   You know, this is just called having a job.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.200]   What are you talking about?
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.300]   And then you have the crew that comes in and says, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.000]   you both are wrong because what neither of you are doing is cataloging
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.600]   every single identity group and trying to argue which identity
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.400]   groups will have an easier time than worse.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.600]   You have to have a huge appendix trying to rank order the ease with
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.300]   which different groups can do quiet quitting and until you acknowledge
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.500]   that you're the problem that someone else comes in and says no, all
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.800]   of you guys are the problem because what you don't realize is that
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.500]   you're you're bougie stooges and the key here is to rebuild capitalism
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.900]   and replace it with something better.
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.700]   This discussion in general is just part of the super structure that
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.400]   is upholding this economic exploitation.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.600]   Everyone trying to one-up everyone else, everyone else trying to make
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.200]   everyone else seem dumber than them.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.700]   It's a mess.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.300]   It's a pile on ignore it.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.600]   So let's push that aside.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.200]   Let's get rid of the posture and get back to the original issue here
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.100]   of quiet quitting and this context that I think the Guardian provided
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.400]   which I think is quite good.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.700]   So I think there is something important here.
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.000]   What we're seeing in that tick-tock discussion.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.900]   Is a new generation that will call it this pandemic generation the
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.500]   generation that had the pandemic disruptions hit early in their
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.600]   adulthood discovering for lack of a better word lifestyle design.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:03.200]   The idea that work is one of the factors that you can intentionally
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.300]   deploy as part of a larger plan to construct a life that is meaningful
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:07.800]   or deep.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.900]   So it's an intentional approach to life in which you are designing
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:16.000]   your life to meet whatever criteria you have for meaning and depth.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.700]   So it is good to see a new generation discovering this.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.800]   The frustration is is there they're starting from scratch.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.000]   I mean quiet quitting is a it's a simplistic and crude first step
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.900]   towards trying to understand.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.700]   Well, wait a second.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.000]   What role does work have in my life?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.500]   I'm working too much.
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.600]   I don't know why probably because someone's being evil.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.200]   I think I'm going to like work less.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.600]   It's a very simplistic first step towards a deeper more necessary
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.100]   conversation, but this is a topic that has been covered every single
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.600]   generation going back quite a few generations go back to the 19th
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.700]   century read Walden by Thoreau jump forward to the 20th century read
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.900]   the seven-story mountain jump forward another 20 years read Zen and
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.800]   the art of motorcycle maintenance jump forward to the 21st century.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.700]   You can start with eat pray love then go onwards to the four-hour
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.000]   workweek which by the way was covering this exact issue the last
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.200]   time we went through this which was the post 9/11 recession and my
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.800]   generation the early Millennials entering the working world and
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.900]   trying to find their way.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.500]   We had Tim Ferriss's version of lifestyle design.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:30.000]   It's also covered by us here on the show and in my writing extensively
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.300]   when we talk about the deep life and lifestyle centric career planning
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.100]   and career capital and in the the method of intentionally trying to
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.600]   construct a life that is deep and how you have to be systematic and
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.000]   deploy lots of different angles at it.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.300]   So it's it's not a topic.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.400]   We're starting from scratch.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.200]   The tick-tock crew kind of is so I think this is the the good news bad
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.100]   news. The good news is what a topic and I'm glad I think it's a serious
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.100]   topic and I'm glad it's getting attention with this particular group.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.100]   The bad news is look if you start from scratch.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.200]   I don't think you're going to catch up to throw anytime soon like people
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.100]   have thought about this.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.900]   So you should pull from what is already out there.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.900]   So I think this is an important topic.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:15.000]   I'm glad it's being looked at this pandemic generation probably has
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.900]   had the most impetus to look at this topic that we've seen since I
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.200]   don't know.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.100]   Maybe the Zen of the art of motorcycle maintenance sort of 1960s early
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:25.600]   70s.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   That's probably the last time we had a comparable disruption in culture
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.100]   evolution of culture that required a pretty serious re rethinking that
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.300]   eventually by the way led to the 1980s.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.000]   We talked about this recently early 1990s notion of passion and following
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.600]   your passion and the bastardization of Campbell's follow your bliss,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.900]   which has been the mixed bag and we're having another one of these
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:52.500]   evolutions now in the great rethink of induced by the pandemic is going
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:52.700]   on.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.000]   We're trying to rethink these things.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.700]   So I think quiet quitting is reflecting a good trend.
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.800]   Even if the details of these TikTok videos are easy to dismiss, I would
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.100]   say let's resist that urge.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.600]   Yes, if you're going to look at 23 year olds posting 17 second videos,
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.400]   we can make fun.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.700]   We can make ourselves feel smarter than everyone else.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.300]   I think what we should do is see this as an opportunity to help a group
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.200]   a large group of dissatisfied and earnestly searching people.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.100]   Find their way so they don't have to do this all from scratch.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.100]   So my thoughts on quiet quitting Jesse.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.800]   It seems like that would be a topic in both books that you're going to
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.100]   work on.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.700]   Yeah, yes, this little productivity productivity, right?
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.100]   That seems like a even bigger product topic in your next book.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.800]   Yeah, I think the deep life book is going to be a big topic is going to
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.600]   be a good match for this.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.000]   I mean, it's all in the air right now.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.700]   You know, and this happens every generation you get to a place
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.900]   economically things are going good.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.100]   There's other concerns.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:59.000]   You don't really think much about work and then and then once you get
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.200]   going something happens and you're like, well, what role is work supposed
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:03.700]   to have my life?
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.900]   What's going on here and people try to figure this out.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.700]   So a slow productivity, how does it relate?
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.700]   Well, I mean, I think slow productivity is maybe a little bit more.
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:21.100]   Narrow in its attack on this topic, but slow productivity is saying what
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.700]   even are you going for when you say you want to be productive?
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.600]   Like what is your definition of a working life?
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.500]   Well executed and the argument there is that we we have these we don't
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:32.900]   think it through.
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.400]   We have these superficial definitions.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:34.800]   I don't know.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.000]   Busyness is better than less hustling is better than not hustling.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.200]   I want to feel like I'm earning my keep but it's all very haphazard and
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.200]   a lot of what we actually do when we're trying to get after it quote
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.300]   unquote in our work is ironically counterproductive makes us more
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:51.800]   miserable.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.800]   It's not maximizing useful output and so slow productivity is saying
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.500]   why don't we go back and rethink what we even mean by productivity,
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.300]   especially when it comes to knowledge work to try to find something
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.300]   that's more sustainable.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.200]   That's going to make life more meaningful and it all is going to
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:05.800]   produce better stuff.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:11.400]   So it's like a narrow first stab at the great rethink and then the deep
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.100]   life is much broader.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.600]   The deep life is where you say, you know what we're going to move to
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.000]   Kentucky.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.400]   So quiet quitting kind of helps like define it and then from there.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.100]   Yeah, quiet quitting or quiet quitting is a response to the same
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.900]   underlying impetus that my books are coming out of which is people
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.200]   starting to rethink work.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.800]   It's rolling their life and what they're trying to do with their life
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.400]   more generally.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Alright, we got a couple good blocks of questions here.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.100]   First, I want to talk about a new sponsor to the show that I'm excited
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:37.300]   about.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.200]   And that is Henson shaving.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.800]   This is the type of this is the type of thing I like.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.100]   Okay.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.000]   So here's the here's the idea here.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I'm going to have a script but let me let me cut to the idea of what
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   I'm really excited about here.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.200]   This is a family-run business that specialize in really high-precision
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.100]   parts manufacturing for the aerospace industry.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.100]   So they have manufactured pieces for the Mars Rovers.
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.400]   They've manufactured pieces for the International Space Station.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.200]   They use these high-precision CNC routers that can build things to
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.800]   really precise specifications.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.000]   So they had this idea.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.200]   They're looking at the world of shaving.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.900]   What they figured out is the problem in the world of shaving is the way
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.500]   the razors are mounted.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:29.200]   If the razors are loose or too much of it is exposed it bends up and
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:29.300]   down.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.400]   It's like a diving board.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.500]   It moves up and down and that's what catches your skin.
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.000]   That's what causes irritation and nicks.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.600]   And so they realized if you could build a really precise razor body.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.500]   So the actual handle and thing at the end of the razor that could hold a
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.800]   standard razor blade perfectly.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:55.200]   Firmly with with just the right amount showing then the blades become the
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:55.800]   easy part.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.200]   10 cent standard blade is fine.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.600]   All of the magic is in getting the precisely built handle and that's what
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.000]   they did.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   They designed this beautiful precision-generated metal shaving handle
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.700]   that you use with just standard 10 cent razor blades and get a incredible
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.400]   shave out of it.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.800]   So the way they explained it to me is they built a great razor and a terrible
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.700]   razor business.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:26.800]   So unlike the subscription services, unlike the disposable razors where you
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.900]   know, the whole business is we're going to keep selling you these high-priced
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:35.000]   poorly made razors that blades that you use for a while and throw out here you
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.400]   buy this one really nice handle and then you know for 10 bucks you can have two
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.800]   years worth of blades.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.300]   The blades are no longer the easy part.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.400]   So I like this idea of super high-quality precisely made beautiful objects that
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.300]   do a job really well.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.000]   You don't have to have all the plastic and all the waste.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.200]   You have this nice piece of aluminum and you use just standard blades and you
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.000]   get a really good shave.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.900]   Their precision is .0013 inches.
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.300]   That's how far their blades extend.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.400]   That's less than the thickness of a human hair.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   You can't do that unless you know how to make super precise parts.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.000]   So I am a I was a fan of this of this company.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.800]   I have my Henson's shaver.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.700]   It's fantastic.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.700]   Now you pay more for the thing up front, but you're not buying the replacement
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:20.900]   blades.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:21.900]   You're not doing the subscriptions.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.500]   You're not doing the going to CVS and getting the things in the plastic box that
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.200]   they have to come and unlock to whatever you buy the thing once and you use it
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.200]   with 10 cents blades.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:37.000]   You you will be winning in terms of how much you paid really soon.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.800]   So I don't know.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.700]   I mean, this is one of these things where I'm actually a big fan of the product.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.900]   So here's the thing.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.000]   It's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.300]   lifetime.
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:55.600]   Visit Henson shaving.com / Cal to pick the razor for you and then use the code
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:00.800]   Cal and you will get two years worth of blades free with your razor.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:06.600]   Now the key here is when you go to the site you choose your razor add the two
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.800]   year supply of razors to your cart.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.200]   And then when you enter the code Cal it'll just make them free, but you have to
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.100]   you have to add the razors to your cart and then enter the code Cal when you
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.500]   check out and you'll get the two years worth of razors for free.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:28.300]   That's 100 free blades when you head to Henson shaving.com / Cal and use that
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.700]   code Cal.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:36.200]   So I was on the phone with them Jesse right before earlier today and I knew I
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.800]   had to get over here and I had to restrain myself because I wanted to shave
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.700]   but I had a lot of questions about the high precision CNC routers.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.000]   I'm like does it start with a block of aluminum?
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.300]   Like how do these things work?
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.500]   It's it's you know, because it's a cylindrical like precision made thing.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.800]   I'm just really interested in that technology.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.700]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:00.200]   I also thought it was cool that the thing that built my razor also built
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.200]   parts for the International Space Station.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.600]   So that's cool.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.200]   I also want to talk about speaking of well-made really interesting
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.300]   high-tech products.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.800]   I also want to talk about 8 Sleep.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.300]   This is I think again really cool technology.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.100]   I like seeing really cool technologies.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:26.800]   So the 8 Sleep pod is they call it the ultimate sleep machine.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.300]   But what it does is a sleep technology that can control the temperature of
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.600]   your sleeping experience.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.900]   You put the pod over your mattress and you have precise control over what
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:41.800]   temperature you then want that mattress cover to be at.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.100]   So the way I use it why I like this product like most people like this
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.900]   product is you can bring the temperature down.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.400]   It's hard to get a good night's sleep if you're hot.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.900]   And if you bring the temperature down with your 8 Sleep pod to be just a
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.800]   little bit cooler the quality of your sleep significantly improves.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.200]   You can bring it down as cold as 55 degrees.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   I was thinking about 8 Sleep, Jesse the other day I was watching reruns of
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.300]   Curb Your Enthusiasm.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:19.500]   And there's a lot like the later seasons where he's arguing with his
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.100]   girlfriend, I forgot her name, about the temperature they sleep in and she
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.800]   likes it warmer and he likes it cooler.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.500]   But the premise is like eventually she gets sick and he's going to have to
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.100]   care for her and he was trying to break up with her before she got sick and
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:32.800]   he just missed it.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.400]   But then the doctor is there and the doctor is like and this is really
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.100]   important.
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.300]   You're going to have to really keep the room warm.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.100]   You know, I think it's gonna be really important for the healing
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:43.600]   process.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.400]   You really I think for sleeping need the room to be 80-85 degrees.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.700]   I thought that was funny.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.800]   The 8 Sleep would be just what he needs there, what Larry David needed
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.100]   because he could bring his side of the bed down.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.800]   So there's data about this 8 Sleep users experience up to 19% increase
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:03.600]   recovery up to 32% improvement in sleep quality 34% more deep sleep.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.200]   Their newest generation is called the Pod 3 which allows you to do
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:08.900]   tracking.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.700]   You can track sleep, track health with the sensors, health tracking, you
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.700]   see sensors that are in there.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.900]   So it's getting pretty high-tech, but mainly it really is a game-changer
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.300]   to go to bed and the thing you're on is not hot.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.400]   The Pod is not magic, but it can feel like it.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:31.800]   So go to 8sleep.com/deep to start sleeping cool and save $150 on the
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.300]   Pod.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:37.000]   That's 8 Sleep spelled out E-I-G-H-T sleep.com/deep.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.400]   8 Sleep currently ships within the US, Canada, and the UK as well as
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.800]   select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.900]   Alright, so let's get into some questions.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.400]   Jesse, what's our first question of the day?
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.700]   Okay, so our first question is from Esther.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.100]   She's a 48 year old physician in New York City.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.700]   This is what she has to say.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.500]   What did your parents do in your childhood and teen life to help
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.700]   motivate you to be as organized and efficient as you are?
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.600]   What lessons can I learn to motivate my teenagers to pursue excellence
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.700]   and all that they do?
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.700]   Well, it's an interesting question.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:24.200]   So if I go back in time to think about young Cal Newport and what he
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.300]   was exposed to growing up, I mean, there is some interesting stuff to
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.900]   perhaps mine from back then.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.500]   My mom is very organized.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:36.300]   I mean, she'll tell this story that she wasn't organized.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.000]   We were very young.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.800]   She was not as organized and we lived in Houston.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:45.300]   It was kind of a hectic setup because she had to commute from north
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.300]   of Houston in the downtown.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.500]   It was a very long commute and then my dad had to go the other
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.300]   direction and we're always cobbling together childcare and I think
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.200]   it was a little busy and then we moved to New Jersey and once we
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.100]   moved to New Jersey, we were old enough that she was staying at home
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.700]   at that point and I think it was very stressful and chaotic to try
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.800]   to organize the lives of four elementary school age kids, but she
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.500]   had a friend she met.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:15.200]   She had a friend who was Mormon who really pushed the Franklin
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.300]   Covey system, right?
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.300]   Because a cubby is Mormon.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:23.100]   So the Franklin Franklin Covey system, which is based on part on
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:27.600]   Stephen Coven, Stephen Covey's thinking was very popular among
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.200]   Mormons before it expanded to be more popular generally.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.900]   So my mom became a like a diehard user of the Franklin planner, like
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.500]   using it the way exactly following the rules and it transformed life.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.800]   So it killed off that stress.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.400]   It was a very organized household.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.800]   So I was exposed to that.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.200]   So subliminally I might have taken in organization helps, but I was
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.800]   not a very organized structured kid.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.500]   I was haphazard.
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.000]   I would leave things until the last minute.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.100]   I was not a kind of type A.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:03.100]   Let's get things lined up tackle them one by one get things done
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.300]   at the highest level of quality.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.500]   I was not like that until college.
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:11.200]   I really wasn't until college when I got serious about my academic
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.200]   career that I began to get more systematic about organization because
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.700]   at that point I cared.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.900]   It was not really till then that I cared how well I did my options in
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.500]   life for whatever reason.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.700]   I don't quite know why I had a chip on my shoulder.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.400]   You know, I just had this sense of I think I have some talent.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:37.000]   I think I'm a smart guy, but it's on me to make something of this.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.300]   I don't know where that came from.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.000]   But that sense did not emerge for me until college and then I got
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.400]   very organized and structured and developed the type of ideas I talk
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:44.800]   about here.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.200]   So I don't know if I subliminally took in some things from my mom
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.200]   growing up that I then put into action once I was ready to put into
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:57.600]   action or if it was unrelated, but it certainly wasn't I'm 12 and
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.000]   really good at planning things.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.100]   So from a parenting perspective, what this what this is telling me is
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:10.900]   you probably cannot engineer a child into being more organized in the
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.900]   being more driven.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.000]   You can demonstrate it in your own life.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.600]   You can demonstrate the benefits of a structured life less stress
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.200]   more control more opportunity more options things in general are more
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.800]   interesting less chaotic.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.900]   I think kids do pick up they appreciate the stability.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.100]   They will pick up the stability.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.100]   So that might be something that is actually imprinted.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.700]   It's a sort of a show-don't-tell strategy.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:42.900]   I do also think it's important to talk with kids, you know, specifically
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:48.100]   about building intentionally a life a deeper life.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.900]   These things matter discipline is important for this reason.
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.500]   It's how you make the most of the talents you have the opportunities
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.000]   you have and make the most of your time here knowing what's what you
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.300]   want in life is important engineering around that's important.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.200]   Here's why we live here.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.300]   Here's why we have these jobs.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.300]   Here's why we left this we really think about this.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.600]   Here's why community is important.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.800]   You know, I spend all this time volunteering over here is because I
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.200]   think it's important to serve other people being really clear.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.800]   About the elements what makes a life deep I think is again probably
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.300]   very important not that they will then say yes dad.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.000]   Yes mom.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.900]   I'm going to start doing this tomorrow, but they remember that lessons
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.100]   when they get to a place where they realize oh, I'm on my own.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.600]   I got to figure myself out.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:30.800]   You got to figure out what to do and they can look back and say here's
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.700]   an option to try what my parents did what seemed to be working for
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.000]   them what they explained to me and taught to me.
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.700]   Now I am ready 1920 21 years old now.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.900]   I'm ready to try this out.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.000]   And so there might be this period of frustration where you're you're
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.300]   demonstrating through your actions.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.000]   You're you just through conversation.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.900]   You're explaining what you figured out over time as an adult about how
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.500]   to approach life and you're not seeing it reflected in their day-to-day
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:54.800]   action.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.500]   You're like man if I was 17, I'd be doing this so much better, but it's
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.800]   still useful what you're doing because it's it's it's giving this option
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.900]   into their toolbox.
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.600]   So when they're ready to start pulling tools for the toolbox, which will
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.300]   be out of sight of you after they're out of the home.
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:12.100]   It'll be in there and they might be more likely to pick it up.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:17.100]   The other thing I would recommend is you have to resist.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:26.400]   You have to resist the the appeal of using your kids as a proxy for your
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.700]   own accomplishments.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.600]   This is a big DC area thing.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.500]   I think this is true in other major cities as well.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.500]   I'd be interested from our international listeners how common this is.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:43.300]   It's so easy if you're like a relatively accomplished adult who has kids
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:48.900]   and you look at your kids and say, you know, the competitive structures
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.100]   where they exist what's required to stand out man.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.900]   That's not so hard from the perspective of an adult as compared to like
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.000]   trying to get partner at this law firm that I did.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.700]   And so let me just push these kids into accomplishments that are visible
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.000]   and impressive and by proxy that will reflect well on me and you get a
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.700]   lot of this now parents are saying my kids and their accomplishments
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.400]   are going to reflect well on me and you know what?
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.000]   It's a lot easier to have them do the work than me have to do the work.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.400]   It's a lot easier to say, you know, go back there and keep practicing
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.300]   the clarinet than it is to actually have to practice it yourself and
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.300]   you use the kids as a proxy for your own accomplishment.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.000]   This I think is a problem.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.400]   I used to study this in a lot more detail in my 20s when I was doing
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.500]   more work on student stress.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.700]   High school student stress was an area that I used to give talks on
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.000]   and do a lot of writing on and there's a real problem with this
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.700]   approach.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.400]   What happens is is you can burn out the motivational drive of your
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:42.800]   kid.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:48.500]   So they get turned off on this idea this extrinsic motivation of like
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.000]   man, it's go go go if you got to do everything at the highest level.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.100]   Why don't you have the highest grade your parents are getting a real
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.100]   kick out of hey, you got to the most advanced, you know, you're in
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.200]   the most advanced reading group.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.100]   You're on the best select team.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.700]   You're the first chair and the whatever and they're getting all
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.800]   this this whatever this energy out of it.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   They feel like it reflects well in them and you're burning out the
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.500]   kids motivation drive and then they're going to go through some sort
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.400]   of simplistic rebellion where when they're looking at their options
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.000]   a sort of more intentional careful discipline, which is really
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   important to life.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.900]   They're not going to pull that option on their toolbox.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.900]   It's like I did the like discipline thing when I was 17 and it burned
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:29.900]   me out and now that I'm you know, I made it to whatever.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.300]   Brown I'm going to go the opposite direction.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.300]   And it's not great.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.800]   So I'm just going to throw in that thing you want to demonstrate
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.100]   the intentional construction of a life that includes discipline
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:43.700]   organization.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.400]   You want to talk about it why it's important but don't I mean the
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.100]   kid has to pull it out of the toolbox themselves and they might not
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.600]   be ready to pull it out when they're 17 and if you force them too
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.800]   hard to do it, you might and I don't want to stretch this metaphor,
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   but you might end up breaking that tool early and then they won't
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.500]   have it when they need it later on in life.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:06.400]   When you you coach a lot Jesse, I don't know what you see but yeah,
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.700]   like sports culture around here.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.100]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.200]   No, you nailed it.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.600]   I mean though you work with some fantastic athletes.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.800]   I mean, I think it's a difference if it's you're really gifted,
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.200]   you know athletically for example, so like let's let's foster that
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.800]   and like really make that a part of your life, but there's this
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.600]   whole second tier of you know, young people athletes where it's
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.400]   like you don't really need to be away every weekend at these
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:28.900]   tournaments.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.800]   You don't really need private coach like it's fine, but you're
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.000]   not you're not going to play d1 college.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.900]   Yeah, so so why is your why are you spending so much time and
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.600]   saying other than I you can get addicted as a parent to the like
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:46.400]   we're on this team and we got selected for that team and every
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.100]   time that happens you as the parent somehow it makes you feel
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.100]   like physically stronger for sure.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.100]   There's some pretty intense parents out there as well.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:58.700]   Yeah that you know push a lot and it can be difficult for like
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.800]   the head coach to because they're always do you have parent?
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.400]   Well, I don't want you to talk out of school, but just abstractly
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.200]   speaking do parents parents interacting with head coaches or
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.800]   something that was very common at the high school level very
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.200]   common.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.400]   Even common at their college level like there's like college
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.100]   coaches that I couldn't have to deal with some parents for sure
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:23.800]   that baffles me as someone who did a little bit of d1 college
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.300]   athletics.
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:30.000]   I couldn't imagine a parent coming in to definitely exist.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.700]   Oh my goodness.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.900]   Well, hey, look I had if this helps I had none of that growing
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.200]   up.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.600]   I think we had a lot of kids and it was busy and we had good
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.200]   structure and we had good routine and good role models and our
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:46.500]   parents but like I we were we were never at least I wasn't
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.900]   there was never this thing of this particular activity you're
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:50.500]   doing.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.300]   Why can't we be doing this at a higher level?
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.900]   You know and it and it worked out.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.500]   Okay for me.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:00.200]   But everyone is going to have to look into their toolbox of how
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.500]   do I build my life at some point and I'm just just my theory
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.000]   make sure the right tools are in there and don't be frustrated
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.700]   that they're not ready to open the box at 15 and 16 some kids
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.800]   are but some kids aren't.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.900]   All right.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:11.700]   What do we have next Jesse?
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.100]   All right.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.100]   Next question is from Max.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:19.900]   He's a 40 year old marketer from London and he says I've been
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.300]   asked to start writing regular articles for my company.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.400]   I'm struggling with this assignment.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.100]   I cannot find my voice when I write I come across as very
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.600]   rigid and contrived.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.200]   How do you write your articles?
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.500]   That's a good question.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:38.100]   How do you actually craft an article?
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.000]   It seems like it's a easy thing.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.200]   They're not that long.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.000]   It's not a book but more than a few people like you Max have
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.900]   faced the reality when it comes time to write what needs to be
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.700]   a smart good article in this case representing your company
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.100]   that it's hard to do.
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.200]   You don't know where to start.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.100]   So, you know, I have some tips to share.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:02.200]   Let me let me just start with the preface of I have been writing
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:06.500]   professionally, you know for over two decades and it's all I
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:06.700]   do.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.600]   All I do is write I write every single day.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.600]   My key I showed you on the show last week.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.500]   My keyboard is completely worn away after just a couple years
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.200]   of use because of how much I write I write academic articles.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.800]   I write public consumption magazine articles.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.500]   I write books.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.000]   I write essays every week for my own newsletter.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.100]   And so I've been working at this for a really long time.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.800]   So I only say that just as a preface that don't don't let's
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.500]   say read one of my recent articles and say why doesn't my
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.000]   stuff just sound like this?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   What's wrong?
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.900]   There's 20 years of work that goes behind that.
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.500]   So it's a it's a process you get better and better with work.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.400]   So I'm going to start there so that you're not and forget.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.200]   Okay, maybe don't use me as an example.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.200]   I don't want you reading, you know, John McPhee and saying
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.300]   why don't I sound like that?
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.300]   He spent a lifetime honing that ability.
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.300]   I do have some specific advice that I wrote down a few things
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:37:02.200]   here about article writing one spend more time thinking
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.800]   through your idea your thesis before you write preferably
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.100]   do this on foot.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.000]   I think interesting articles good writers spend a lot more
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.600]   time thinking about the point they want to make and the pieces
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.500]   that go into that point.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.300]   They spend a lot more time thinking about that than you might
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.900]   realize. I think amateur writers get started too quickly.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.900]   And especially for an idea article, you're not going to figure
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:24.700]   out on the page.
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.000]   There might be passages you figure out on the page.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.200]   Like let me just go for this and then see if it's working
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.000]   or not, but you're not going to figure out here is my big
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.500]   point or the thesis and the four things to support it that
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.700]   has to be done on foot and it can take a long time to get
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.100]   there. You could try and not like what you have and you have
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.800]   to keep thinking before you start writing.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.500]   All right number two for this style of article you'll be
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.100]   writing and I can see from your elaboration.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:54.000]   It's it's like a philosophical angle on ideas related to
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.800]   the products your company builds.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.700]   So for that type of philosophical idea type article start
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.200]   with a standard structure at first.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:05.600]   I think it's a good good way to enter into professional
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.400]   article writing.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.700]   So there's a you know, one of the standard structure is going
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:12.800]   to be you know, you open on a illustrative example that leads
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.900]   to the nut graphs.
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:17.500]   This is where you're actually explaining here is the idea.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.800]   I'm going to try to convince you of in this piece and now
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.700]   you suddenly understand what that example that you just
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.400]   read was about.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.300]   So you create a little bit of narrative tension which you
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.600]   relieve partially with the revelation of your thesis.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.100]   Then you go into elaboration.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.600]   All right, let me work through this connection idea.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.100]   Let me support it give you the necessary caveats.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.300]   Now, they have a complete understanding of the idea.
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.200]   The narrative tension has been fully released and then
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:45.500]   your conclusion should pull back have a call back to what
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.800]   you open with and then there's a sense of completion.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.000]   So like that standard idea writing 101 you build up narrative
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   tension and then the release of the tension pulls the reader
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.300]   through the article towards the end and the call back gives
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.300]   them this sort of satisfying sense of completion to the to
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:38:59.900]   the whole story.
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.700]   They just went through similar things happen.
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:07.700]   If you study, you know, Aristotle's poetics and storytelling
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.400]   similar types of structures and goes back a long way three
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:16.200]   show don't tell one of the big differentiators these type
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.500]   of articles between amateur and professional writing is
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:23.200]   to professional writings a lot denser by which I mean, it's
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.400]   points are established with quotes citations of specific
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.100]   examples.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.200]   So it's denser.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.400]   There's a there's a density of citation.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.200]   I don't mean formal, you know, you're doing some sort of
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.000]   AP style citation, but it's you're showing don't telling
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.200]   such and such said this such and such example went for
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.100]   14 years.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:45.600]   Does this car in 1950 at on average this miles per gallon
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.600]   and now by 1990 was this me miles per hour and show don't
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:53.400]   tell related piece of advice number four be wary of the
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.700]   conversational voice.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.500]   All right.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.700]   It's a real temptation.
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.600]   I think when people are new to this type of article writing
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.500]   to ask rhetorical questions and have more colloquial asides
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.800]   of you would think this is the case, but it's not really
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.700]   what would you do if you were suddenly faced with 10 million
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.900]   dollars? Maybe not what you would think if you blah blah
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:16.900]   blah the conversational tone reads amateur it that's more
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.600]   that's more acceptable.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.600]   I think in a sort of personalized blogging world, but
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.800]   you want to avoid the conversational tone.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.000]   So they're like colloquial idiomatic expressions really
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.700]   avoid rhetorical questions except for maybe occasionally
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.400]   and this is my bugaboo.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.500]   I think rhetorical questions and idea writing is you know,
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.900]   it's my version of using cliches.
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.300]   It's I think it's weak writing.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.900]   Don't ask rhetorical question show.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:41.400]   Don't tell show.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.700]   Don't tell move it forward.
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.200]   And then finally don't write for the sake of writing.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.400]   It really comes through an article writing as well as book
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.000]   chapter writing.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.100]   You see this a lot when people are writing books that maybe
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:52.900]   they're not writers.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.600]   It's a it's based on their expertise is you're like man.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.300]   I know that you know how many words this chapter needs to
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:03.400]   be and you are trying to get to that word count that comes
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.300]   through really clearly.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.100]   That's what I call writing for the sake of writing.
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.700]   Like there's no real reason for the last two paragraphs to
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.800]   be here other than you're trying to get to 2,000 words.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:15.900]   Professional writers look to pull the ripcord on whatever
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.800]   passage idea or paragraph they're working on as soon as
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.400]   possible.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.700]   The sooner I can get out of this the more comfortable I am
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:23.000]   with this.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.500]   So go back and read, you know, some New Yorker articles and
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.000]   you'll see this they're they're out of the they're out of
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.100]   each argument as quickly as they can like what's the essence
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.300]   of what I'm trying to say here.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.900]   You know, we psyched us is different than this.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.000]   We also see it here ripcord.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.600]   I'm out next thing you don't see this dragging out of like,
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.400]   you know, and maybe this and maybe that and let me rhetorical
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.700]   question here and and let's go back and summarize and so
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.600]   when you're writing record, I actually in the slow productivity
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:53.800]   book.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.100]   I'm writing now my the voice.
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:00.900]   I'm using that book is is it's I don't know the right way
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.200]   to describe it, but I'm really trying to non over elaborate
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:05.400]   things.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   I guess it's a little bit more not enigmatic but a little
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.400]   bit more declarative because it's it's it's supposed to have
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.900]   a sense of some timeless wisdom.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.200]   I literally on multiple occasions when I'm editing something
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.600]   have written ripcord ripcord ripcord as a reminder to myself
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.600]   like get out get out get the point get out get the point
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   get out the reader smart to fill in the details.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.900]   Don't over explain.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.100]   All right.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.400]   So those are my tips.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:33.300]   I guess I gave one two, three, four five ideas here for making
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.600]   those articles really look a lot better and then my or just
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.500]   to reiterate my original point.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.300]   Also, you will get better with time.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.800]   So don't compare yourself to your very favorite writers and
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.900]   say why am I not there yet?
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.900]   You want to be better than you were with the last article
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.300]   you wrote and so hopefully these tips will help.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.200]   So what the example then the nut what's the nut again?
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.500]   So that's where you actually lay out like what the big idea
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.600]   is going to be in the article.
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.300]   Okay, right.
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:01.300]   So like imagine something I was right.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.800]   Let me let me draw a quick example from writing.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.800]   I've been doing this week.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.600]   So, you know, I opened a section of a chapter.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.400]   I'm talking about Georgia O'Keeffe and I was talking about
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.800]   how busy her early career is.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.500]   I think I talked about this on the show last week.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.500]   This is the example though.
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.200]   So I'm telling the story about Georgia O'Keeffe and how
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.400]   how many different jobs she had all over the country and
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.600]   she and in the summer she would come back East and go West
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.300]   and it's just as really busy life and she really was trying
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.900]   to study painting and but would have to take these long
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:34.200]   breaks and she needed to really uncover potential is going
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.100]   to need something more that that more came when she started
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.200]   getting involved with Alfre Stieglitz and their family on
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.700]   this land by Lake George and and she started going up there
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.800]   with him and became unlocked the most prolific period of
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:47.200]   her career.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.200]   So kind of hearing the story like this is interesting.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:56.000]   The nut there is then pointing out.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.500]   So this particular section seasonality.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.600]   This is what Georgia O'Keeffe was demonstrating seasonality
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.600]   different times of the year.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   You're working on different things with different intensities
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:11.100]   is something that we we've sort of lost track of but it's
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.500]   actually really key to the human experience and something
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.600]   that we should try to get back.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:15.500]   There we go.
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:16.900]   So you have this opening story like what's this?
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:17.700]   Why this is interesting.
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.500]   What's it all about that nut graph explains it but you still
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.000]   have narrative tension because you want to say well, why
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:23.600]   is that true?
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.800]   You know, why is seasonality important?
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   Can we really get it back?
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:27.500]   What happened to it?
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.300]   Now you want to have that be resolved.
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.900]   That's the rest of that chapter then resolves those questions.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.000]   So that's an example there.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:34.700]   Got it.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.300]   The alternative would be you could just come right in and
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.900]   say seasonality is very important.
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.500]   Here's the definition of seasonality.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:47.000]   I will now give five reasons why and that's fine, but it
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.100]   this is the difference between having narrative tension and
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:49.900]   not. Yeah.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.600]   Yeah, it's textbook versus like, okay, I want to see what
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.300]   happens next.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.600]   All right, what do we got speaking of next?
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.700]   What do we have as our next question?
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.600]   My next question is from Joe.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.300]   He's a software engineer from Minneapolis.
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:06.100]   Do you use anything like a someday maybe list?
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.700]   And if so, how do you manage it?
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.300]   All right.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.800]   So someday maybe for those who don't know that's a getting
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.700]   things done a GTD reference.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:18.100]   So in his book getting things done David Allen recommends
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.600]   keeping a someday maybe list.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.400]   So it's projects that you're not actually actively working
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:27.700]   on now, but you might one day the point is in Allen's book.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.200]   It's you don't want this rattling around in your head.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.200]   You don't want this idea you have for something you might
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:35.300]   want to do one day having to be maintained just in your
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.000]   brain because anything you have to maintain just in your
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.900]   brain can become a source of stress.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.800]   You can become a source of anxiety.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:46.000]   You want it in a written down somewhere where you trust it
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   won't be forgotten.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.500]   And so he says just have this one list.
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:49.400]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.200]   It's something like that is a good idea.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.600]   You need a place or places where potential ideas are
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:00.800]   captured that you trust they will not be forgotten.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.500]   Now, I actually think this is a piece of my system my personal
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.100]   system that I need to improve.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:11.300]   My someday maybe storage right now is distributed among
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:16.800]   multiple different role specific systems, which is probably
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.000]   not optimal.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.600]   So for example, I have role specific Trello boards where
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.200]   I keep track of tasks and related obligations.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.900]   We've talked about this a lot of other episodes.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:31.700]   Each of those boards has a column labeled back burner.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.600]   That's one place that certain things go but these tend to
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:40.000]   be the things I put on a back burner list don't tend to be
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   grandiose ideas.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.600]   It's more, you know, we need to someday probably update our
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.100]   such-and-such software.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.700]   I don't want to do this now.
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.200]   What's something we should probably do we should think
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.900]   about, you know, improving our setup for having calls on
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.700]   the podcast like something just I talked about that's like
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.000]   on a back burner list where I'm not working on it now, maybe
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.500]   but it's on a back burner list.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:06.100]   So those are there then in my online note taking and right
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.300]   now use obsidian which we have a question about coming up.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.200]   There's places in there.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.600]   So I have a document in there for my academic research and
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.200]   in particular my academic research on impact of technology
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.900]   on society and digital ethics something.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.700]   I'm just starting to do some more work on there's a page
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:29.300]   in my online note taking for that for the podcast and media
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:30.000]   company.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.300]   There's another place where I keep track of visions for
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:32.800]   the future.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.900]   That's too many places.
[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.800]   So core idea one is yes, Alan is right.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.300]   You need place or places you trust to keep ideas to the
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:45.100]   not going around your head to I have a system right now
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.800]   that is too distributed.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.900]   So I want to fix it.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.500]   What am I probably thinking about doing?
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.400]   I'm thinking about having some sort of rooted someday maybe
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.200]   set up where there's a core route to where all these ideas
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.000]   are stored like that's all I have to remember is the root
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.400]   that this is my someday maybe document in my online note
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:08.100]   taking software or my someday maybe directory in my Google
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:12.300]   Drive and then from there I can link out or spread out to
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.100]   here's stuff for this part of my life.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:15.200]   Here's ideas for this part of my life.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.800]   So I'm going to do something like that and I'm going to
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.000]   root my system, but it's a good question because I think
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.200]   it's a it's an important piece of organizing and intellectual
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.200]   life that we haven't talked much about you're going to put
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:27.900]   that on your someday.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:28.600]   Maybe list.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:33.100]   It's a circular irony improve your someday.
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.500]   Maybe list you put that on your I need to start a someday
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.300]   maybe list and I need to put that on my someday.
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:39.700]   Maybe list.
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.200]   I think this is the productivity nerd version of if a tree
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.300]   falls in the forest and no one's there to hear it.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.700]   Well enough of that nonsense.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:47.400]   All right, what do we got?
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.500]   Let's keep rolling.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.700]   See I'm getting quicker now, Jesse.
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.500]   Okay picking up the pace.
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.900]   So next question is from Sam.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:59.300]   He's a 28 year old PhD student and he says I found the 500
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.700]   words a day formula for slow productivity be to be a useful
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:03.300]   frame.
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.400]   However, as a PhD student in computer science a lot of my
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.000]   work doesn't involve much writing.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.300]   How would I adapt the 500 words a day target for my research?
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:18.200]   So the context of the 500 words a day reference there from
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.000]   Sam is at some point.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.100]   I don't know maybe a few months ago.
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.800]   We on the podcast.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:28.500]   I talked about John McPhee and I think I was probably talking
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.100]   about an essay.
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.300]   I wrote for my newsletter, whatever.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:36.300]   The point is I was emphasizing that John McPhee is seen in
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:39.800]   the context of his entire career as being very productive.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.000]   He's written all these books.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:41.900]   He has the Pulitzer's.
[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:47.200]   He has the National Book Award and a huge bibliography, but
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:52.100]   he doesn't actually work that much on any given day.
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:54.700]   In fact, his target is he admits just to write 500 words a
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:58.100]   day. So this was a classic example of slow productivity.
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:01.600]   This working at this natural sustainable pace over time can
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.200]   produce great stuff.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.600]   So if we expand the timeline at which we are evaluating
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:10.800]   productivity to be a career or the last 10 years as opposed
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:14.600]   to having a narrow timeline of today or the last week you get
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.800]   this much more sustainable rhythm of work.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.100]   You don't have to be busy or killing yourself every day with
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:20.900]   work to produce stuff that you're proud of.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:21.300]   Okay.
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:25.700]   So Sam is saying what is the equivalent of 500 words a day
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:26.600]   if you're not a writer?
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.300]   And I think that's a that's a good good question.
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.600]   So we could we could address this first of all just specifically
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:37.000]   in terms of Sam's particular context, which is a PhD student
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.600]   and you look I see that I feel your pain there Sam.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:45.000]   I used to do a lot of appearances at boot camps graduate
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.600]   student dissertation boot camps that you see this at Georgetown.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.000]   I would also do it at nearby Catholic University when I knew
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   some professors over there.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.800]   It's very common that you would do these once a year gatherings
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.000]   are called dissertation boot camps where grad students get
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.800]   together to hear talks and motivate each other to work on
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   their dissertations and I was a broken record at these boot
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:11.000]   camps because all of the advice was always centered on right
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.900]   every day get your writing done.
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.700]   Don't forget to write because in a lot of disciplines writing
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:21.100]   is the actual primary activity that pushes a thesis forward
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:25.200]   not the case of mathematics not the case in computer science.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.000]   You write papers eventually but research is not writing.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.800]   It's solving math equations trying to figure out theorems
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.600]   running experiments.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.200]   And so I used to come to these boot camps and I was a broken
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:36.700]   record.
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:39.800]   I would say stop saying writing is your generic verb for
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.000]   working for a lot of people.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.600]   The core of their work has nothing to do with actually
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.000]   writing.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.600]   So I feel your pain Sam writing is should not be seen as a
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:52.100]   universal verb for doing deep work in graduate school.
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.800]   But what I want to do here is generalize out and answer this
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.200]   for people in general.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.800]   I don't want to get too academia specific.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.200]   So let's just be in general.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:05.300]   How do we translate this general philosophy of 500 words a
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.100]   day to other types of work?
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:15.800]   What I think is key here is this notion of slow and steady
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.200]   and timeline expansion.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.400]   If you expand your timeline on which you are evaluating your
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:26.700]   productivity to something at the scale of years, then often
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:30.500]   a varied slow and steady approach is going to work quite
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:31.000]   well.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.800]   And when you're evaluating your production on what you really
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.900]   care about at that type of expanded timeline, you begin to
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:45.100]   see the futility or the performative on necessity of really
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:45.900]   hard days.
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.600]   You know, I'm just burning the midnight oil.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.500]   I've been writing all day.
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.100]   I'm going to write till midnight tonight and wake up really
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:55.800]   early to write you could do that and maybe in the moment,
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:56.300]   you'll be like man.
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.200]   I know I'm being productive because look how hard I'm working.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.900]   But when you're talking about what do I produce over the
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:00.800]   next five years?
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.200]   That's not sustainable.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:07.800]   It also doesn't really matter working quality work again
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:11.300]   and again in the right setting giving the work to respect
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:12.900]   and the support it needs to be good.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.200]   Going up and down and intensely, you know what I'm taking
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:16.800]   a week off.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.600]   I didn't get there tomorrow.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.100]   I was sick today.
[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:19.000]   I didn't write who cares.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.600]   We're talking about the end of this year.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.300]   Did you produce something that you're proud of and that is
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.800]   going to be best served by slow steady quality.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:29.600]   So I think that's how we generalize John McPhee is 500 words
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:35.300]   a day is you don't have to be exhausted or frantic.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:41.300]   Today to having ended up produce something great next year.
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:47.100]   You need to slowly accrete good quality work at a reasonable
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.800]   rate and that also happens to be a much more sustainable
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.000]   way to live and work.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.500]   So, you know, that's what I would say slow steady.
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:59.400]   Don't not work but don't be so proud of yourself for you
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.000]   know, staying up real late.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.300]   That just means you forgot a deadline and you will guaranteed
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.800]   win a Pulitzer Prize like John McPhee.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.300]   All right, Jesse.
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:09.800]   What we got?
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.300]   All right.
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.200]   Next question is from Will.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.300]   He's an economist from Tacoma Park.
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:17.600]   We won't be able to meet him at Republic.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:21.900]   Did you say and he has to say did you say you are using Obsidian
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:22.300]   now?
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.800]   Why the switch from Rome?
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.700]   That's what yeah.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.200]   Well, first of all, maybe it's what we should do with the
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.300]   Republic space is because I learned from Obsidian from another
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:32.600]   friend of mine in Tacoma Park.
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:33.900]   He's a big booster.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.900]   So shout out to Scott.
[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:40.400]   So me and Scott and will we could just create Republic into
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.300]   a space where people gather to geek out in incredible detail
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:50.400]   about various Zettelkasten inspired electronic note-taking
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:50.900]   systems.
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:52.200]   All right.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:56.800]   Well, I did I am using Obsidian now for nerdish reasons.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:02.900]   And just to give the the really high-level explanation Rome
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:07.100]   well, I like Rome to actually Rome has Rome has its uses.
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:13.100]   Well Rome is a nice interface Obsidian is based off of text
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:13.500]   files.
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.400]   So when you're taking notes in Obsidian, yeah, you have this
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.300]   interface or taking notes.
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:20.300]   You can link the notes together.
[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.900]   But what you're doing is actually writing in what's known as
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:23.600]   markup.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:28.500]   So just a generic markup language in text files and what the
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.600]   Obsidian interface is doing is just reading these text files
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.800]   that sit in a directory on your computer where you pointed it
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.900]   and it's just reading those text files and it's you can go in
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:38.300]   there and read them.
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:41.600]   It's just plain text with markup markup symbols around it to
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:42.600]   indicate this is bold.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.200]   This is a list.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.400]   This is a link and let's say if this links to something else
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:50.100]   and you know, it just the other document is just there in the
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:50.700]   markup.
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:53.300]   And so when you go through your notes and Obsidian, it's a
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:53.900]   nice interface.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:56.000]   You can click around and format and do these type of things,
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.600]   but nothing lives in the cloud.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:02.400]   There's not some proprietary format that's on a AWS instance
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:02.800]   somewhere.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.800]   It's text files in your computer that you can go and read you
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.100]   can open it up in text edit.
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:08.000]   You can change it.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.600]   And when you look at it with Obsidian, it will be you will
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.300]   see those changes.
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:14.900]   So Obsidian is just an interface that allows you to edit text
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:18.100]   files in your computer and displays those text files in a
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:18.700]   nice way.
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.100]   So I like that.
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:20.900]   It's full control.
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.000]   So Obsidian could go away.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   I have all my notes.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.400]   I could read them just directly with a text editor or get any
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.000]   other type of markup reader that exists and still read those
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:29.400]   notes.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.600]   I mean, I only need to use Obsidian because I might like
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:33.400]   its interface.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.400]   Now I use Dropbox with synced backup.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.500]   So like my Obsidian setup is in a directory that's auto synced
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.100]   to Dropbox.
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.400]   So all of these notes are automatically also updated and
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.600]   copied to Dropbox.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:47.700]   So everything's backed up.
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:51.200]   And so if I get a new computer, I just re-sync to my Dropbox
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:53.000]   directory structure and I have those notes there.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.300]   So the notes live in multiple places.
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.100]   I'm not going to lose them.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.000]   Anyways, that's why I like it.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.700]   It feels like a sophisticated version of my dependence on
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:04.300]   plain text files that I already use in other parts of my
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:05.000]   productivity.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.500]   So that's a nerd reason.
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:09.100]   I think for a lot of people that doesn't really matter.
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:14.300]   So I would not use this reason as a general recommendation
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:16.400]   that everyone definitely needs to be on Obsidian.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:21.700]   But if you're a CS nerd like me or presumably like Will, it
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.400]   is kind of cool.
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:28.100]   All right, so I want to try something somewhat new here.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:30.500]   We're trying to do more case studies on this show.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:33.900]   This is the feedback we got that people would like to hear
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:37.400]   more details about real people's experiences putting these
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:38.500]   ideas into practice.
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:43.800]   As I've mentioned, the medium term goal is a call.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.200]   We want to have people call in live and actually interact
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:46.600]   with me.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.600]   That's all complicated.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.600]   Sound is complicated.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:51.500]   Don't even get me started on that, but we're working on it.
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:55.200]   In the meantime, I'm also soliciting you can send in
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:58.100]   text case studies in the same question survey that you can
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:59.300]   use to submit your questions.
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.200]   That link is in the show notes, but I wanted to read one
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.600]   today from Josh.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:07.400]   He was a network engineer who's in his 20s.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.800]   All right.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:12.100]   So here's what Josh had to say and I'll just read this a world
[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:15.600]   without email got my team and me through a crisis.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:20.800]   I got a copy of it on pre-order and it just after it arrived
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.800]   my wife and I went on vacation to Puerto Rico.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.400]   It was really lovely being able to just read about a better
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:29.300]   way to work while sitting on the beach and returning home
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:29.900]   from vacation.
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:36.700]   My IT team suffered an unexpected crisis and I was thrown
[00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:38.900]   into a demanding management role.
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:42.300]   I'm the kind of person who likes to feel in control and
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:45.200]   the one mission I could give myself to preserve some sibilance
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.800]   of that feeling was to make sure that we didn't drop a single
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.300]   ball in response to this crisis.
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:53.400]   As a team, we had minimal shared documentation and we had
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.800]   no central work repository.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.500]   So I didn't even know what engineering work was happening.
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:00.400]   My first thought was to collect all work items into a task
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.500]   board just like a world without email lays out, but I didn't
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:06.500]   have the time to wait for corporate procurement to approve
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:09.800]   an enterprise Trello subscription and we didn't have a way
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.300]   to get the team onto any sort of task board.
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:15.600]   So I ended up creating a minimum viable product out of folders
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.600]   on a shared drive.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.900]   We had a folder called active work inside of that folder.
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.200]   We had a new folder for each work item.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:28.500]   The folder name was a short description of the task itself
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:32.800]   inside that folder was a notes dot txt file that detailed
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:36.600]   the task any emails pertaining to the task were copied and
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:40.100]   pasted into an emails dot txt file.
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:44.100]   Any working documents were also saved in that folder.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:49.800]   So for example, we might have a folder named design data
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:54.400]   center core that would contain a notes dot txt file detailing
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:58.400]   all the design considerations and a working diagram and
[00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.900]   a spreadsheet also in that folder.
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:03.200]   If I were to take ownership of a task, I would modify the
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.400]   folder name to indicate that.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:10.800]   So now it might say Josh colon design data center core that
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.900]   way an alphabetical sort of the active work folder would isolate
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.300]   all of my work as I finished a task.
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.600]   I would update the notes dot txt file with closeout notes
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:24.400]   and change the folder name to completed colon Josh colon
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.600]   design data center core.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.000]   We could focus exclusively on a task by opening that folder.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.700]   We could share notes and feedback between team members by
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.400]   dropping a txt file in that folder.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.800]   We could see work in progress at a glance.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.000]   We had a way to gather detailed information about a task
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.400]   without actually having to own the task and start working
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:41.800]   on it.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.400]   We only use that system for a couple of months, but it
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.800]   accomplished its goal.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.600]   We didn't drop or forget even a single task.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.700]   There were no external teams at my company that felt like
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.900]   they needed to escalate issues to my manager.
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:57.500]   We were able to share the increased workload to the team,
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.000]   even though I was primarily the one collecting information
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:00.800]   about work items.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.400]   From there, we were able to move to a real task board and
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.400]   18 months later, our little team is now seen as an agile
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:10.900]   transformation leader within our broader organization.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.400]   All right, it's a cool case study because two reasons.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:21.100]   One, it highlights something I say often on this show, which
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:24.400]   is when it comes to organizing work, especially in teams,
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.100]   start with the process first.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.300]   What makes the most sense for us to organize our work and
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:35.300]   then to figure out what tools you need to implement that.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:38.800]   And that is exactly what Josh did in that story because
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.500]   they couldn't procure the right tools fast enough.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.600]   They said, we can just use text files and folder names and
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.400]   it worked great.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.500]   What mattered was the process.
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.400]   And then once they got approval to switch to a task board,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.600]   oh, they switched to a task board, but it was that process
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.300]   that they switched to a task board and it didn't really
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.300]   matter if they were implementing it by changing the name
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.300]   of folders or if they're on a Trello board, it was the
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.100]   same process.
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:03.100]   And so I think that's really cool to see.
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.700]   And then two, I just like that specific setup.
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:07.700]   That's a cool system.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:08.700]   Right?
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:11.300]   Folders for each thing that we're actively working on,
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:14.600]   all of the information relevant to that thing, go into
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.200]   that folder, including relevant emails, have a key read
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.500]   me file in each folder that gives you the overview of
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:23.200]   exactly where everything lands, put your name into the
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.600]   directory title.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.100]   So we know who's working on what.
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.100]   That's a great system.
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:29.000]   And see what Josh said there.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.100]   Josh said all of the incoming was directed at him.
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:37.300]   So it's this was a, in his elaboration, he said,
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.100]   "IT team within a big organization."
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:44.000]   So IT teams get hammered with, "Build us this, fix this,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   add this new feature, implement this system."
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.600]   It's all day long.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.400]   It all came to Josh.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.000]   And yet he said he felt like all this work was very
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.600]   intelligently distributed to the whole team.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.800]   Everyone was working on different things, beautiful
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.600]   collaboration.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.700]   And because they built a process here that made sense.
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:09.600]   So anyways, great example, Josh, I appreciate that
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.900]   those specifics and I appreciate that opportunity to
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.500]   talk about when you get specific about workflows, as
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.100]   opposed to just saying, "Look, we're all on Slack.
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:17.900]   Let's rock and roll."
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.000]   Things can get a lot better.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.900]   I like how he says when he does the alphabetical search,
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.700]   it can just show all his work right there.
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:28.100]   There's definitely an IT labor to that system.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:28.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:30.700]   Well, if you put your name in the folder and you can
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:34.500]   alphabetize folders, but it's not a big deal.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.900]   You can alphabetize folders.
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:36.700]   But it is true.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.900]   Like existing technology is great.
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.200]   Yeah, that's not the problem.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.100]   The problem is not that someone hasn't built a fancy
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.100]   web interface for what you're trying to do.
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.700]   The problem is you don't have a system.
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.700]   That you're just on email like, "Did you get my last
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:51.700]   message? Why didn't you respond?"
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:54.900]   Good for you, Josh.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.000]   All right.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   Let me talk about a sponsor real quick before we move
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.400]   on to our second block of questions.
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:06.100]   Blinkist Standing Sponsors, one of my favorite idea
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:09.200]   related companies, and that is Blinkist.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:14.500]   As I often say, ideas are power in our current world
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:18.700]   and the best source of ideas is almost always books.
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:21.900]   The issue is figuring out which books you should read
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.200]   and which books you don't need to.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.200]   That's where Blinkist enters the picture.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.600]   They offer 15-minute text and audio explainers called
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:33.200]   Blinks of over 5,000 nonfiction books spread over
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.600]   27 categories.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.000]   They're also now doing shortcast, which gives you
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.600]   summaries of long-form podcast.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.800]   So here is how you use Blinkist.
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   You're interested in a topic, right?
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.800]   So you're interested in crypto and blockchains.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.700]   You go find two or three books, Blockchain Revolution,
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:51.700]   Blockchain, etc.
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:56.000]   Listen to the blinks while you're on a walk or on
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.100]   your commute or read them while you're waiting in
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:59.200]   line somewhere, whatever.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.300]   Get the main ideas from those books.
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.100]   Now, you know the lay of the land of that idea.
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.000]   You're already way better off than you were before
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.800]   and you've only spent 30-45 minutes.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:10.100]   You also can figure out if you need to read something,
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.000]   which of those books is going to be best because
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.900]   you've seen their summary and what they focus on.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:18.800]   So I think of Blinkist as a sidekick that any serious
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.200]   idea reader needs.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.000]   Okay, it's something that you should have if you're
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.400]   serious about the world of ideas.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.100]   I read a Blink today, actually.
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:27.900]   Which book?
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:31.500]   It was a physics book.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.000]   It was like pretty cool.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.800]   And the thing I like about it is because you listen
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.000]   to a lot of podcasts, you read a lot of articles
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   and stuff, you get all these lists of books and
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.500]   then you're never going to be able to read everything.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:49.100]   So it's a good little way to maybe cross off some
[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:51.100]   of those books on that list that you want to get
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:51.900]   an idea of.
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.100]   That's a smart idea.
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.000]   Yeah, so you listen to a podcast, you hear seven
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:55.900]   book recommendations.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:58.400]   Do the blinks for all seven books.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.600]   You'll have the main ideas of those seven books
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.600]   and maybe one of them you'll read.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.100]   I mean, I don't know if you have this experience,
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.900]   Jesse, but for me, it's like really obvious.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.300]   It's very bimodal when I'm reading a blink of a book.
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.500]   Whether I'm like, yeah, I got what I need and whether
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.400]   I'm thinking I got to read this book.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.600]   There's a cool feature on the app too, where when
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.100]   you're going through the blink, it's got like the
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.800]   little timeline down below.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.700]   So, you know how much more you have as you're
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:23.100]   reading it.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.100]   So just bang it up.
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.700]   That's how I should evaluate my own books.
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.300]   I should go back and read the blinks and be like
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.000]   if this doesn't make me want to buy the book, I
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.300]   need to go back and make a better book.
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:35.600]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer just
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.800]   for our audience.

[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.300]   free trial.
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.800]   Blinkist.com/deep.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.700]   I was laughing when I was thinking about you
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:06:59.500]   said physics.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.300]   I was imagining reading a blink on Albert Einstein's
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:06.400]   1905 paper on special relativity and you just
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.400]   open up the blink and it says E equals MC squared.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.500]   It was talking about that actually.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.000]   That's great.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.100]   All right, one of the sponsor want to mention
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:21.900]   another longtime friend of the show that is Express
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.700]   VPN.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:27.800]   If you access the internet places outside of your
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.500]   home or your work, you need to use a VPN and we've
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.800]   explained this before on the show.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:36.100]   This is CS security 101 with a VPN.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:39.500]   You do not directly connect to a website or service
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:43.900]   you instead connect to a VPN server with a secure
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:44.800]   encrypted connection.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.200]   You tell that server.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.400]   This is the website or service.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.700]   I want to talk to that server does it on your
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.500]   behalf and then sends the information back to
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.600]   you over the encrypted connection.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.500]   Why is that important?
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.700]   It means that people who are watching who you're
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:58.400]   talking to.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.500]   So the people who are sniffing the packets you're
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.000]   sending to the access point at Starbucks.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.500]   All they know is that you're talking to a VPN
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:05.900]   server.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:09.400]   They have no idea what site or service that server
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.200]   is going to talk to on your behalf or what you're
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.600]   asking for because that's encrypted.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.500]   All right, so you need to use a VPN.
[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:19.100]   If you're going to use a VPN, I recommend Express
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:23.100]   VPN and it's because two things they have a lot
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:23.700]   of servers.
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.600]   So for a VPN to work, well, you want there to be
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.900]   a server to connect to that's not that far away.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:31.400]   If you are in Washington DC, you don't necessarily
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.900]   want to go through a server in Australia that
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.000]   would add extra lag.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.500]   So the more servers the better Express VPN has a
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.900]   ton to they have a lot of bandwidth fast
[01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.300]   connections and I'm going to add three.
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.700]   Why not third the software is easy runs in the
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:44.300]   background.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.500]   You turn it on with a click and you're just using
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:49.100]   using the VPN without even thinking about it.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.100]   Of course, there's other advantages to VPNs
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.000]   locality stuff.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.400]   Oh, I can't access UK content on Netflix.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.200]   They live in the US.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.000]   Hey connect to a VPN server in the UK Netflix
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:02.800]   thinks you're in the UK.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.600]   So it's kind of cool stuff you can do but this
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.500]   is just basic CS.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.200]   You need a VPN Express VPN is the one I recommend.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.200]   So get your money's worth from your internet and
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:17.200]   get security and privacy at Express VPN.com/deep.
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:22.400]   Don't forget to use this link Express VPN.com/deep.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.500]   Don't forget the /deep.
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.000]   That's how they know you came from me.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.400]   If you use that /deep you will also get three
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:30.800]   extra months of Express VPN for free.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.700]   Check on my time here.
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:34.300]   Oh, we're doing well.
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:34.700]   All right.
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.500]   So let's move on to our second block of questions.
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:40.700]   What we tried to do here is as we often do try
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.600]   to do is make the second block a little bit more
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.800]   deep life philosophical first block.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.900]   We got into the weeds on some things second
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:51.200]   block will get a little more philosophical here.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.500]   So what do we got Jesse?
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.300]   All right, first question here.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:59.300]   It's an anonymous question and it states, how do
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:01.500]   you think about long-term career or work issues
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:04.500]   in the face of seemingly growing accidental threats
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.100]   such as climate change economic disparity in the
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:09.900]   world and new technologies such as AI?
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:15.100]   I mean, I think the key there is stop using so
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.300]   much social media stop reading so much online
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:22.300]   news and let me let me explain where I'm coming
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.100]   from with that answer.
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.100]   First.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:27.300]   Let's begin with the premise that there always
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.100]   has been and there will always be to varying
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.500]   degrees up and down a lot of distressing stuff
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:35.300]   happening in the world.
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:38.700]   There is nothing exceptional about our current
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:39.300]   moment.
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:42.600]   I think back in a certain circumstance like this
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.400]   thing about a question like this.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.400]   I think back to the Irish Christian monastics.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.500]   Of the early medieval period the late dark ages.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:54.100]   This was a very rough time.
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:56.400]   There was a lot of bad things happening.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:00.800]   There were diseases that could kill 30 40 percent
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.100]   of a population of a continent in just a couple
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:03.800]   of years.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:07.200]   There was no political stability.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:11.800]   These monasteries were often raided by for example,
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.800]   Vikings where everyone would just be murdered.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.500]   This was not a time where you're like, yeah.
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.900]   Pretty peaceful.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.000]   I'm pretty happy about things.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.200]   But what were those Irish monastics doing?
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.700]   They were very carefully preserving and copying
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:28.000]   over a lot of the intellectual fruits of the
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.200]   ancient period and you know what we're glad they
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.200]   were we're glad they worked in this terrible time
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.600]   because it was actually in a lot of these
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.800]   monasteries that we maintain our only copies of
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.000]   some of the key ancient philosophical and
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.700]   mathematical text that then helped spur the
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:43.300]   Renaissance a couple hundred years later.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.900]   There's actually a book about that.
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:48.200]   I read called how the Irish saved the world and
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.900]   it goes what's called but I use that example
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:53.900]   to say in much worse circumstances of our today
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.000]   people working on things that are important
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.800]   ended up being really important for humanity.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:04.000]   We are glad that our forebearers in much worse
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.700]   situations than today that had to deal with
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.500]   the entire continent is half dead and will
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.900]   probably be murdered within a week.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.700]   That is worse.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:14.200]   That is a worse situation than we are unsure
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.100]   about what the average temperature increase is
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:17.500]   going to be over the next 100 years.
[01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.300]   They still worked on what they thought was
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:19.900]   important.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.000]   They still pursued a deep life and we are all
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:23.700]   the better for it.
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.600]   So that's the example I wanted to give there.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.700]   You know Ezra Klein had he wrote an article
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:31.500]   New York Times op-ed about this a couple months
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:36.200]   ago where he was hearing this about climate
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.300]   change in particular.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:40.800]   He was hearing more and more people from his
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.200]   circle who are saying well, why why would we
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:45.600]   even bother having kids?
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.600]   How would we why would we even bother trying
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.200]   to perpetuate humanity because of how bad
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.400]   climate change is going to be and Ezra was
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.200]   like look, I'm very concerned about this topic.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.400]   Obviously, I'm very much, you know, progressive
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.500]   on this topic, but my god, we had kids as a
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:04.600]   species in much worse times with much worse
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.600]   things happening on the horizon and much worse
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.000]   things happening at the moment.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.500]   We still continue to perpetuate the species
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.000]   and we're glad we are because we want to be
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.700]   here and all the all of the good and the art
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.200]   and the beauty and the love that has been
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.100]   formed that all those centuries past all these
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.000]   other past hard times.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.400]   We're glad that all existed and we're better
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:20.800]   for it.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.900]   So so even as our client had to write something
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:27.500]   that says guys ease up a little bit right like
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.200]   we Humanity faces tough stuff.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.300]   All right.
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.400]   So that's my generic answer to that question.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.700]   The reason why I cited social media and online
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:36.700]   news was just to emphasize that both of those
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:40.400]   things can make this reaction worse.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.800]   I think we're getting this question in part
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.200]   because there's the online culture for various
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.100]   reasons some intentional some unintentional
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:51.000]   can give you this sense of immediate existential
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.500]   threat that is paralyzing in a way that let's
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:58.900]   say in a pre-internet age wouldn't have and so
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.900]   I was being somewhat facetious when I said my
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.300]   answer to your question is how do I do this?
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.300]   I don't use social media.
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:05.200]   I was being sort of facetious, but I'm also
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.600]   being somewhat serious.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.000]   There's a couple different effects going on
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:09.300]   here.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.300]   Certainly there's the police blotter effect.
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:15.200]   Start reading the police bought water for your
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.500]   town and suddenly it will seem a lot more violent
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.800]   and crime-ridden than you thought about it
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.700]   before it's because you are seeing consolidated
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.600]   all the bad things that have happened over time
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.300]   in a relatively large area concentrated in our
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.600]   mind is not used to that.
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:31.800]   It's used to gathering aggregating observations
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.100]   from our actual immediate vicinity.
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:38.900]   I saw a crime happen the last three days in a
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:39.400]   row.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.000]   This is dangerous, right?
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.700]   Like that's the way we're supposed to see things.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.800]   It doesn't this warning system is not good at
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.300]   here's a list of all crimes from this million
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:50.100]   person City over the last six months.
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.700]   It can't put that in the statistical scale the
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.400]   internet makes that even worse.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:59.300]   So now you have Twitter cybernetic curation
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.600]   distributed curation algorithm.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.500]   So the effect of all these individuals making
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.500]   retweet non retweet decisions all pushing
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.400]   and pulsing through a power law graph topology
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.700]   graph does a really good job of centering
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:11.800]   surfacing things that are interesting or engaging
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.700]   or will catch our attention and all these bad
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:14.300]   things are happening.
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.300]   The world course to this network and all get
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:17.100]   brought to your attention.
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.700]   It's like the police blotter effect magnified
[01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:21.200]   like man, it's just crime everywhere.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.800]   Everything's falling apart or if it's political
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.700]   news democracy is days away days away from
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:28.500]   from failing or first climate change news.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.500]   It's like I'm surprised I even am alive today.
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:34.200]   Like how is anyone alive because it is essentially
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:39.500]   the day after tomorrow style vortexes of Arctic
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.700]   tornadoes destroying cities as far as I can tell
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:43.100]   because there's all these things I'm seeing
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:46.400]   because the volume I see so many things in such
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.600]   a large volume of these things.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.800]   This must be a real problem.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.500]   Our mind cannot do statistical modeling of like
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:55.500]   yeah, but this is over 350 million people in
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:56.000]   the country.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:56.300]   I don't know.
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   That's probably not that many.
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:00.200]   So social media can do that.
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.900]   You also have to be worried about sensationalism.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:06.400]   There's this idea of like it if it bleeds it
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.400]   leads news sources are trying to get clicks.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.600]   I think that's partially true, right?
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.100]   I mean, I mean, I think that is true.
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.000]   So like being sensationalist and talking about
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   how bad things are maybe is good business.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.600]   There's also something else that's happening
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.300]   now. I mean, I read this interesting analysis
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:27.200]   from the Niemann Center about sort of recent
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.800]   developments and a lot of sort of mainstream
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.800]   media publications where there's a few different
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.900]   things going on here.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:37.100]   But like one of the things that's going on
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:40.100]   is there's definitely more specifically more
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.300]   of a sense and this kind of comes out of the
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.500]   linguistic background of criticality and critical
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:45.900]   theories, but there's definitely more the sense
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:49.600]   that the role of reporting is in part trying
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.300]   to actually shape the world.
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.100]   So part of your job as a reporter is to try
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:58.000]   to push the world towards what is just so I
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.700]   think that the dominant academic theories right
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:04.900]   now come out of French postmodernism, which
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.500]   has a real linguistic deconstructionist
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.300]   background. So it's very language focused and
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:10.000]   it's like you can't just be neutral as a writer
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:10.800]   according to these theories.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.200]   You're going to affect the world one way or
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.100]   the other. So you need to aim yourself towards
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:16.400]   what is the good and so you might see this
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.400]   and there's like obvious applications like sort
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.700]   of post Donald Trump election.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.000]   You're going to see coverage philosophy.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.300]   That's like really what we're trying to do
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:26.300]   here is this is such an existential threat is
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.800]   like our reporting needs to help.
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:30.700]   Don't report something that could be positive
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:33.800]   for example, because the bigger issue of we
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.200]   need this person in office would not be
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.100]   certified that I think some of that is bled
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.900]   over into other types of issues.
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:40.400]   I think we're seeing a little bit of that with
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.200]   climate change.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.200]   So a serious issue to be addressed, but there's
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.500]   also a sense in the reporting of trying to
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:52.800]   challenge the people who are not worried about
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.600]   it. So typically this would be on the other
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.500]   political tribe. Well, I dare you not to be
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:58.300]   worried about it now.
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.500]   Well, what if we ratchet up now?
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.300]   I dare you.
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:05.000]   Well here here you're going to be dead all your
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:05.700]   here's a headlight.
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.400]   All of your children will be dead by Sunday
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.100]   because of climate change.
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.500]   Now, I dare you to say you don't care.
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.700]   There's this sort of one up upsmanship that
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.600]   you've seen in the coverage of climate change
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:17.200]   even where the on the ground information hasn't
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:17.900]   changed much.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.600]   There's still the same concerns and whatever
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.400]   is you see this one upsmanship of well, what
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.600]   about this thread or that thread?
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.800]   We're going to put on the page more and we're
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.900]   going to try to ratchet it up.
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.600]   And again that that comes out of this new
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:32.500]   philosophy perhaps of journalism is trying to
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.500]   advance towards the just and away from the
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.300]   non-just you get more of that to there some of
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:39.300]   that early in the pandemic as well where okay,
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.200]   what's the pandemic policy that we think is
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.400]   going to be the best?
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.700]   How do we then in a reporting be careful to
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.600]   support that don't talk about this this would
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.400]   see doubt really push this.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:52.600]   Oh, look, there's a there's a some popularity
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.600]   going around this idea.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.400]   This doesn't affect young people as quickly get
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.000]   on our front page a proper pro of nothing an
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.600]   article about a third-year-old who died because
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.800]   we need to push back on that.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.200]   So once you see coverage trying to shape how
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:10.000]   people trying to shape how people understand
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.500]   things are trying to push things towards the
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.800]   just on alarming issues like climate change or
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.400]   the pandemic you're going to get also increasingly
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.400]   alarming coverage because that in theory would
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.700]   serve the purpose of getting people to care
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:24.200]   more but it has a side effect of getting people
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.600]   who say why should I even work?
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.100]   All right, that's a bunch of words, but honestly
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:34.100]   get more local serve your community serve your
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:37.200]   friends care about the people around you move
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.600]   more of your attention landscape to the to the
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.200]   locality that your brain evolved to expect which
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.800]   is these are people in my town and people my
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.900]   organizations spend more time immersed in that
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:53.000]   world. You're scaling the concerns concerns your
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.700]   brain can deal with and concerns where you can
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:56.200]   actually make a difference.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.400]   I do not subscribe to this idea that you are
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.500]   somehow not being a good global citizen. If
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:04.000]   you're not marinating yourself and story after
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.100]   story about negative things that you can't do
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.600]   anything about I guarantee you you will still
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.500]   know about climate change. Even if you're not
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:14.500]   surfing every day 10 or 15 climate change damage
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.800]   porn type articles. You'll still know about it.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.700]   But instead of surfing those 15 articles, how
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:23.100]   about we want to fix the playground that's down
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:25.100]   the road because it's a good place these kids
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:26.700]   after school. They need it. They don't have it
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:28.400]   here. How do we get that change? That's the scale
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.900]   at which our mind supposed to work. So let's
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:31.900]   spend more time more time there.
[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:37.100]   All right, what time we got here? I think we
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:40.300]   got time for one more question Jesse. Okay, so
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:43.300]   we got a question from Michael. He's a 41 41
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.800]   year old engineer from the UK. This is what he
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.300]   has to say. I have worked hard to clarify ideas
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:51.300]   outside of my work that feel important to me.
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:54.900]   However, I still struggle. For example, creating
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.800]   a garden is something I've always envisioned my
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.400]   life for a long time. But now that I'm doing it
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.400]   it feels like endless drudgery, labor and effort.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.700]   However, I've sunk so much effort and expense
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:07.300]   into getting here. I cannot just reset and walk
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:10.100]   away. Is it normal to find conflict between
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.700]   one's cultivation of a deep life on paper and
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:15.300]   how it actually happens in the real world?
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:19.100]   That's an interesting question. Let me give you
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:20.800]   a short answer and a long answer Michael. The
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.200]   short answer is stop gardening. I won't tell
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:27.100]   anyone Jesse won't tell anyone. You don't like
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:30.100]   it and I get it. Like here in DC. Here's what
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:32.900]   I've learned. It's often the season in which
[01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:34.800]   you would be maintaining a garden or a yard.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.300]   It's often terrible outside and it's not that
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:44.300]   fun because the humidity is roughly whatever
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.400]   it is. I don't know how to measure humidity.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.200]   I guess Dew point the humidity is terrible.
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:49.600]   You're in a swamp. It's hot. There's bugs and
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.500]   there's mosquitoes and you know, this is why
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:53.400]   God invented air conditioning. So I'm stop
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:57.200]   gardening. You don't like it long answer and
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.900]   we talked about this last week to be wary about
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:04.200]   a mental conception of the deep life that is
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:09.000]   too heavily focused on hobbies. That is not
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.700]   going to be a successful recipe. If all you
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:14.100]   think about is what do I do outside of work in
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:15.900]   terms of my leisure time? What's going to be
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:18.000]   like interesting and fulfilling to me. It's
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.300]   too self-focused that stuff matters, but it
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.600]   cannot be central to your conception of the
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.100]   deep life. If you go back and think about the
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:28.500]   deep life bucket. So we're talking about craft
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.600]   community Constitution contemplation and
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.600]   celebration. What you talk about as hobbies is
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:38.600]   maybe just in celebration. I mean, I don't know
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:41.400]   if you acted the Constitution maybe like there's
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:44.000]   some exercise you do that could be hobbyist
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.600]   sometimes in craft. There could be something
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.900]   like you're really into an instrument. You might
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:50.400]   put that in the craft, but most of the deep life
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:54.800]   is more about keeping your body in shape serving
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.000]   your community. Engage in your brain in the
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   world of ideas and philosophy and theology so
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.200]   that you can be a moral intellectual being so
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.800]   that you can follow Aristotle's theory that it
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.900]   is in deep thought that humans reach their
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:12.500]   deepest potential. It's craft. Okay. I'm spending
[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:15.700]   my 80,000 hours in my life in a job. Like what
[01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:18.100]   am I doing? Am I producing things of value? Am
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:21.000]   I am I a leader to other people? Am I a useful
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.500]   member of my community? A lot of that is not
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:26.700]   what's going to make me, you know, entertain me
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:29.000]   what's going to be something that's kind of fun
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.300]   to do. And so if you really go through those
[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:33.300]   buckets one by one, the reason why this works
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.500]   is that the human brain is not so happy. If all
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.100]   it thinks about is how do I make myself happy?
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.800]   You know, how do I be happy in the moment? Like
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.600]   that's important in moderation, but basically
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.900]   the history of ideas tells us that just the
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:52.200]   hedonic pursuit of what's going to be fun doesn't
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.800]   work as an organizing principle for life. So
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.700]   when celebration is just this one part, like
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:58.700]   having things you really enjoy doing, then it's
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.900]   the stakes are lower. You know, you're doing
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:04.000]   other things that sacrifice and service and
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.800]   important and you're going to be a lot more
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.700]   confident and fulfilled. And then when it comes
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:10.400]   to that, let's say celebration bucket where it's
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.000]   like appreciating the things that makes life
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.100]   cool having gratitude. Then I'm just going to
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:16.700]   suggest have a more experimental approach. Don't
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:19.700]   dive in fully into something that you hope will
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:21.400]   be something you really like because you might
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:24.600]   not. So garden, I don't know. Let me get a
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.600]   garden box and see if I like that minimal impact.
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:30.700]   If I really like it expand out with that bucket
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:33.300]   larger and larger people who have these big
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.100]   all-consuming hobbies usually work their way
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:36.700]   incrementally. You have to discover what's the
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:40.200]   right fit for you. So just don't go into it.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.700]   Don't just say like I want to be a cinephile. I
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.800]   think that'd be cool. I'm going to sign up for
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.300]   this film course and start watching all these
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.900]   movies. You might not actually like movies that
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:49.800]   much. You're right. But instead if you're like,
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:52.600]   I've always liked movies and I've started to
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.400]   study them a little more and I'm enjoying that.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.800]   So now let me ratchet up to like go watch this
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.600]   series at the local theater. Now. I'm going to
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.700]   sign up for this film class when things ratchet
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:03.100]   up in terms of self-directed autonomous
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:05.600]   non-instrumental hobbies. That's how you figure
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.500]   out what you really like. Okay, so stop gardening.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:09.600]   You don't like that experiment with other things,
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:12.200]   but remember that is just one small piece out
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.000]   of many on what goes into making a deep life
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.900]   and most of what makes a deep life deep is much
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:18.600]   less about what is going to make me happy tomorrow
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.300]   and more about what's going to make my life feel
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:22.900]   more grounded. What's going to make my life feel
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:26.000]   more centered and meaningful and important and
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.500]   that's very different than enjoying pruning your
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:35.400]   roses. Let's see here. We had a couple of the
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.100]   questions, but I think this is probably a good
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.300]   probably good place to wrap it up.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:43.900]   Sounds good. All right, everyone. Thank you for
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:46.200]   submitting your questions. If you want to submit
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.500]   your own questions, look at the link in the show
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.600]   notes and I'll show you exactly how to do that.
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:53.700]   You can watch a video of this episode and clips
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:56.900]   at youtube.com/calnewportmedia. We'll be back
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:00.000]   next week with a new episode and until then as
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.600]   always stay deep.
