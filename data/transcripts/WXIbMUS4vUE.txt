[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   A heavy question today from a listener to the podcast, Joseph from Pleasanton, California.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.120]   "Hello Pastor John, my friend has been suffering through extreme fibromyalgia for three years.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.680]   He describes the experience as the feeling of knives stabbing, fire burning, and 30 people
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.140]   pounding and beating his body daily and constantly.
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.920]   Day and night this happens unabated.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.620]   He and his family have been desperately praying for healing and seeking all avenues of treatment
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.900]   but with no results.
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.020]   Although they are a Jesus loving, Bible believing, missional family, their family is having a
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.500]   difficult time holding onto God's promises.
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.060]   Christ's own suffering ended after a few hours, but my friend has been suffering for years,
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.140]   with little hope of recovery for the rest of his life.
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.420]   I know there are many good books and videos that teach about knowing God's goodness in
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.740]   pain and suffering and hoping in the next life, but what is some practical biblical
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.700]   counsel for encouraging this family?"
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:12.100]   The first thing I would say is don't let their suffering drive you away.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.620]   It is easy to become weary sharing in someone's suffering.
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.180]   And yet Paul tells us in Galatians 6 that the law of Christ is fulfilled precisely in
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.260]   this, that we bear one another's burdens.
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:39.140]   So consider it a beautiful ministry in the name of Jesus, for the glory of Jesus, by
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:47.860]   the power of Jesus, to be steadfast in your friendship and your personal presence.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.700]   That's the first thing I would say.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.220]   The second thing I would say, and I'm sure it's almost too obvious to need saying, is
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.580]   that you don't give the impression that you have been through this yourself and can empathize.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.440]   Even if you have suffered much, all suffering is unique, absolutely unique.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.720]   There are things about it that no one else has tasted in the very same way.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.300]   Therefore the comfort we give should not include statements about our own suffering and our
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.100]   own capacity to empathize.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.320]   I know what you're going through or something like that.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.580]   We don't.
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.460]   It's almost worthless to ever say that.
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:42.740]   If you have a capacity to empathize, and it sounds like you do, it will be seen and known
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.500]   by your presence and your patience and your mercy.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:56.600]   Third, I would say don't give up on praying patiently for relief and healing.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.520]   Sometimes we just settle in with sickness and we've prayed so long that we've given
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.640]   up on hoping for healing, and unless you get a pretty clear word from the Lord about that,
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.760]   don't give up.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.880]   In order to avoid vain repetitions, which sometimes we fear, like I've prayed for this
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.160]   so often it just sounds like an empty, vain repetition in my prayer.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.720]   In order to avoid that, ask for specific kinds of relief from day to day.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.740]   Maybe there's a special sore that just won't heal, and that sore you put your hand on gently
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.640]   and you pray, "God, heal this sore."
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.740]   Or maybe they just haven't been able to sleep for three nights, and that's what you focus
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.600]   on in prayer.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.820]   Or maybe it's some relational burden, some child that's adding to the burden, or some
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.880]   dad or spouse.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.860]   But don't ever stop praying.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.340]   In the presence of those folks, to God for his merciful relief.
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.500]   There's always some measure of relief that they could use, even if the whole disease
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.540]   isn't taken away.
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.920]   Jesus said, "Do unto others as we would have them do unto us," and we all would hate to
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.700]   live in constant pain.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.020]   So how can we not ask that there be some measure of respite?
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.440]   Here's the fourth thing I would say.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.940]   This gets biblical and theological, but you discern the time when it's right for this.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.220]   Remind your friend and his family that suffering, while owing to the universal sin of mankind,
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.200]   is not always owing to a specific sinfulness in the one who suffers.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.540]   And therefore, this suffering need not be an indictment of some particular flaw in your
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.840]   friend.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.460]   To me, one of the most amazing and encouraging and important passages about suffering is
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.860]   in Hebrews 11, where the author says that great triumphs over suffering are given through
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.380]   faith and great endurance of suffering is given through faith.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.460]   Listen to this passage, and I'll point out where the transition occurs.
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.220]   It's really remarkable, because there's not even a heartbeat in between the two.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.460]   Through faith, they conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.760]   of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.900]   of weakness, became mighty in war, put armies to flight, women received their dead by resurrection.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.900]   Stop.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.900]   No comments.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.860]   Just, if you stopped right there, you'd say, "Whoa, the Christian life is triumph, triumph,
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.860]   triumph, triumph."
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.460]   And without any explanation, the next thing out of his mouth is, "Some were tortured,
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.620]   refusing to accept release so that they might have a better life.
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.860]   Others suffered mocking and flogging and even chains and imprisonment.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.900]   They were stoned.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.260]   They were sawn in two.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.220]   They were killed with the sword.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.820]   They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated."
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.480]   And all of this is said to be by faith.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.780]   By faith they did those things.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:34.260]   Those who lead their lives in utter misery were champions of faith, just as those who
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.280]   experienced miracles of deliverance were champions of faith.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:45.080]   So my point here for the encouragement of the family is that you find regular ways to
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.420]   remind them that there is a whole stream of Scripture about the suffering of the righteous,
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.340]   not just the suffering of those who need chastisement.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.840]   And that'll change the way the battle is fought.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:03.260]   Maybe the best example that everybody would think of for righteous suffering is Job, because
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.860]   Job is considered the most righteous man in the East.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.200]   That's what the Bible says he was.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.620]   And yet God permitted Satan to afflict him with horrific boils, fibromyalgia perhaps,
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.180]   without even knowing it.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:24.540]   We don't know how long these boils lasted, but Job was brought to the brink of unbelief
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.540]   by them.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:31.220]   And God showed up just in the nick of time in those latter chapters to keep Job back
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.580]   from despair.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.660]   The book of Job forces us to do two things.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.980]   It forces us to come to terms with the fact of God's absolute sovereignty over our suffering,
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.320]   even though Satan had a hand in it.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:50.540]   At the end of the book, in chapter 42, verse 11, the inspired writer says this, "Then they
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:56.000]   came to him, all his brothers and sisters, and all who had known him before, ate bread
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.640]   with him in his house.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:04.140]   They showed sympathy to him, comforted him for all the evil that the Lord had brought
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.700]   upon him."
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:11.740]   So even though Satan was the immediate cause of Job's horrible sickness, and it's right
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:19.780]   and good to resist the devil always and to pray for relief from his attacks always, nevertheless,
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:26.700]   we always submit to the fact that God is sovereign over Satan, and what God permits, he permits
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.700]   wisely and with good purposes.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:36.100]   And that's the second thing to see from Job, namely that by God's grace, we can actually
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:42.980]   come to see God's purposes as compassionate and good, because that's exactly the way James
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.500]   in chapter 5, verse 10, talks about Job.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:52.780]   He says, "As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.780]   name of the Lord.
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.240]   Behold, we consider those blessed who remain steadfast.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:05.360]   You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.220]   how the Lord is compassionate and merciful."
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.640]   And so the last thing I would say is that you be in earnest prayer for two miracles
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.280]   always, the miracle of healing and physical relief on the one hand, and the miracle of
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:26.900]   actually seeing and feeling the hand of God as compassionate and merciful.
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.020]   It's a miracle of equal standing with healing.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:37.420]   Christ suffered unspeakably so that your friend's sins might be forgiven and all his sufferings
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.640]   might be repaid with endless ages of happiness in the presence of God.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.740]   So pray that he believe that and rest in that.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.740]   Yeah.
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.940]   Thank you, Pastor John, for the answer, and thank you, Joseph, for sending in the question.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.620]   We are now going to break for the weekend, and you can, of course, subscribe to our podcast.
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.660]   You can find our audio feeds, and you can search our episode archive and reach us by
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.660]   email with a difficult question that you might be facing, like this one from Joseph.

[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:16.380]   Well we talk a lot about principles for Bible interpretation because we want you to have
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.520]   the tools that you need to make discoveries for yourself in scripture.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.660]   And on Monday, we're going to hear from a woman who wants a basic description of what
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.720]   it means to arc a Bible passage and how to do it.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.420]   This is one of the fundamental tools of Bible interpretation, and you won't want to miss
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.420]   it.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.420]   That's on Monday.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.420]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.660]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast, and have a great weekend.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.420]   We'll see you on Monday.
