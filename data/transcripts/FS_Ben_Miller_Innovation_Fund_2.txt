[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   Hello, everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.240]   And in this episode, I have a special guest with me,
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.280]   Ben Miller, the co-founder and CEO of Fundrise,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.200]   to specifically talk about his Fundrise Innovation Fund.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.760]   So welcome to the show again, Ben.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.920]   Sam, good to see you.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.520]   Yeah, good seeing you again.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.200]   So tell us, listeners, how the Fundrise Innovation Fund got
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.280]   started and why you decided to start a Fundrise Innovation
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.440]   Fund, given your focus has been on property
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.720]   for the past 11-plus years?
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.400]   Yeah, that was the most frequent question
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.000]   we got from investors.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.680]   So when we built Fundrise, we learned a lot about technology.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.920]   For the last 11-plus years, we built
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.360]   most of the major components that exist in the technology
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.860]   business.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.360]   So we have-- I mean, we sit on top of the cloud,
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.840]   so we didn't build the hardware systems ourselves.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.360]   But we-- databases, APIs, transaction engine,
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.960]   payment processing, data analytics, data engineering,
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.560]   product, product development, iOS apps, Android apps.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.680]   We have 2 million users, millions, billions of dollars.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.240]   So we know a decent amount about technology at this point.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.560]   And we also know a lot about the business lessons
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.120]   of building a company.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.280]   Our digital marketing, we spent tens of millions
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.660]   of dollars in digital marketing.
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.840]   And that's a very important part of go-to-markets.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.720]   I have 20-some years in real estate.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.420]   I know a decent amount about real estate.
[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.200]   But at some point, we started having observations
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.440]   about what was wrong with venture capital
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.680]   and why it's basically impossible to get.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.920]   You're essentially not able to invest in venture capital
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.120]   if you're a normal person.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.080]   And that's like-- our mission was
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.840]   to democratize real estate, because you
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.040]   couldn't invest in real estate when we started,
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.360]   unless you wanted to buy a house.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.400]   And so our mission was to democratize
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.720]   investing into essentially great investments
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.520]   that you couldn't normally get.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.640]   And we really have done that with real estate.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.120]   And we are a scaled business.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.600]   We have 20,000 residential units and millions
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.840]   of square feet of industrial.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.040]   And we are a big lender in the space.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.320]   And we have hundreds of thousands of investors.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.840]   And we raise a lot of money from venture funds.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.680]   And I know a decent amount about it.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.240]   And we just saw it as both a problem and an opportunity.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.920]   Why shouldn't people be able to do this?
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.960]   That doesn't seem right to me.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.460]   It seems unjust.
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.920]   And we have expertise in it.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.400]   And so it became ultimately the natural next step
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.000]   for the business.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.960]   OK.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.720]   And timing-wise, it seems pretty auspicious,
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.600]   given there was a downturn in 2022,
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.040]   tremendous valuation bubbles bursting, it seems like.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.760]   What are you seeing in terms of valuations from 2022 to now?
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.260]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.460]   I mean, obviously, being lucky is so critical
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.120]   to being successful.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.680]   And we were lucky.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.080]   And also, we went about trying to figure out
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.840]   how to do this, which is democratizing investing
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.320]   into venture capital.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.920]   And we went to the SEC.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.440]   We've worked with the SEC on many other kinds of innovations.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.940]   And we figured out a way to do that.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.400]   And that took a couple of years.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.980]   We've been really trying to figure out
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.320]   how to do this for a while.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.240]   And we actually sort of got the green light from the SEC
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.520]   in 2020, before the pandemic.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.440]   And then the pandemic hit.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.760]   And for a lot of reasons, but one of the reasons is,
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.800]   you saw the tech valuations went crazy.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.360]   And so we actually didn't launch it,
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.800]   because we thought that it was maybe not the right moment
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.240]   for us to do that.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.560]   We focused on the real estate.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.960]   We focused on execution of real estate,
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.920]   because there was a lot happening in the world.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.000]   And then we turned our attention back to venture in 2022.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.080]   And what had happened is that it turned out
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.560]   2020, 2021 was a bubble, tech bubble in particular.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.680]   And the tech valuations were anywhere from 100 to 500 times
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.640]   revenue.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.760]   And in the public markets, they got as high
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.920]   as 50 to 70 times revenue.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.280]   So everything had gotten inflated
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.440]   by the Federal Reserve's sort of stimulus and fiscal stimulus.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.320]   And so when the tech market collapsed,
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.800]   we said, this is the time to go.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   And so we launched the fund about a year ago.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.960]   We started raising capital into it.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   But then we were very slow to deploy it.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.480]   And we can talk about essentially
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.080]   how the fund works, but the one key part--
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.760]   and it's kind of a constant refrain with me--
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.320]   is we really try to have discipline.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.360]   We try.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.080]   And so we were slow to deploy, which
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.000]   is very unusual in the investment business
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.120]   to have capital and not deploy it.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.240]   And we didn't charge fees on the undeployed capital, actually,
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.760]   because it's a different challenge investing
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.960]   in the private markets than public markets.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.640]   It's not enough to have money.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.560]   If you have money, you say, oh, I want to buy Nvidia, Google.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.560]   You can do that.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.520]   But if you want to buy the best tech companies
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.320]   in the private markets, you can't.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.520]   You have to get access.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.840]   And that's what was taking so long,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.960]   was just getting access to the companies
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.040]   that we thought we wanted to own.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.760]   And that's what essentially has been the recent breakthrough.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.960]   But we can get to that later.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.560]   Got it.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.800]   So it does seem like the timing to invest
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.640]   in growth private companies is better, definitely better,
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.800]   than in 2021 and in early 2022.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.760]   So in terms of access, because I hear you,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.320]   and I think a lot of people realize that getting access,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.440]   investment access to these select private companies
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.080]   is very hard for the average person to do.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.000]   So how was Fundrise able to, for example, invest alongside tier
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.520]   one venture capital firms like Y Combinator for a company
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.840]   like Vanta, for example, where it looks like Fundrise
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.800]   Invasion Fund invested $5 million at a valuation
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.360]   at last funding of $1.65 billion?
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.640]   How do you gain access to these deals?
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.120]   Well, so it's changed over time.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.960]   And there's different market reasons.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.840]   Usually, it's a combination of your network and the market.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.720]   And the market is much more important
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.800]   than everybody says it is.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.560]   Everybody talks about adding alpha and their capabilities.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.560]   But everybody's riding the wave of the macro.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.320]   And the macro-- that's what I learned in 2008
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.560]   when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt--
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.000]   is that the macro is way, way more important
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.120]   than everybody pretends.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.520]   And it's a big part of why people are successful or not
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.760]   successful.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.920]   So when the market collapsed in tech, a lot of money
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.640]   left this industry.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.360]   I mean, the amount of venture money fell by a huge amount.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.040]   I don't know if it's 50%, 75%, 80%.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.840]   Depends on the stage of the company.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.120]   But really, the lack of capital created an opportunity
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.400]   for a new capital source to come in.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.880]   And so companies were--
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.040]   especially good executives-- were
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.440]   worried about having enough money,
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.040]   wanted to basically take more money than they would have
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.200]   maybe otherwise.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.080]   A lot of the mid- to late-stage investors
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.080]   had disappeared from the market.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.920]   And so we were lucky to be able to fill
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.840]   a vacuum that had happened as a result of the collapse
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.320]   in the market.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.240]   Interesting.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.520]   And would you say that the more you
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.800]   invest in certain companies that turn out to be successful,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.160]   have momentum, the easier it is to gain access
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.840]   to other companies because it demonstrates a track record?
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.720]   I mean, there's a few-- it's so funny.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.400]   If you study venture, if you work in venture,
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.480]   most of the storied venture funds
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.160]   that became so successful, they started
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.320]   by having one or two great investments that
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.960]   made them famous.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.360]   And how much of those investments were luck
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.040]   and how much of those investments were skill--
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.000]   definitely not all skill, definitely also luck.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.680]   And so it's like self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.120]   Once you have one good investment, oh, I invested.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.080]   I funded Google.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.640]   I funded Microsoft.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.640]   It made you basically a venture fund
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.920]   that got the next companies.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.760]   And so that's definitely how it works.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.200]   And the more we have world-class companies,
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.400]   the more world-class companies will want us or accept us.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.240]   So that's basically the broader frame.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.360]   And then the second thing happened
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.280]   that happened really recently that we
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.320]   haven't talked about yet.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.080]   So the first thing was we filled a vacuum.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.480]   We started investing.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.720]   But it looks like we're investing slowly.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.480]   But the market-- we found a new way
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.880]   to invest that really was exceptional.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.280]   And what is that new way to invest?
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:08.520]   So what happened-- let me pan out for a minute.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.080]   Companies used to go public after three or four or five
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.960]   years.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.200]   And they would go public way earlier.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.040]   And so Amazon went public after three years.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.520]   And Microsoft went public.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.360]   And so they were actually like, you come in.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.720]   You'd be a venture investor.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.280]   You'd invest in the first one or two rounds.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.480]   And they go public.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.160]   And then since 2008, companies have stayed private a lot
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.200]   longer.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.960]   And that money has been coming from private markets.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.160]   And so instead of just having a series A and a series B,
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.200]   companies will have A, B, C, D, E. I mean,
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.120]   they'll just keep-- they'll stay private for 10 years, 12 years.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.400]   And so then at a macro level, the downstream consequences
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.480]   of that are like normal investors
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.520]   didn't get to participate in Uber going from zero
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.600]   to $50 billion or Facebook going from zero to $50 billion.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.240]   A lot of that gets that capital or wealth creation
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.400]   is happening in the private markets.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.480]   And then two, obviously, there's a lot of capital
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.920]   that's needed in the private markets.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.640]   And then what happened with the market collapsing
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.200]   was a lot of that capital that they
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.560]   expected to get exits from public offerings, from IPOs,
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.200]   didn't get exits.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.840]   They got stuck in private markets.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.720]   Right.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.640]   And so then we found is that some of them became sellers.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.120]   At discounts.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.960]   Well, discount or not discount, basically,
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.320]   like there's a market price.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.280]   And the market price is mostly being
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.600]   driven by the public markets.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.000]   The multiples public markets have a huge influence
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.480]   on private markets.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.800]   And so if you are a seed investor
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.400]   and you invested at whatever in Stripe at a $10 million
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.640]   valuation and Stripe is now worth $50 billion,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.240]   you're probably a seller.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.400]   And there's just a ton of people like that,
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.920]   a ton of funds and early employees.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.840]   And so you can get into, or we have
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.920]   been able to get into, basically, I think,
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.400]   the best companies in the world at valuations
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.720]   that I think are fair, attractive, and certainly way
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.760]   lower at deep discounts to 2021.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.440]   And so you can say, OK, do I think the revenue multiple is
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.280]   good for the best company in the world?
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.320]   But we're into the best companies
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.240]   in the world, in my opinion.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.200]   And that's basically the access challenge.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   And that's been freaking incredible, incredible.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.480]   Because in a way, my job is basically
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.080]   to give investors, normal investors,
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.680]   access to the best investments they previously couldn't get.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:59.760]   And that is real estate and credit and now venture.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.840]   And so tell us about the structure of the team
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.640]   looking for these deals.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.600]   How does that work?
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.400]   Do you have a team?
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.200]   Do they email people that they know in their network?
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.920]   How does that whole process work where
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.160]   once you identify a promising investment,
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.640]   you actually are able to get on the cap table
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.080]   and make that investment?
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.160]   Yeah, I mean, let me just start with what's normal.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.040]   And then let me tell you how we kind of took
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.840]   a different approach.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:30.960]   Because the normal way is that maybe Sam and you and I
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.440]   will start a venture fund.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.960]   We'll go off and see you and me.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.960]   And maybe we have a dog.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.680]   I have a dog.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.640]   And we would go raise money from either some super high net
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.960]   worth people or some small institutions.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.320]   And our first fund might be $10, $20, $30 million.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.880]   Then, or let's say it's $200 million, whatever.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.760]   It's a larger, medium-sized fund.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.720]   Then basically we hired a guy who
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.680]   used to work at one of these larger funds who
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.120]   was freaking incredible.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:01.880]   And he showed up.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.560]   And he's like, OK, this is what we need to do.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.240]   This is what I've always done.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.480]   I start emailing executives of these companies.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.760]   And I have these cold emails go out.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.000]   And then I work my network and try to have coffee with them.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.080]   And we watched him do it.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.120]   And we did a little bit.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.080]   And we were like, well, that doesn't
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.240]   seem like a great way to do business.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.560]   And then the way venture funds normally invest
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.320]   is they invest in what they can get.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.480]   So it's somewhat like they think of it--
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.800]   this is you have a funnel.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.880]   And you try to get deal flow.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.960]   And you try to get as much deal flow as possible
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.680]   by networking and by emailing.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.440]   And then basically maybe you spend your day
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.680]   meeting with 10 companies a day or five companies a day.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.880]   And it's like a CRM process, right?
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.200]   You have leads.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.120]   And you have-- and you're basically
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.320]   trying to just get as many companies to your funnel.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.940]   And as you get down through the funnel,
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.400]   you start to filter to the best companies.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.040]   And it's a combination of what you can get into your funnel,
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.880]   what companies you like, and then what
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.320]   companies will take your money.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.720]   There can only be one lead, series A, one lead, series B.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.880]   And so unless you're the top, top, top ones, which
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.400]   basically are Sequoia, maybe Interest and Hurwitz,
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.160]   maybe there's five.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.480]   There's not that many that basically the best companies
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.400]   will choose them always.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.040]   Like you'll always choose Sequoia over a venture fund
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.560]   that is not in the top five to 10.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.560]   Because essentially, especially in the beginning,
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.800]   companies are choosing a name brand
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.200]   to try to build their own brand.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.240]   So the press will write about some Sequoia-backed company
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.720]   working on AI, some Sequoia-backed company working
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.160]   on SaaS.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.680]   And you're really getting brand affiliation.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.160]   So you take the money basically for brand affiliation.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:05.000]   And that's why in the series A, you can't win that fight.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.920]   Can't win that fight.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.120]   That is a fight that's a losing battle.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.040]   If you're in the series A space and you're not
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.720]   one of these brands, you're getting
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.360]   the second best companies.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.440]   Adverse selection.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.200]   So we said, well, we don't want to do that.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.640]   That's who wants adverse selection.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.000]   That doesn't make sense.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.560]   Plus it's really, really risky.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.280]   It's really risky.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.840]   Series A is, and before, super risky.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.960]   And so as you get later stage, it's a very different dynamic.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.840]   Because the later stage companies
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.400]   take Avanta, which is not that late a stage.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.320]   But if you take a business that has 100 employees or 200
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.640]   employees or 500 employees, and they
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:46.800]   may have $50 million in revenue or $200 million in revenue,
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.920]   the money they're raising is totally different.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.480]   They don't really need brand affiliation.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.680]   Their value add provided by a later stage investor
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.840]   is very low, very little.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.520]   Maybe some business introductions,
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.040]   maybe it's nothing.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.200]   Often it's negative because the later stage investor
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.120]   is more of a financial institution
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.960]   and less of a company builder.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.000]   And financial institutions have different incentives
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.640]   than company builders, which is why a lot of companies
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.400]   who raise a lot of money in 2021 have a lot of problems.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.360]   So we basically started out trying
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.640]   to get out there and talk to great companies.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.080]   But basically, people weren't going to take our money, mostly.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.880]   They'll take some.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.760]   So we flipped it.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.800]   So what are the best companies?
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.080]   And you can go look at Bessemer's, Cloud 100.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.680]   You can go-- you have to be a little bit knowledgeable
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.520]   to know this is a really good company.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.520]   Most people haven't heard of these companies.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.680]   But if you know what you're talking about,
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.160]   you know that-- if you asked 100 venture people, what
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.320]   are the best 20 companies, they probably more or less agree.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.560]   That's what's so interesting.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.280]   So it's actually not an identification problem.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.240]   It's actually an access problem.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.280]   And then you have this dynamic where
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.160]   there's a lot of sellers in their cap tables.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.920]   There's a lot of people who basically, like,
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.640]   I'm a seed investor.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.000]   I just made 20x.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.520]   I'm not even that price sensitive.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.240]   If I make 21x or 19x, it doesn't matter to me.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:20.920]   Not that much.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.120]   I mean, you basically-- so it's like a really interesting
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.880]   dynamic where you have a somewhat price insensitive
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.640]   seller, and you can get into investing
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.800]   in the best companies in the world that are not public.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.280]   So we found a really-- and that may be just a moment in time.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.000]   I think when the companies are going public,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.920]   and there's not a lot of money in the market today.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   So there's a moment where we're just hand over fist
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.520]   trying to get by into these best companies.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.960]   And we're doing it.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.440]   I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.760]   I hear you on being the brand name, a top five brand name
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.480]   company, leading the investment charge.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.240]   And then you see these other companies co-invest--
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.200]   or not co-invest.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:07.760]   They're like--
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.440]   They follow.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.720]   They follow, right?
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.680]   Is that so bad to be able to follow a big brand company?
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.200]   Because it all kind of depends on your size, too.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.860]   Because if you have a smaller fund, then if you follow,
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.120]   you don't have to be the lead.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.080]   Are there better terms for the lead investors
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.120]   than the follow investors?
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:25.720]   No, no.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.240]   But you can't be a follow.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.360]   The follow is also--
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.520]   Also tough.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.520]   Also tough.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.400]   And it's the lead investor does the work.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.160]   The follow investor just tags along.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.920]   They get the same terms.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.800]   The only main difference is the lead investor usually
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.640]   gets a board seat.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.240]   Otherwise, economically, it's the same terms.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.360]   OK.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.320]   So strategically, wouldn't it be best
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:56.720]   to build the best relationships with the best big brand name
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.280]   VCs and then just follow along with as much as they do?
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.080]   Yeah, they don't want-- that's not how it works.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:07.840]   That's not how everybody wants to follow the best VCs.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.040]   And so who decides who the follow is?
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.280]   Typically, the follow is actually earlier investors.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.760]   Earlier investors who invested in the beginning will follow.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.680]   There's not usually that many new investors following.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.440]   And the new investors following, normally, the company
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.600]   will decide or the venture firms will trade deals.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.240]   I see.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.120]   I'll let you follow into this great company
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.440]   if you let me follow into your great company.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.520]   There's a value.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.160]   The follow needs to bring some value, and usually values
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.120]   some kind of like quid pro quo.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.480]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.440]   Yeah, it's really hard to follow.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:53.400]   We followed Vanta, but that was like we had a relationship.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.200]   And so I think over time, we will deliver--
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.160]   we have some really interesting strategies that
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.480]   will deliver greater and greater value,
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.520]   and we will be able to follow.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.320]   But another thing that's happened,
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.280]   you may notice, in the last year or two,
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.600]   is that great companies aren't raising money.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.440]   What are they doing?
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.920]   You can't follow if they don't raise.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.600]   And they're not going to raise because they raised previously
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.760]   at a really high valuation, and they
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.360]   don't want to do down round.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.600]   What if they run out of money, though?
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.400]   They got 18 months.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.080]   Most of these great companies raised
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.800]   unbelievable amounts of money.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.000]   Unbelievable amounts of money.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.080]   So it's like a funny thing.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.240]   You talk to a company, they raise money
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.200]   at 400 times revenue.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.680]   And they have half a billion dollars in the bank.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.800]   Are they going to raise?
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.440]   Nope.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.080]   And they're burning $50 million.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.920]   They have 10 years of money in the bank.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.840]   So what happened is that--
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.440]   it was a challenge for us initially--
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.120]   that the best companies all had a lot of money
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.200]   and weren't going to raise.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.400]   And so then you're stuck.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.900]   The only people raising money were the second best companies
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.840]   or the not good companies.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.120]   And then you're raising in a down round.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:15.120]   And a down round has all sorts of bad juju, bad dynamics,
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.400]   bad structure, all sorts of problems.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.840]   That's a whole separate thing.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.380]   So now you're basically coming into something that's already
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.920]   sort of problematic.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.760]   It's a down round.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.600]   I mean, you can manage it in some cases,
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.840]   but it's not a good dynamic.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.080]   So normally what was happening is
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.400]   companies didn't want to take down rounds.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.440]   And so they were taking structured rounds
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.840]   or dirty term sheets.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.720]   So they would basically trade valuation, headline valuation.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.960]   So they'd say, OK, my company was worth $3 billion,
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.760]   but really it's only worth $500 million.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.400]   I'm going to tell everybody, I'll
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.320]   say I'm a financial investor.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.160]   I'll let you say it's worth $3 billion, but on the side,
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.080]   I'm going to have a side letter with you where
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.520]   I'm going to get warrants, and I'm going to get two times
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.480]   liquidation preference.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.160]   I'm going to get all these sort of financial structures.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.720]   Basically, you have a headline where
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.560]   you can tell your employees and everybody
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.000]   that you didn't have a down round,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.800]   but actually you did have a down round.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.520]   And those structured term sheets,
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:21.160]   those dirty term sheets, it causes all sorts of problems.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.080]   No, I hear you.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.640]   So in terms of--
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.120]   it sounds like a very competitive process
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.800]   to get the best deals.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.280]   And I know that you, Fundrise Innovation Fund,
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.000]   recently invested in Inspectify.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.760]   And I was reading about the company, and it sounds great.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.960]   PropTech, it has an app that consolidates
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.240]   all the process of doing the inspection, home inspection.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.600]   And Fundrise itself is a super user
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.040]   where Inspectify has done at least,
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.000]   sounds like 5,000 inspections for Fundrise properties.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   So I can see the synergies in that investment.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.800]   And it looks like a $4 million investment
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:07.520]   at only a $47 million valuation.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.360]   Sounds good to me with the synergies involved
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.800]   and with the pain it is to do these inspections
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.200]   for institutional investors or larger, smaller landlords.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.040]   Because I've gone through the process before,
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.720]   and it's quite cumbersome.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.920]   So I can see, as an investor in the innovation fund,
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.640]   the value add there and why Inspectify
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.680]   would want Fundrise to be on the board or as a lead investor.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.640]   But can you talk about the other companies?
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.200]   Because I look at the innovation fund
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.760]   and I see artificial intelligence and machine
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.320]   learning as one of the areas to invest in,
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.760]   modern data infrastructure, development operations,
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.920]   financial technology, and then real estate and property
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.320]   technology.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.080]   So how does the innovation fund identify and get
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.560]   access to the best deals in those other categories?
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.960]   That's a really good question.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.920]   So clearly, we are value add for Inspectify.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.440]   And Inspectify is awesome.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.320]   It's even better than you realize,
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.840]   which we can talk about that as a specific investment.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.600]   But you had two questions.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.800]   You said, how do we identify?
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.960]   And you could also include an identification valuation.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.720]   You have to know it's good.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.120]   And then a separate thing, how do you get access?
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.920]   And so let me do access first.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.800]   Because we've been buying and investing in these companies
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.200]   by buying from existing shareholders who have to sell,
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.000]   who want to sell.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.680]   And the company basically just has to approve it.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.240]   And we find basically that they-- whatever.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.920]   We bought shares from what looked
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.440]   like an intern in a company that's actually
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.520]   gone just through the roof.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.120]   I mean, it's probably one of the greatest companies happening
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.280]   in the world today.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.400]   And when we invest basically in some early employee
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.320]   they're selling-- like, I don't know if he's--
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.480]   I feel like he's sold because he's like, well,
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.840]   I made a couple million dollars.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.240]   I'm just going to--
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.360]   fine, I'm happy.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.960]   And the company had to approve it.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.840]   And actually, in this instance, the company said, OK,
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.400]   we'll approve it.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.800]   And you can come on our cap table.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   But you can't tell anybody who the company is.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.300]   Huh.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:21.800]   [LAUGHS]
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.040]   It's like, OK, well, fine, I'll take that.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.080]   So the company has to approve it.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.240]   But by and large, the companies have
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.120]   been OK with approving it.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.960]   Like, they don't-- we're replacing some early investor
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.520]   or some early employee with us.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.680]   We're a long-term investor.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.840]   We're not a seller.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.000]   And so they've been approving it.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.400]   So that's how we've been able to get access.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.560]   And it's been-- because the market for secondaries
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.840]   is very inefficient.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.560]   It is such a mess.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.800]   I mean, just this random broker gets this random person
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.400]   selling.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.760]   And they call random people.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.240]   So it's like a very inefficient market.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:06.960]   And that's great.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.520]   That's a great thing.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.240]   OK.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.080]   I guess it's great--
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.320]   That's the answer to this question.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.920]   --if you know what you're doing and if you can buy it
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.800]   at a valuation you think is below what the long-term
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.840]   valuation will be.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.320]   Well, that's not exactly how I would frame it.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.520]   Well, in terms of buying the shares from the interning,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.880]   let's clarify that a little bit.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.920]   Because the company says you can't tell anybody.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.920]   But as an investor in the innovation fund,
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.440]   I need to know what I'm investing in.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.200]   So--
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:33.960]   It's not normal.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.440]   That's not a normal thing.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.640]   Normally, yeah, we can-- I mean, it was a special company
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.720]   with special circumstances.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.560]   Normally, it's like-- yeah, the company just says,
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.280]   great, you're on my cap table.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.840]   And for example, we bought Service Titan.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.600]   Service Titan is like-- according to-- it's
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.560]   on the Bessemer's 100, which Bessemer's a famous venture
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.060]   fund.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.960]   I think it's number seven on Bessemer's list.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.880]   And we ended up on Service Titan's cap table.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:07.680]   And whatever, that was the end of it.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.560]   Like, it was just like, approved.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.080]   So and then you said like, are you
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.120]   focused on buying it at a great long-term price?
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:25.120]   And I think of it as the company that is growing explosively.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.080]   This is what we-- if anybody paid any attention to 2010s,
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.360]   like, the great companies went to valuations
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.280]   that were just-- blew people's mind in retrospect.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.520]   Because they grew so much.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.040]   That's why in venture, the power law,
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:46.880]   the sort of asymmetrical outcomes, the 1 in 100
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.960]   drives all the returns.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.600]   And so you're obsessed with getting
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.880]   into the sort of like, the best, best companies.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.880]   That like a Google-- take Google or Facebook.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.200]   Both times when they raised money for their series B,
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:05.000]   or A, or C, I think it was at crazy valuations.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.720]   Oh my god, who would pay $2 billion for Google?
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.600]   Who'd pay $1 billion for Facebook?
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.280]   So valuation is important.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.860]   But the quality of the company and the quality of the growth
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:21.160]   is way more important in growth investment,
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.760]   high, high, high growth investment.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.260]   Got it.
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.800]   Got it.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.520]   Everybody has been talking about AI recently.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.640]   And it sounds like AI is going to be a long-term trend.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.800]   How do you look at the five categories of investments?
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.320]   Do you break it up by 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20% to get to 100%?
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.760]   Or do you have flexibility in terms of how you're
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.280]   going to structure the fund?
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.420]   Yeah, I mean, the categories are not prescriptive.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.580]   You really want to invest in the best companies.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.900]   And that's the most important thing.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:01.660]   And so AI, when we launched the fund a year ago,
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:06.700]   was not obvious to us the best category to invest in.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:12.460]   And then what's happened with the JATGBT, OpenAI,
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.260]   Large Language Model, Transformers,
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.820]   wherever you want to describe it,
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:22.660]   it's caused a sea change in opportunity.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.940]   And so it's become our primary focus.
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:32.220]   And that's really one of the most interesting things
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.820]   happening in the world.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.580]   And because of the popularity of AI,
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.580]   I'm assuming valuations have gone through the roof as well.
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.620]   So it's one of those things where
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.540]   you kind of have to balance that as well.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.500]   Yeah, yes.
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.700]   Well, so you have to basically get inside that to really have
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.980]   a better understanding of what to do.
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:58.860]   Because AI is-- even the word AI doesn't mean, actually,
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:59.820]   all that much.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.900]   It has sort of this broad definition.
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.740]   It's almost a movement as much as it is a technology.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.380]   And so what's happened--
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.020]   I mean, everybody probably knows all this, right?
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:18.540]   But basically, the hardware and the algorithms
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.860]   usually got to a place where they sort of like--
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:28.020]   they passed some cusp where it enabled a whole set
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.900]   of new applications.
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.700]   And that sort of dynamic actually
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.060]   is the way tech and venture works.
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.460]   So the pattern is you have a new piece of hardware.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.220]   So you take a mainframe.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.740]   Mainframe to PC was a change in hardware.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.400]   And you could also go before mainframe.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.860]   There were punch card machines.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.460]   IBM was a punch card machine company.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:52.460]   Or PC to the internet, or the internet to mobile,
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.980]   or mobile to cloud.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:59.260]   There's like basic technology innovations that happen.
[00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.380]   And so take mobile as an example.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.660]   Mobile was a combination of what happened with Spectrum,
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:10.260]   and Qualcomm, and Apple, and basically it was hardware.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.580]   And then inside-- so that's like the bottom of the stack.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.140]   And you go up to the sort of middle of the stack, which
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.300]   different people have different ways to describe it.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.380]   But you call it sort of the platform.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.340]   That's what I think is a good handle for it.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.900]   And so the platform is like where software engineers play.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.140]   Like Twilio is a platform company, right?
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.100]   Consumers don't actually talk to Twilio.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.980]   Twilio is being used by software engineers
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.500]   to enable an application like Uber.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.500]   Uber is an application.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.660]   And so the App Store created an ability to have apps.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.860]   And the applications came after the hardware, right?
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:52.620]   Uber was 2011, but the iPhone was 2008.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.380]   So what's happened is that like NVIDIA,
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.660]   at the hardware level of AI, that's
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.180]   clearly blowing up and mature.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.180]   And then in the middle of the stack, which
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.340]   is the platform level, you have like clouds,
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.300]   and you have all this data infrastructure.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.420]   And then as you get to the top, the applications,
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:15.740]   there's very few.
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.460]   And I'm taking this from Tomasz Tangas, who's
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.220]   one of our partners.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.940]   But basically, if you look at the cloud,
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:27.380]   cloud companies are worth $3 trillion,
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.300]   or something like that.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:34.140]   And that's Amazon, AWS, and Google, and Microsoft.
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.540]   And there's like four or five cloud companies.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:38.780]   And they're worth $3 trillion.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:42.340]   And there's 100 apps that are public that
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.060]   are worth $3 trillion, worth about the same.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:49.540]   And apps are like Snowflake or ServiceNow or something, right?
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:53.540]   So that same thing's happening in AI.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.380]   The apps basically haven't been invented, really.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:59.060]   Or if they have, nobody knows about them, other than maybe
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.460]   chat GPT.
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.060]   And everything that's sort of happened is like infrastructure,
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.860]   platform layer, apps.
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:12.220]   And so this is actually always how it happens.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.380]   Maturity moves its way up the stack.
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:21.020]   And so we can play AI different places in the stack.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.460]   And so the data infrastructure, which
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:28.620]   is sort of the platform level underneath of AI,
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.060]   you could also think of it as like if there's a gold rush,
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.020]   you can try to find gold, or you can sell picks and shovels.
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.740]   Data infrastructure are the picks and shovels.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:40.140]   Everybody needs these technologies
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.740]   to be able to do the stuff that is the application.
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.420]   And we've been investing like crazy
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.740]   into the picks and shovels, because that's clear.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.180]   And yes, and pricing, like the LLMs.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:58.220]   The LLMs are-- there's only really five major--
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.740]   What's an LLM?
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.980]   Large Language Model.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.220]   Yeah, Large Language Model.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.980]   So OpenAI or chat GPT is like the biggest, most famous LLM.
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.420]   They've kind of, in a way, like reinvented it.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.340]   Because it was invented by Google, actually,
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.180]   funny enough.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.660]   OpenAI is the biggest.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.700]   Then there's Anthropic, Cohere.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.220]   Databricks basically bought one.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.900]   So the point is there's-- because Nvidia sort of has one
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.340]   that's partnered with a company.
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:32.140]   So five LLMs or four LLMs, not that many.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:35.020]   And because as I said, the deeper you go into the stack,
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.100]   the less companies there are.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.780]   So there'll be less platforms than there are apps.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.380]   But there'll be more platforms than there are hardware
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.540]   companies.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:49.580]   And so in some of the cases, like we invested in Databricks.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.660]   Databricks is a platform company.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:55.780]   They are one of the great companies in the world
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.980]   right now.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.700]   So everybody who's in the tech space knows about Snowflake.
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.620]   And Snowflake's been absolutely on a tear.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.580]   Databricks is comparable to Snowflake
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.020]   in terms of opportunity and excellence.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.660]   My opinion, many ways better.
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.940]   And even better for what's happening
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.020]   in the world, which is that Databricks is really
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:20.460]   the go-to company for data rather than databases, which
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.060]   is a different kind of-- we're down in the weeds here.
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.860]   But we invested in Databricks.
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:31.300]   Databricks is-- to be able to get Databricks now and own
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.300]   a chunk of that company is just so exciting.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.620]   And they are integral.
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.020]   Like, it's a different risk profile.
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.220]   You're not taking sort of like, is this company
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.100]   going to be successful at risk?
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:48.940]   You're taking like, how much are they going to grow risk?
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.980]   And I think they're going to grow a lot.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.220]   How much did the innovation fund invest in Databricks,
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.140]   and at what valuation?
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.940]   We put $25 million into Databricks,
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.740]   and it's 25% of the fund, about.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.060]   So that's a really bullish--
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:05.980]   High conviction.
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.380]   High conviction idea.
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:07.880]   Yes.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:13.100]   At what valuation is Databricks?
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.380]   I would have to go check.
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.380]   One of the things that's sort of tricky for us
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:23.780]   is that the best companies, they don't--
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:29.420]   getting the valuation is not really what is good for them.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.260]   So if we invest-- not Databricks,
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.860]   but pick another company, we invested,
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:36.820]   and we invested a deep discount to their last round.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.780]   They don't like us talking about that.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:40.580]   OK.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.080]   Right.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:41.580]   All right.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.500]   So if we want to get the best companies,
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.620]   we don't run around talking about how we got them
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.980]   at great deep discounts.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.660]   Got it.
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.060]   I hear you.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:49.820]   I hear you.
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.140]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.780]   And I think the discount is sort of irrelevant.
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:59.580]   It's a question of what sort of price to growth ratio,
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.340]   or what do you--
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.260]   the discount is a nice way to back into that.
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:09.180]   If I look at their growth rates, I look at their opportunity,
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:13.740]   I look at basically the multiple I'm buying it at.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.780]   I don't really care if it's a discount or premium.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.900]   I care about the future.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.020]   What the future is.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.600]   Right, because this is a growth fund.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.420]   This is a private growth fund.
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.740]   So interesting.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.580]   So wow, 25% of the fund in Databricks.
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:28.300]   So we got to do a lot of reading on that.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.180]   But this is the thing.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.220]   I think as a common person, we couldn't have gained access
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.180]   to Databricks, right?
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.700]   We can't invest in Databricks.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.180]   It's a big secondary.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:38.900]   Right.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.380]   Are you allowed to reveal--
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.580]   actually, yeah, who were the lead investors in Databricks?
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.140]   Do you know off the top of your head?
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.500]   So the top VCs?
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.580]   The top, top, top.
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.120]   I mean, the other thing that happens
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:54.260]   with these sort of key platform companies
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.820]   is that you also see the cloud companies invest in them.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:02.020]   So you see Google and Microsoft and NVIDIA
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.940]   all invest into the sort of certain--
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.300]   that's another really interesting thing we've seen.
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.940]   Like, oh my god.
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.020]   It's like, who's who?
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.660]   And then the other thing about our underwrite,
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.880]   we talked about how we're different.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.420]   A lot of venture people are CS, computer science degree,
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.380]   real engineers who maybe went and did-- built a company
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.060]   or maybe went into finance.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:31.620]   But a lot of venture people are also just finance people.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.020]   I would say especially the late stage investors
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.620]   are mostly former investment bankers or management
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.180]   consultants.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.340]   We use the technology.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.500]   We have people on our team who live inside
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.340]   and build with these platforms.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.860]   Like, our ability to understand Databricks
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:57.100]   or go down the list of data orchestration or data
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.500]   governance-- we invest in a data governance company.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.900]   Our engineers-- I love having engineers involved with us
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.500]   underwriting companies because we can buy their software
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.660]   and use it.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.260]   Or we're already a big customer.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:14.820]   That's what happens to make them companies like us.
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.540]   And so our underwriting of technology,
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.060]   it's like a deep underwriting.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:24.620]   And so as the investor looking to invest in the innovation
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.820]   fund, I'll go to Fundrise and I'll
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:31.820]   look at the publicly stated 17 assets invested so far.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.660]   Not all are private.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.980]   When I look at the investment-- so let's say I say,
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.420]   oh, Inspectify.
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:38.740]   Looks like a no-brainer.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.380]   Wow.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.500]   Devaluation of the funding.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.060]   Last round of funding was only $47 million.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.380]   I think the total addressable market is much bigger
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.740]   and they can gain market share.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:51.620]   And it could be easily $500 million company.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.180]   When I invest my money in the fund now,
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.780]   it seems like I'm able to cherry pick or have
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.380]   a competitive advantage to say, oh, this is what you guys have?
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.540]   OK, I'm going to invest in it.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.540]   So how does an investor think about investing
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:11.220]   in a fund that already has investments?
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:14.220]   And how do those gains accrue to the investor,
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:18.540]   to the new investor, who didn't invest at the exact same time
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.660]   the fund invested in these specific companies?
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.820]   Right.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.460]   Let's try to do the mechanics of it and then the so what.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:32.660]   So the mechanics, investor buys into the fund.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:37.420]   The fund, let's say, round numbers, $100 million today.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.460]   Put in $1 million, you own 1% of the fund.
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.700]   And the fund has $100 million and buys or invests
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:49.060]   into Inspectify or Databricks or ServiceTitan or whomever.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:54.220]   And so you essentially own your 1% of those investments.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.420]   And if we make more investments, you
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.780]   would own a percentage of those investments, too.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:00.280]   It's a fund.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.860]   It's a portfolio.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.580]   It's like a mutual fund, except for it's a private company,
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.460]   not public companies.
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:11.420]   The pricing in the private market is very challenging.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.460]   So when we invest, obviously, that's a good sign.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.780]   That's the price.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.100]   When they raise the next round, that's
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:21.140]   usually the easiest way to kind of re-strike the nav.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.060]   And as we get more and more companies and more and more
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.980]   momentum, which we're getting some serious momentum
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.740]   these days, there'll be more and more companies raising.
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.060]   If you have 100 companies, which would be a lot,
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:38.220]   but let's say we have 30, probably every company
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.860]   raises every 18 months.
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.020]   You'll start seeing fairly frequent repricing.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.820]   And it can go down, too, by the way,
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.260]   just to make my regulator happy.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:51.220]   Companies can go out of business or raise at a lower round
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.780]   or have some kind of distress.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:42:00.180]   And our job is to basically try to price it as best we can.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.580]   And usually, the best way to do that
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:06.100]   is a strong external signal.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:10.540]   And so when something's going to reprice up or down,
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:14.540]   like a company, I think that in the beginning,
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.980]   there's less momentum, less repricing.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:20.300]   As we get more momentum, there'll be more repricing.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.940]   And I think it'll be harder to try to time that.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:24.980]   Sure.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.500]   Yeah, because as a normal, let's say,
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.060]   public stock or bond investor, you buy it.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.020]   And that's day one.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:33.980]   And you gain or lose.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:38.740]   And for other venture capital funds that I've invested in,
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:40.580]   so we commit capital.
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.180]   And then there's capital calls over a two- to three-year
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.380]   period.
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:48.020]   But given we committed capital at the start of the fund,
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.980]   the logic is we accrue all the gains as the investments come
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:53.860]   in and go out.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.380]   And so with the innovation fund, you've got capital.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.180]   You've committed the capital.
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.740]   And then it's open to new capital.
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.180]   So understanding the mechanics is helpful.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.500]   And so when I look at the portfolio, let's say--
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.060]   let's just, for example, I know that one of the investments
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:15.180]   in Spectify is going to do a new round of funding at 10x--
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.300]   let's just say 10x the valuation that Fundrise Innovation
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.580]   Fund was able to invest in.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.580]   So instead of $47 million, it goes to $500 million
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.100]   in the next series.
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.420]   Could I think to myself-- or let's say it's Databricks,
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.580]   and Databricks is 25% of the fund.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.540]   And it raises at 10x, which it's not going to do, but maybe it,
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.660]   but 10x.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:40.580]   Would it not be strategically wise to then say, oh, OK, well,
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.500]   let me go invest as much as possible in the Fundrise fund
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.260]   before the NAV reprices?
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.660]   I mean, you're asking at least two different questions.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.780]   One is, if you have insider information--
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.220]   Let's not say insider information.
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:57.140]   Let's say you believe that it's going to be repriced.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:01.820]   Even that-- the definition of insider information
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.900]   applies to public companies.
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:08.140]   So I don't even know how insider information
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.300]   works for private companies.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.540]   That's confusing to me.
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:16.300]   But obviously, if you have an asymmetrical information
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:20.260]   advantage, that's how a lot of markets work.
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:23.340]   I think it's unlikely that you would have that very often.
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.780]   Most people don't know when--
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.620]   most people don't even know if they've ever
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.980]   heard of these companies.
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:33.940]   This is like-- you have to be pretty deep in to actually
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.580]   know a lot about the company.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.820]   And then you have to know they're going to raise again.
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:40.900]   So I think that's going to happen pretty unusual--
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.340]   it's not going to be common.
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:43.900]   Right.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.060]   I know it's not going to be common.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.060]   It's just more like a thought exercise
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.900]   in terms of how an open-ended venture fund works.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:54.300]   Because let's say I have a friend who works at Databricks.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.660]   They're based in San Francisco.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.780]   I play softball with them.
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:57.540]   And I'm like, ah.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.540]   And he's like, ah, Sam, the business is doing great.
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.940]   And we're probably going to raise a new round of funding.
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.940]   That's just hanging out on the softball field.
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:05.860]   Oh, really?
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.500]   OK, you're going to raise new-- and the business is going great.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:09.860]   It's a private company.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.140]   He doesn't really know exactly.
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.540]   But it's like, OK, pretty good.
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.340]   Oh.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.740]   Oh, and Fundrise Innovation Fund invests in Databricks.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:19.260]   Maybe I should invest in the fund,
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:22.340]   because I can't directly invest in Databricks.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.260]   Yeah, or there's an article in the information
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.500]   that Databricks may raise another round.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.780]   And you look at it, and you're like, hmm,
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.940]   I wonder what price they're going to raise.
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.580]   And in the article, they say, we're
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.020]   not going to raise a discount.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:42.180]   So yeah, this is like-- I think you're asking somebody
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.580]   almost something very narrow in a way, because I think that's--
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:49.740]   again, I just don't think that's a systematic dynamic.
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:54.020]   I think it's much more about, OK,
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.700]   I think that it's hard to reprice Inspectify.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.860]   Let's say I-- I know Inspectify is-- let's say,
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.260]   in theory, they're killing it.
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.420]   They're doing really well.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:06.500]   And I should talk about just one minute
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:11.060]   why I think Inspectify is better than you might think,
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.180]   even though I think what you said was good.
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.680]   But if I knew their growing revenue and the growing revenue
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.860]   but haven't raised a round, it's harder for us
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:21.420]   to actually strike the naff.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.420]   Or if I knew that they were-- this is a company.
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.300]   Maybe they're down for six months.
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.740]   It doesn't mean they won't be-- they won't revert to the mean
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:30.500]   and catch back up.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.380]   That happened to us in 2020.
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:37.900]   Our fundraising and our growth slowed during the pandemic.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.940]   And then it reverted back to the mean.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.780]   So it's really hard to price these companies.
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:46.860]   It's really difficult. The hope is that once you have more
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:51.220]   and more companies-- and we have a decent number already--
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.860]   it's hard to play inside those intervals.
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.900]   I think it's challenging.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:56.780]   Got it.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:01.340]   I mean, it is almost kind of like a belief play,
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.920]   a macro play, where do you believe
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.740]   these technologies and these categories
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.820]   are going to revolutionize and change the future and grow?
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.780]   And if you do, you need to take--
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.380]   you can take a fund approach where the fund invests
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:15.860]   in multiple companies.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.820]   Or you can take an individual angel or direct private
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.180]   investment approach, which I don't really recommend.
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.980]   Because you don't have any edge as an individual, especially
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.140]   as a common individual.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.980]   Super hard to get access to these companies.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:27.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.180]   And so I'm just always thinking about it
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.980]   as a strategic investor in the way I think about it.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.340]   Because I always try to think about the future.
[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.920]   And so yeah, if the rising tide lifts all boats
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.620]   in these specific five categories, for example,
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:45.380]   then obviously the innovation fund will probably ride with it.
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.940]   There's no guarantees on returns,
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:48.820]   but it'll ride with it.
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.140]   So I'm just trying to think from an investor,
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:54.100]   potential investor's point of view, how to think about it.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.180]   You've got the macro.
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.020]   You've got technology.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.740]   And you're able to look at the existing portfolio.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.100]   And as we talk here today, it sounds
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.620]   like there are a lot more opportunities on the horizon.
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.900]   And as the fund raises more capital,
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.380]   you will reinvest that capital in those specific
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.780]   opportunities.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.740]   Yeah, I mean, I have a broad view--
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.940]   and this is like runs counter to most people
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.220]   in the investment business-- is that the macro is more
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:24.500]   important than you as a manager.
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.060]   And that's like-- because everybody sells their sells.
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.020]   Sure, everybody's talking their books.
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.780]   Everybody's saying, I'm such a great manager.
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:36.500]   But all those venture people who were a genius in 2019
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.500]   didn't look so smart in 2022, right?
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:44.300]   So I mean, there's obviously skill.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:45.300]   You have to get access.
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.540]   You have to be able to pick good companies.
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:50.900]   But I think that picking the good companies
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.220]   is not as hard as you might think
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:56.020]   if you are picking the best--
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.380]   Right.
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.380]   Go look at the top 20 companies.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.860]   It seems like really it's access.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:04.260]   It's like the rich get richer.
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:08.300]   The alumni of the private college institutions
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.740]   and their legacy admissions, they
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.740]   get in easier by 5 to 8x.
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:14.820]   So it is access, folks.
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.340]   And this is kind of the reality of the world.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.460]   I know the venture world relatively well
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.580]   because I have a lot of friends in the venture world
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.540]   because I'm here in San Francisco, Kleiner,
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:26.300]   and I have other parents who are in the venture world.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.940]   And it's really about access.
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:33.580]   Access, access, and man, I went to this holiday party
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.980]   at one of the top venture funds.
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:39.780]   So many other VCs from other competing funds
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.940]   were there because it's all about, OK, I'm
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:43.660]   going to invest in Series A. And I
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.220]   know someone at another fund who's
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.340]   going to support the Series B, and then Series C,
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.260]   and then there's IPO.
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:54.180]   So relationships and access, it truly
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:57.220]   is more important because we already know, or a lot of us
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:59.700]   know, which are the top companies that you
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:01.340]   want to gain access to.
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:01.860]   Right.
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:05.540]   And so there's a bunch of implications of that.
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.460]   And you didn't say this part, but then there's
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:08.580]   this regulatory barrier.
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.660]   Normal people can't even invest in it.
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.460]   They're not allowed to.
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.260]   The companies have to be public.
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:17.340]   So you have two different barriers.
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:22.140]   And we created a way to surmount the first one, which
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:25.260]   is a regulatory barrier, and the second one
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:28.660]   was a human barrier.
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:34.740]   And we've been able to surmount that so far.
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:38.740]   And I think we will continue to-- I can see a line of sight
[00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:42.380]   to I feel like we're confident about the, let's say,
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:45.300]   the next short period, like three months, six months,
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:45.800]   a year.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.720]   Obviously, it's hard to say what two years are
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.260]   going to look like from now.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:54.220]   But the thing about venture is that winning
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:58.780]   is the best strategy because it causes more winning.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.960]   If you have the best companies and we
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:06.300]   have a really supportive investor base who's like--
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:10.060]   we bring 2 million users to the table.
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:13.740]   Like when Inspectify-- when we sent out our email
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:18.340]   to our investors saying, hey, we invested in Inspectify,
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:20.860]   Inspectify's web traffic doubled.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:21.460]   Sure.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.300]   So very hugely value added.
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:31.580]   They got 100 sales leads, which in B2B business is a lot.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:35.320]   And so if we can get more investors,
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:39.220]   we're more valuable to the companies we invest in.
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:41.620]   And so that's like our long-term play
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.740]   is that basically we bring something
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.540]   to the table that's different than what-- Sequoia
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.220]   brings all sorts of things to the table.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.340]   They don't bring 2 million investors.
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:53.460]   Right.
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.620]   That's what I think is our kind of like-- so that's like,
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:59.020]   how do we keep scaling and maintain quality?
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:01.660]   Is there's a potential network effect.
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:02.540]   Right.
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:04.780]   No, that's absolutely true because it's
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:06.340]   so hard to gain access.
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.540]   The company will say, what can you
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.020]   do besides bringing capital?
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.700]   Because capital is kind of a commodity, right?
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.540]   Everybody-- there are a lot of people with a lot of money
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:17.020]   and a lot of institutions with a lot of money.
[00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.060]   So what is the value add you can provide?
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:20.720]   And that's actually something that I've
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.620]   been thinking about as well with Financial Samurai
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.060]   and investing in private companies.
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.220]   Like, well, my value add is I have a platform that I
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.100]   can help market your product.
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.940]   And so that is something I've thought about.
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:34.140]   But as a stay-at-home dad raising two young kids,
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:37.420]   there's a lot going on already.
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:40.180]   So in terms of investing in the fund
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:43.620]   and then gaining liquidity from the fund,
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:46.820]   it's a time horizon of five plus years, maybe longer.
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:50.620]   Whenever I invest in venture and venture debt,
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:53.020]   I think about a 10-year horizon.
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:55.340]   And I hope I don't die before the 10 years, obviously.
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:57.740]   But if I do, then my heirs will be
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.380]   able to get the distributions.
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:04.020]   So how should investors think about liquidity,
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:08.860]   getting exits from the fund, as well as also,
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:12.380]   what would you say is the recommended percentage
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:16.060]   of one's investable assets they should invest
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:19.700]   in private growth VC funds?
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:20.200]   Right.
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.340]   Well, let me do the first one.
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:23.980]   The second one is a very hard one.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:28.420]   It's personalized circumstances.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:32.580]   So we created something new, which is basically a venture
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:34.620]   fund that the public can invest in.
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:38.060]   And the underlying assets, which are companies like Serviceite
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:42.300]   and your Databricks, which are not liquid,
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:46.420]   we can sell our shares on the secondary market.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:50.340]   But it's going to be hard to do, because it's very inefficient
[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:52.700]   and maybe not get very good pricing,
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.620]   if you can get any pricing.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:58.260]   Because usually when you want liquidity,
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:01.060]   there's no liquidity to get.
[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.620]   That's the way liquidity works.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:03.940]   It's bimodal.
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:09.700]   So we believe we have to hold a chunk of the fund
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:13.420]   in public liquid assets.
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:17.420]   That's why what we have done so far
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:22.340]   is we've been holding cash in money markets, which
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:28.500]   is not so bad, and in public tech debt, bonds.
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.740]   We bought a lot of-- the bond market
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.340]   was sort of fractured last year.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.180]   And so we bought $30-plus million
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:42.100]   of fractured or broken bond offerings.
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:44.740]   So we got some really good pricing.
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.020]   But it's not really where maybe we'll
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:50.180]   get single digit yields or something.
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:54.540]   But it's not really what we're-- it's there for liquidity,
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.600]   because investors expect things to be liquid,
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.020]   even if it's a strategy.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:03.460]   How long does it take Inspectify to become--
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.900]   to fulfill its potential?
[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.980]   That's a long time.
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:13.020]   And most investors, they want to get liquid on their timeline,
[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:14.740]   not on the company's timeline.
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:17.740]   And so we had to create this hybrid vehicle.
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:20.900]   And that's how we've done it.
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:23.980]   And so that answers my question on, oh,
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:27.800]   why are there publicly holdings in the fund?
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:31.800]   So the primary reason is to provide liquidity
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.600]   when people want it?
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.780]   Yeah, and also, if there's a $25 million investment to be had,
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:39.880]   you can write that check.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:40.900]   Right.
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:41.960]   Right, right, right, right.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:42.520]   Got it.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.680]   That's interesting, because traditional VCs,
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:45.520]   they don't do that.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.080]   They don't have that liquidity.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.800]   You wait 5 to 10 years.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.880]   So exactly when is the earliest someone could get liquidity?
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:54.560]   Because if I'm in--
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:55.440]   so it's quarterly.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.960]   Every quarter, yeah.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.840]   And how much of that liquidity?
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.400]   Let's say I invest $100 grand.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:06.320]   Yeah, we hold enough liquidity that I'm not worried
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:08.800]   about people needing to get liquid.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:12.080]   It's similar to the real estate, where we have
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.520]   quarterly liquidity available.
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:20.640]   It's a little different, because the tech fund can not
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.000]   have liquidity, where the real estate funds are required
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.440]   to have 5% liquidity every quarter.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.100]   But the real estate is much more liquid.
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.360]   You can always sell a building.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.440]   I can't force Databricks to go public.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.240]   Sure.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.440]   So it's a little less liquid than real estate.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:40.000]   But we manage liquidity by having, essentially,
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.800]   like a portfolio that includes liquid public assets.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.560]   So can we just talk about an example?
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.080]   Let's say I invest $100,000 in the fund.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.120]   And for some reason, I need liquidity.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:57.040]   How much of that $100,000 can I get back?
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.320]   Yeah, you would hit--
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:01.160]   you go into our app, hit Redemption.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:05.440]   And in the quarter, we pay $100,000.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.080]   Oh, 100%.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:13.920]   So that's a good option to have for people, just in case
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.160]   they need liquidity.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.240]   Definitely, for folks listening, don't
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:22.160]   invest in private funds with five-plus-year time horizons
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.600]   if you need the liquidity within five years.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.000]   You need to properly asset allocation
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.200]   your funds accordingly.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.280]   Because sometimes when you need liquidity, as Ben said,
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.840]   you might not get liquidity, or you
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.760]   might have to sell at a larger discount than you desire.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.800]   So there is a situation, Ben, where let's say--
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.920]   I don't know-- there's another huge financial crisis,
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.200]   and people just need liquidity.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.720]   Being able to pay back 100% liquidity from all investors
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.880]   is going to be impossible, because not the entire fund is
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:53.880]   liquid.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:56.440]   Well, so two points.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:00.800]   One, 100% of people wanting liquidity at the same time
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.400]   is not going to happen.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:06.120]   I mean, you have is like our normal liquidity demand.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:10.360]   Normally, there's some number of people who want liquidity.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:14.040]   Currently on the fund, it's infinitesimal.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.600]   On other funds that are more mature,
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.720]   we've been doing this for 10 years.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:22.720]   It's pretty statistically predictable for us,
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.840]   because it's across hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:31.920]   So it's like-- and it's highly correlated to the S&P 500,
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:33.040]   actually.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:40.720]   So it's not that hard, actually, to manage against it.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.960]   But with the venture-- but with the real estate, again,
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.520]   with the real estate, we can sell real estate.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.880]   We do sell real estate.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:50.960]   With tech, it's a slightly different fund structure,
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:55.480]   because the underlying asset is the most--
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.600]   arguably one of the most illiquid assets out there.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.440]   Right.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.680]   So again, folks, if you invest in a venture capital
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:05.200]   fund that's private companies, you really
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.200]   have to invest with a five-plus-year horizon.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.880]   Be consistent with the goal of the fund,
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.520]   and allocate illiquid capital to illiquid investments,
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.920]   and then vice versa.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.080]   We want to talk about our second question, was what percentage
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.640]   do you think is a wise percentage to invest
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:28.040]   in private companies' private funds?
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.040]   I have my own views, but I'd love to hear yours.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:34.480]   I feel like my chief appliance officer would go crazy
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:36.840]   if I was answering that question.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:40.280]   I could answer it like the sale of-- like institutions
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.400]   hold 20% to 30% of their assets illiquid assets.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:47.560]   I think it's the wealthier you are,
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.440]   the more liquid you can be.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.160]   Right.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:55.760]   And so it's very circumstantial.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.000]   We have people redeeming every day from our site,
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.480]   and we always ask them, why are you redeeming?
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.720]   And the most common reasons are buying a house.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.880]   There's life reasons.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.720]   Sure.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:11.840]   And so yeah, there's no objective answer to that.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.340]   Got it.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.520]   And that makes sense.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.720]   If you look at the Yale Endowment Fund,
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.480]   it's something like $30 plus billion.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:23.080]   Something like 70%, 80% of its asset allocation
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:28.480]   is in private or illiquid funds or investments.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:32.320]   And so folks, the reason why the wealthier you are,
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.060]   the more illiquid you can be, is because the remaining smaller
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.720]   percentage of your liquid net worth
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.160]   is still a large, absolute dollar amount.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:46.000]   So if you are worth $10 million and you put 80%
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.040]   in illiquid funds, well, you still
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.800]   have $2 million of accessible liquidity.
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.840]   And of course, it depends on your cash flow.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.760]   Personally, I like to invest no more than 20% of my net worth
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.000]   in private companies and private funds
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.240]   because, well, I don't have tens and tens of millions of dollars,
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.920]   and that's just my capital allocation.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.000]   So everybody has to figure out on their own,
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.520]   but also be really consistent with their liquidity goals
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.480]   and understand your cash flow and understand your future
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.080]   and what you need.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:16.760]   All right, Ben.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:19.120]   So is there anything else we should talk about regarding
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.520]   the fund and what the future holds for the fund?
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:26.080]   What is the ideal scenario for the fund in the next one
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.600]   to two years in your mind?
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.440]   Yeah, I mean, I can't believe how lucky we are
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.960]   because the AI revolution is maybe
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.880]   the biggest technological change in our lifetime.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.280]   I mean, going from creating the internet,
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.320]   created tons of companies, tons of value,
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.720]   and creating mobile, mobile didn't, cloud did.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:52.160]   So this is like-- Goldman Sachs came out
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.280]   saying they thought it could double GDP growth.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.920]   And they measured-- they said that they
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.560]   could have 500 times the productivity gains
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.160]   than a personal computer did.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.120]   So the amount of value created and captured here
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.520]   is going to be astronomical.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.040]   And that has nothing to do with us.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.680]   We just happened on the scene when that's happening.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.880]   And our job is to basically just to get in the middle of that
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.280]   as much as possible because that's what's happening today.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.040]   And that's the opportunity.
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.160]   It's just unbelievable.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.040]   Right.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.160]   To focus-- well, first, identify investment trends
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.760]   and get on that rocket ship and not really care
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.840]   where's your seat, right?
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.000]   That famous quote, just identify that rocket ship and get on.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.080]   Because if you can focus on the investment trends
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.040]   and focus on the big picture, the macro,
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.920]   a lot of the other stuff will take care of itself.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.800]   And I know there's going to be some blowups here and there
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:56.800]   because there always are in new riskier investments.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.040]   But if you can focus on that trend,
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.360]   I think good things will happen.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.920]   So how many investments would you
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.760]   think would be ideal for the fund?
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.400]   Is there a cap on the limit?
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.640]   Is there a cap on the size of the fund?
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.360]   The fund is a registered--
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.920]   or sorry, regulated investment corporation,
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:22.080]   which basically has certain diversification parameters.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.480]   So for example, we can't have more than 25% of the fund
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.880]   in one company.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.640]   We have approximately 25% in one company.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.760]   And so there's a--
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.260]   I don't need to get into the details,
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:38.000]   but basically you're not supposed to have more than--
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.720]   well, I'll do this because I'm a detailed person.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.040]   But half the company, half of the portfolio
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.000]   can be concentrated, and then the other half
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.240]   has to be diversified.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.840]   What does concentrated mean?
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.720]   Concentrated means technically not more than half.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.360]   So half has to be in at least two companies.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.640]   So a quarter, right?
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.140]   Yeah.
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:00.840]   Quarter max.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.080]   So that's fairly concentrated.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:05.560]   The other half, no one company can be more than 5%
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.000]   of the fund.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:07.500]   Interesting.
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:13.920]   So you end up with 22 companies is the kind of requirement
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.480]   from a--
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.320]   Minimum?
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.880]   From a RIC, a regulated investment corporation
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.080]   sort of structure.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:24.000]   And what that lets you do is the fund then is tax free.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.880]   There's no corporate tax at the fund level if you're a RIC.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.640]   So that's why you want to conform to those regulations.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.140]   Tax free.
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:35.160]   So that's like the minimum.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.800]   Can you talk about what that means to the consumer?
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.120]   Because what do you mean the fund has to pay taxes?
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:45.760]   Fund is tax-- no, the fund is-- there's no tax at the fund
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.400]   level if you're a regulated investment corporation,
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.640]   if you're a RIC.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.360]   So it's a pass-through entity.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.360]   So why would a fund ever not want to follow and be a RIC?
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.600]   Most venture funds are not RICs.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.120]   Most venture funds are LLCs.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:09.560]   I mean, now you're getting deep into insurance law and tax.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:11.240]   Yeah, let's not get into that.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.960]   But interesting, interesting.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.120]   OK, so 22.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.760]   So it sounds like you'll have at least 22.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.800]   But what if there's a situation-- because eventually,
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.160]   it can get so big that, actually, it
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.080]   could be good from a risk perspective.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.840]   But could you envision the fund having 65 investments?
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.840]   Or is that just getting out of control there?
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.160]   It's hard to say at the moment.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.660]   Because to some extent, it doesn't really
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:38.000]   matter the number of investments.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.300]   It depends on the dollar size.
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.560]   So we've made some small investments.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.280]   And the reason I make a small investment
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.280]   is I can get on the cap table and get to know the company.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.440]   And the more you know the company,
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.960]   the more conviction you can get.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.040]   And then you can say, oh, this is a great company,
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.720]   and I want to invest more.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.240]   Right.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.840]   So that's a whole different strategy.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.840]   Your foot in the door.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.280]   Yeah, it's not the first check that matters.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.040]   It's the size of the check that matters.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.680]   Mm, yeah.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:09.800]   Well, it sounds great.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.280]   It sounds like there's a great opportunity.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.440]   It definitely seems like all these technologies
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.240]   are the wave of the future.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.640]   Ben, for those who are interested in investing
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.240]   in the Fundrise Innovation Fund, what
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.280]   is the minimum required to invest in the fund?
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.200]   And what are the fees?
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:31.880]   So the minimum is $10, which is our mission to make it,
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.680]   to lower the barriers.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.040]   And the fees are much less than a normal venture fund.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.880]   So a normal venture fund charges $2.20.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.200]   It's a 2% annual asset management fee.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.480]   And then a 20% carried interest for $20.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.960]   And then a 20% carried interest for 20% of the profits.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.520]   Some charge more than that.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:53.000]   Some charge-- I think Benchmark charges 30% of the profits.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.320]   We have no carried interest.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:59.240]   So we just charge a 1.85% annual asset management fee.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:03.040]   So less than venture charges for annual asset management
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:07.480]   and no carried interest, zero profit participation.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:08.400]   Right.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.200]   Now, that's good, because I'm definitely
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.760]   invested in a fund that is-- I think it's 3-plus percent
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.040]   and 30% carried interest.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.760]   And it's one of the top funds out there.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.080]   So I was like, well, again, it's about access.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.880]   All right, well, you heard it here, folks.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.360]   $10 to get into-- to start investing
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.160]   in these technologies and companies.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.160]   That is pretty revolutionary, folks,
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.880]   because as a credit investor, a lot of these funds,
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:38.440]   you have to invest a minimum $200,000, $250,000, at least
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.400]   $100,000 in the friends and family rounds that I've seen.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.000]   And a lot of times, there's just no supply.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.760]   You just can't get in.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.020]   So thank you for sharing that information
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:51.760]   and democratizing that access to venture capital,
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.080]   because I don't know if I've heard
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:59.600]   of any other $10 investment minimum out there.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.160]   So sounds great.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.320]   All right, Ben, well, it was great chatting with you
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.200]   for the past hour plus.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.760]   We will speak again, hopefully at the end of the year
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:11.040]   or in the new year, to talk about real estate, your views,
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.760]   and whether they've changed at all.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:15.240]   You can listen to a previous episode we had.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.000]   And also, thank you, Fundrise, for being a supporter
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.240]   and sponsor of Financial Samurai all these years.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.720]   I really appreciate it.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:23.280]   And until we speak again--
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.680]   Yeah, onward.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.080]   --onward.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.000]   Well, everyone, I hope you enjoyed today's podcast episode
