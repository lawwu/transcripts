[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   Well, it's one of the most fundamental dynamics of our lives.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.560]   We are always becoming like what we most adore.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.360]   And yet when we look at ourselves, what we adore so often fluctuates in intensity all
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.600]   throughout the day.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.560]   And yet in Christ, we are progressing toward a maturity in Him as we worship Him.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.000]   John Piper explains how all of this dynamic works together from 2 Corinthians 3, verse
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.760]   18, in a recent sermon.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.720]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.320]   This is so variable, I'm tempted to say it's just incalculably variable, meaning the morning
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.360]   and the mid-morning and the noon and the afternoon and the night are all different.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.600]   Your heart for God is different at 10 and noon and 4 and 8.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.920]   It's different.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.600]   Your emotions are just like this.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.480]   Nobody lives like this.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.520]   Nobody.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.120]   And from week to week and month to month and year to year, and saints are allowed to move
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.560]   into seasons of great darkness, nights of the soul.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.480]   Here's what that verse says, 2 Corinthians 3, verse 18, "We all with unveiled face, beholding
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.960]   the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.960]   to another."
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.480]   Now notice, beholding the glory of the Lord is a present tense, ongoing action, not a
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.960]   one time action, ongoing, and so is being transformed.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.760]   Ongoing, not one time.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.720]   So let me read it again with that in mind.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.840]   We all with unveiled face, you have to read the context to see why he says that.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.200]   There was a veil lying over Israel and a veil is being lifted for us now to behold the Lord.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.760]   The veil is lifted, that's like God taking away the blinders.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:02.280]   The veil is lifted and we are beholding daily, weekly, Sunday by Sunday in preaching, day
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.360]   by day in reading our Bibles, we are beholding the glory of the Lord and are thus being transformed
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.240]   from one degree of glory to the other.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.760]   You become most like what you admire most.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.160]   That's what this is saying.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.880]   You become most like, progressively, what you admire most.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.160]   If you admire the glory of God most and all His ways, you will become more and more conformed
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.160]   to that.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.080]   That's what it says.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.400]   Beholding the glory of the Lord, we are being transformed into the same image from one degree
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.800]   of glory to another.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   Degree, degree.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.280]   Which is so encouraging because none of us has arrived.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.880]   So there's the cross, once for all, to pay for my truth suppressing God exchanging unrighteousness.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.600]   There's new birth, once for all, you don't get born again.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.120]   The heart of stone is taken out, the blindness is removed, the spirit is put within, God
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.680]   is restored as my treasure and then the rest of my life beholding the glory of the Lord,
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.720]   I am being changed from one degree of glory to the next.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.880]   So week by week in preaching, day by day in reading your Bibles, conferences like this,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.360]   I'm praying that right now this is happening, we are being changed from one degree of glory
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.360]   to another.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.740]   This is one of the most important dynamics of the Christian life and this clip comes
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.160]   from a message given last summer in a series titled "Living in the Light with Money, Sex,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.160]   and Power."
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.080]   It's a three-part series, three messages and one Q&A, all available at DesiringGod.org.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.720]   And if you want more from Piper on how 2 Corinthians 3:18 works, be sure to check out his new book,
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.620]   A Peculiar Glory, how the Christian scriptures reveal their complete truthfulness.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.820]   He talks about that passage several times in that book.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.780]   You can download the entire book free of charge at DesiringGod.org/books.
