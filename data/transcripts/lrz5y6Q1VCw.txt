[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.160]   Hi, Cal.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.840]   This is Suzanne.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.840]   I'm interested in your ideas about the autopilot schedule.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.000]   I've used an autopilot because I think
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.840]   it's important or maybe foundational to an ordered day
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.880]   and week.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.500]   But I'm more like Persephone, caught
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.880]   in the underworld of chaotic routines
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.960]   that sometimes are fit in and sometimes aren't.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.280]   Please tell me how you hack out time for regularly occurring
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.480]   obligations and how you fit them into a set part of your day.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.120]   Maybe it'll create a way for me to find Demeter,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.360]   the archetypal grounded mother, and get back
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.960]   into the late summer light of sanity.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.840]   Well, I will say, like Orpheus, I
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.080]   will venture down into Hades underworld
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.360]   in search of my own productivity uridities.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.120]   There we go.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.600]   Good Greek references.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.960]   I actually just recently went to see Hades Town
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.880]   at the Kennedy Center.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.800]   So I particularly appreciate those specific references.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.360]   So way to go.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.640]   For those who are uninitiated, autopilot schedule
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.840]   is actually an idea from pretty early study hacks days,
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.760]   back from when my newsletter was just a blog.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.680]   By the way, PSA, calnewport.com, you
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.040]   should sign up for my newsletter.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.400]   If you don't, you'll get my weekly essay
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.520]   that I've been writing there on topics like autopilot schedule
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.760]   since 2007.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.560]   The basic idea on the autopilot schedule
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.080]   is you find things that are regularly occurring,
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.840]   and you find set times and days to do them.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.180]   And so it's on your calendar, just repeated,
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.980]   and you don't even have to think about it.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.920]   When you get to those times, you just do it.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.880]   The more regularly occurring work that you can autopilot,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.520]   the less mental energy you have to generate,
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.800]   and the lower the chances that you fall into a scheduling
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.320]   roadblock where you spent too much time or this or that,
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.800]   and you get to the end of the week
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.960]   and realize you never got that done, or this is important,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.120]   and you don't have any more time to do it.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.700]   So you're much more consistently going
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.400]   to make progress on the things that matter
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.120]   if you're autopiloting them.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.080]   And you're just going to use a lot less energy
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.880]   because you're not trying to answer the question again
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.540]   and again, what should I do next?
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.380]   What should I do next?
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.300]   That is a draining thing to do,
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.560]   and you're not going to have optimal answers
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.940]   to that question a lot of the time
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.940]   if you have to keep asking it.
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.020]   So the balancing act you're talking about is a key one.
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.100]   If you over autopilot, so you make too many things
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.380]   recurring always at this time, always at this place,
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.540]   you have no give, you have no give
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.380]   for the unexpected that pops up,
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.760]   and then you're going to be frustrated.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.600]   You're going to be frustrated
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.140]   as you violate the autopilot schedule
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.620]   and now have to scramble to find time for it.
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.400]   This is just a balancing act.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.660]   There is no set answer.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.500]   It depends on the type of things we're talking about
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.740]   and what your schedule is like.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.380]   I introduced this idea originally in the context,
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.820]   for example, of college students.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.660]   College students can autopilot the hell out of their work.
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.100]   I mean, here's your classes, these are the assignments,
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.360]   you have this club or this sport that practices
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.620]   at this time or meets at this time,
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.060]   you know what your day is like, that's it.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.280]   You don't have a kid who's going to come home
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.980]   sick from school.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.140]   You're not going to have to go to the proctologist office
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.900]   to deal with whatever, I don't know what they deal with,
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.220]   I was going to say kidney stones,
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.260]   but that'd be a nephrologist or what have you, right?
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.740]   The type of stuff adults have to care about.
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.940]   You can autopilot the hell out of it.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.140]   And I tell students to do that.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.700]   I'm like, every single class, what are the assignments?
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.580]   When are you going to do them?
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.180]   Do it the same time, same days, every week.
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.260]   And I used to call this also the student workday.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.460]   You don't even have to basically think about productivity
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.180]   if you're a college student, if you do it right.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.460]   It's Tuesday at 12, I go to this library, do my lab report.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.220]   You don't even have to think about it.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.060]   For an adult with all sorts of adult things going on,
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.900]   with a job that's way less predictable than being a student
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.100]   where you just have to go to these classes
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.880]   and do these assignments, okay, you're not as flexible.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.120]   So it's a balancing act.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.040]   I like to autopilot, I don't know, 25% of my time.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.180]   Maybe that's a win.
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.660]   I mean, right now I'm really reflecting
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.100]   on my own schedule right now, if that's useful.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.660]   I autopilot a lot of the things
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.340]   if I'm really being reflective about it
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.840]   surrounding my classes, 'cause that's very regular.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.640]   When are problem sets going to get written?
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.580]   When are course lectures going to be prepped?
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.100]   When am I going to meet with my TAs about grading?
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.140]   When am I going to meet with students who have questions?
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.700]   I autopilot all of that because that's very predictable
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.220]   in a way that other things
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.940]   I might not be able to autopilot as easily,
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.020]   like work on a committee
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.060]   where it could be very unpredictable what's going to come up
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.660]   or when we're going to need to do a lot of effort.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.620]   I also autopilot my writing.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.540]   In particular, this fall,
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.460]   when I'm doing this twice a month column for the New Yorker,
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.020]   I'm pretty structured about these are the days and times
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.540]   in which I do that writing.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.020]   It doesn't always work because sometimes I get stuck
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.560]   or something's harder than I think,
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.700]   but it's a backbone to when the writing gets done
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.700]   so I don't have to think about it
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.320]   and it's really reduced the stress on it.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.340]   So good question.
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.780]   There's no set answer.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.440]   It's a balancing act.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.300]   Autopilot the things that seem amenable to it,
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.980]   but give yourself a lot of leeway
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.740]   because if you're a grownup with a grownup job,
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.340]   there's only so much that's going to be predictable.
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.920]   (upbeat music)
