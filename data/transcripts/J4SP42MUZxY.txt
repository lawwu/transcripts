[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.780]   Well, the Bible calls Christians to make peace, to be peacemakers.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.540]   It means that we are called to the very uncomfortable ministry of entering ourselves into the conflicts
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.260]   of others.
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.860]   So when do we enter into a situation?
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.580]   That's the question from a listener named Ryan.
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.580]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.380]   I just want to thank you so much for this podcast.
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.020]   It and many of the resources at DesiringGod.org have become a very important part of my Christian
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.020]   growth.
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.980]   My question for you is when, if ever, should we intervene in the divisions between two
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.320]   people in our local church?
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.580]   If we see two Christians who do not appear to be seeking a better relationship and only
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.960]   continue to distance themselves from each other, is there a point that it becomes necessary
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.820]   for other Christians to intervene?
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.820]   And at what point?
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.400]   I've been praying about the two individuals I'm thinking of, but are there any further
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.700]   actions laid out in the Bible?
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.780]   How have you done this yourself?
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.820]   I was talking to a friend just last night about how good it is when our adult children
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.380]   come home with their families for Thanksgiving or Christmas or just to visit, and we were
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.660]   observing that sometimes there are tensions or differences that have come between us and
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:27.460]   our kids, and we have to let those adult children be their own people and be glad if they're
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.720]   just willing to come home and be with us and be civil and gracious.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.100]   And he said, my friend that I was talking to said, that he knew one family that for
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.140]   generations seemed to handle all their disagreements and frustrations by long periods of silence
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.460]   and ostracism and estrangement.
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.820]   In other words, instead of finding some way to get along in spite of past hurts and present
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.340]   frustrations or political or religious differences, instead, they just didn't talk to each other
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.380]   for decades.
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.700]   One father would exclude a child from any communication for years, and a sister wouldn't
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.580]   talk to a brother for years, and a father wouldn't let the family go to a mother-in-law
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.500]   to their house for years.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.540]   And he observed that this was simply the way they had learned to deal with conflict.
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.260]   And so it went on from generation to generation.
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.460]   Now, the reason I begin with that anecdote is simply to illustrate that we probably should
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:40.700]   take into account when trying to help someone be reconciled to another, lots of different
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:49.380]   factors that may make it harder for them to get reconciled than it may seem to us.
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:58.220]   And we should be ready to have significant, deeper, extended conversations that may be
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.740]   difficult about the causes of the alienation than may appear on the surface.
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.460]   There's a passage in 1 Thessalonians 5.14 that shaped the way I have thought pastorally
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.140]   about such situations.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:22.060]   It goes like this, "We urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the faint-hearted,
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.180]   help the weak, be patient with them all."
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.660]   Now what's striking to me in that verse is that Paul does not say, "Do what you have
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.580]   to do with church discipline so that there aren't any more idlers and faint-hearted and
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.020]   weak people in this church, but only productive people and lion-hearted people and strong
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.020]   people."
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.780]   In other words, the way Paul's exhortation is given inclines me to think they're always
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.860]   going to be there.
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.760]   They're always going to be weak people and faint-hearted people and idle people who struggle
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.180]   with all kinds of stuff, and he's warning us, I think, against thinking perfectionistically
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.780]   about an all-or-nothing solution.
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.300]   So let me try to answer the question directly.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.340]   Here's what the question was.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.000]   My question for you is, "When, if ever, should we intervene in the divisions between two
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   people in our church?"
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.220]   And my answer is, we should intervene, and when and how we intervene is dependent on
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.780]   things like, how serious is the division?
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.980]   Two, how long has it been going on?
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.380]   Three, how mature are the people involved?
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.380]   Four, how close is your relationship with them?
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.580]   Five, who else is involved?
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.580]   And so on.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.740]   In other words, great wisdom is required for strategies of ministry to other people.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:55.340]   But the reason I say, yes, we should intervene is because of texts in the Bible like these,
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.780]   and I'll mention three.
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:04.960]   Galatians 6.1, "Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression," like being unforgiving
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.620]   toward a friend or something like that, "you who are spiritual, restore him in a spirit
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.620]   of gentleness.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.500]   Keep watch over yourself, lest you too be tempted."
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.340]   Or James 5.19, "Brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.420]   him back, let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.020]   his soul from death and cover a multitude of sins."
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.700]   Or Matthew 6.14, Jesus says, "If you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.700]   will forgive you.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.200]   But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.060]   you your trespasses."
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:51.080]   So it seems to me pretty clear that in Christ we are indeed our brother's keeper.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.040]   Our goal is not merely to save ourselves, but to save others as well.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.160]   Not merely to walk in the light, but help others walk in the light as well.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.720]   That's the way love thinks.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.000]   That's the way love acts.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.320]   And you can see from the passage in James and the passage in Matthew that what's at
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.600]   stake in some of these relationships is our very salvation.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.360]   I remember being in a small group when I was in seminary with a young woman who said, blew
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.480]   me away, she said, "I'll never forgive my mother for what she did."
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.920]   And we're Christians, we're Christians in this group.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.360]   And I looked at her kind of baffled, and I quoted to her this text from Matthew 6 that
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.960]   if you don't forgive, you won't be forgiven.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.280]   And she was very indignant that I would use that text in her case.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.160]   But that's how serious it seemed to me.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.480]   I think that's how serious it is.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:54.320]   So not to step in if somebody is holding a grudge in a way that Jesus said will destroy
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.960]   you, would be a kind of unloving timidity.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:07.000]   So closing exhortation, pray earnestly for wisdom, search the Scriptures, don't become
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.240]   a gossip about these other people, talking about them for a long time before you actually
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.360]   speak to them.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.160]   Develop a relationship of trust with them if you can, and then approach the issue with
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:29.240]   questions in an attempt to learn about what's going on before you instruct.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:37.360]   It will help you to know how to give guidance if you know the facts and if you discern the
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.200]   true state of their hearts.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.640]   Yeah, such an incredibly important ministry.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.960]   May we have the wisdom and the boldness to do this well.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.960]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.880]   Well are we given to too little introspection or to too much introspection?
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:29.200]   How do we find the right balance between self-examination neglected and over-self-examination made toxic?
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.880]   It's really a question I've wanted to Ask Pastor John a long time.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.200]   We're finally going to get to it on Wednesday when we return.
