[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   even without having someone come out, a few places that make homes less airtight that you can focus
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.400]   on yourself? It's windows, doors, and your attic. Because oftentimes you'll find that there's not
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.160]   enough insulation in your attic. And so it's like you can have somebody come in just if it's blown
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.040]   in insulation, it's really easy to do that. And it doesn't cost that much money. But windows and
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.800]   doors are like the biggest one. Check the air seals on the bottom of your door. A good friend
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.720]   of mine who's out in California, he moved into a new house, he sent me a picture of what it looked
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.680]   like under his door, and he had a gap that was like easily an inch from the bottom of the door
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.080]   to the floor. And it was just sunlight just coming in. If you have gaps like that, just go to some
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.760]   like local store and just get some new gaskets that you can put on the bottom of your door,
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.840]   seals around it, and you'll be surprised how much of a difference that can make.
