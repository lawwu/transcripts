[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.720]   show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.800]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm so excited you're here today
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.480]   for another return guest appearance
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.100]   from none other than my good friend, Ramit Sethi.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.280]   He's the author of "I Will Teach You To Be Rich,"
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.440]   a bestseller that sold over a million copies worldwide.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.240]   I'm a little partial to the second edition,
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.320]   which happens to feature me
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.040]   and my thoughts on credit cards on page 37.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.920]   He's also the host of the "I Will Teach You To Be Rich"
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.480]   podcast, where he goes behind the scenes with couples
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.940]   who share all the intimate details of their finances
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.680]   to get his advice, and his Netflix show,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.360]   "How To Get Rich," just dropped yesterday,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.680]   which I am excited to binge this week.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.520]   Now, if you're not familiar with Ramit's work,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.120]   you may think all those titles feel a bit used car salesy,
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.320]   but that assumption is definitely not true.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.160]   In all of his work, Ramit focuses on helping others
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.920]   define a unique version of their own rich life
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.160]   and make the best financial decisions they can
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.600]   to start living it.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.560]   Back in episode nine, we talked a ton
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.840]   about how to start living your own rich life,
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.240]   so definitely go check that out if you haven't.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.900]   But since then, he's worked with over 100 couples
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.080]   to talk about money,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.320]   so I wanted to dive deeper on that topic.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320]   That means best practices for managing money
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.560]   with your partner, building a shared rich life vision,
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.880]   moving from asking each other $3 questions
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.600]   to $30,000 questions, the red and green flags
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.120]   you might wanna look out for in your own relationship,
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.840]   and a lot more, so let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.080]   - Ramit, thanks for being here.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.440]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.800]   - Congratulations, Netflix shows out, how do you feel?
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.180]   - It feels surreal.
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.200]   I still cannot believe that I can turn on the TV
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.320]   and see myself, and I remember filming
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.320]   every one of those scenes, but when I watch the scenes,
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.300]   I know the setting, I know the street,
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.560]   I know what's gonna happen, and then I see my dumb face
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.000]   walking across the screen in this beautiful cinematic part
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.540]   of How to Get Rich, and I go, what's that guy doing there?
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.400]   So it still feels surreal, but it is amazing
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.020]   that so many people now are watching the show.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.840]   I'm excited to dig into it, but let's jump in first
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.600]   to some of what you've been learning talking to people,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.920]   which I know you started writing,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.480]   and it's not a two-way medium as much
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.520]   as you've been experienced now.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.360]   So with all the conversations you've had
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.100]   with people about money, and specifically
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.560]   with lots of couples, what do you think
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.820]   one of the biggest misconceptions people have
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.160]   when it comes to managing money with your partner?
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.920]   - Well, I think the biggest mistake that I see
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.920]   with couples is a lack of a shared vision,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.360]   and the way that it manifests is not two people
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.760]   coming to me and saying, hey, we have a lack
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.800]   of a shared vision, nobody ever says that.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.640]   You know what they say?
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.800]   They go, why does she spend so much at Target?
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.080]   Or why doesn't he ever wanna talk about money?
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.480]   That's how it comes up, so it's really transactional.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.980]   It's almost focused on these little jabs
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.640]   about what the other person is doing wrong,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.920]   and they come to me often, and they'll be like,
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.580]   I think I know the solution.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.420]   I go, what is it?
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.000]   They go, we need a budget.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.240]   I go, oh, really?
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.240]   Have you ever kept a budget?
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.760]   They go, yeah, in 2007, I kept a budget.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.840]   I go, how long did that last?
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.200]   Three weeks.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.660]   I go, you're crying, your partner's looking away,
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.320]   none of you wanna talk to each other,
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.220]   and you really think a tactical budget is the solution?
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.860]   No, and that's where the conversation really starts.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.220]   - And where do you go from there?
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.380]   You're seeing these jabs.
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.900]   Is it about solving the jabs?
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.260]   Is it about digging deeper?
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.220]   How would someone listening to this apply this
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.020]   if they're like, well, we're not on the same page?
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.760]   - I always start by asking, tell me about a time
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.620]   in the last month or two where you were not
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.260]   on the same financial page, and I do that very intentionally
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.980]   because it's very easy for couples
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.500]   to start speaking in platitudes.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.180]   He always does this, she always says that,
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.420]   and actually, those are really just stories
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.820]   that we tell ourselves.
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.940]   We create stories about each other.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.820]   He's considerate, she's busy, and that's maybe true.
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.100]   It may be situationally true,
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.980]   but what I really wanna do is take a specific instance.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.140]   We went out, we celebrated our son's birthday party,
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.380]   and then we got in a big fight on the car ride home.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.100]   I go, what happened?
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.060]   And I really make them walk me through it like a movie.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.980]   I wanna know scene by scene what's happening.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.140]   As they say it, you can hear people replay
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.740]   their version of reality, and there's a famous study
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.200]   that I remember studying in social psychology.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.160]   I think it was a Harvard-Yale football game,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.220]   or Harvard-Princeton or something.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.160]   Two schools that are not very good at football,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.180]   let me put it that way, and the crowds from each side
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.140]   were asked what happened in this football game,
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.260]   and both of them had radically different opinions
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.500]   about the referees and the integrity of the players,
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.620]   and that's exactly what happens with these couples.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.660]   So we start there, and then from there,
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.380]   we expand the conversation.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.220]   - In over, I think, almost 100 conversations
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.820]   you probably had, if not more, what's changed?
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.260]   Have you evolved your thinking of how to have
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.340]   these conversations, or what people should do,
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.340]   or how people should act?
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.740]   - Yeah, I mean, you can hear it.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.080]   I actually lost my temper in episode one, and I regret it.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.940]   There was a person on there who was saying some things
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.540]   that I really did not agree with,
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.740]   and I actually lost my temper,
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.900]   and I apologized in the episode because that's not cool.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.620]   I've become a lot calmer because I've seen so much.
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.940]   So that's number one.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.620]   Two, I can read things that are beneath the surface.
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.180]   You ever listen to "Love Line" back in the day
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.860]   with Adam Carolla and Dr. Drew?
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.820]   So they would get a caller, and within five seconds,
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.620]   they could identify certain things about that caller
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.220]   just by the tone of the person's voice,
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.220]   and it seemed like magic, but now I can understand it.
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.660]   So for example, there are little verbal
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.660]   and behavioral tells that we all have
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.100]   that tell us a lot about money.
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.780]   If somebody's using a debit card,
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.800]   they probably have credit card debt.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.820]   Okay, they may not even realize why,
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.160]   but they have credit card debt 'cause intuitively,
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.340]   they don't wanna put more money
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.240]   on the back of their balance.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.380]   If somebody says something like, "I grew up poor.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.820]   "I'm not afraid to be poor," again,
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.600]   that tells you a lot about the socioeconomic way
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   they grew up and how they view money.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.620]   So there's class, there's gender,
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.980]   there's a lot of different things that come to play,
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.780]   and you can hear the patterns
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.520]   after listening to a few episodes.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.740]   Once you start to realize people aren't on the same page
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.060]   about certain things and that you've play-by-played,
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.620]   kind of walk through this,
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.940]   what's the process for healing, if you will?
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.260]   How should people get on the same page?
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.660]   What are your kind of protocol or recommendations
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.860]   for how couples should operate around money
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.540]   for a healthy relationship?
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.620]   I like the way you describe it,
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.720]   a healthy relationship with money.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.900]   A lot of us think about a healthy relationship with food
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.660]   or a healthy relationship with our partner or our kids,
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.580]   but we don't usually think
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.960]   about a healthy relationship with money.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.500]   We just think of money as this thing
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.380]   that's always been, for example, guilt-inducing
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.740]   or anxiety-inducing, and we don't realize
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.620]   that there's actually another way to live.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.540]   So sometimes it's just asking people,
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.960]   what would it look like to feel good about money?
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.040]   They never thought of that.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.880]   They never even realized
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.100]   that they were feeling bad consistently,
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.060]   and so for them to even think about feeling good
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.100]   is totally foreign, but they could do it.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.620]   Intuitively, all of us know what it would feel like.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.420]   They start by saying what they wouldn't do.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.540]   Well, I wouldn't worry.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.740]   I wouldn't agonize over buying a pack of gum.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.500]   I go, okay, now tell me what you would do,
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.540]   'cause people love to identify themselves
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.940]   by what they wouldn't do or what they don't like.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.420]   I go, what would you do in your rich life?
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.700]   They go, well, I wouldn't worry
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.780]   about shopping at this place.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.340]   I go, okay, now tell me what you would do,
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.260]   and that is much harder.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.880]   So part of the premise is to help people start to rewrite
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.300]   the next chapter of their life.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.720]   Oftentimes, the same money beliefs we grew up with,
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.740]   I call them invisible scripts,
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.260]   are the ones we carry into our 20s, 30s, even 40s.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.900]   Things like our parents saying we can't afford it.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.200]   You hear that 1,000 times growing up.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.940]   You start to really believe it.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.500]   It's axiomatic, and one day, let's say you have a good job.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.420]   You're making 120K a year, and you have money in the bank,
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.420]   and then you realize,
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.560]   why am I agonizing over the price of broccoli?
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.260]   And it's not, quote, rational, but it's real to you.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.700]   So I wanna help them rewrite their narrative
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.740]   and rewrite the next chapter of their lives.
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.780]   - And how do you rewrite that?
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.220]   'Cause I imagine people listening,
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.320]   I know I'm one of them, have had that same problem.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.020]   And sometimes it's not, I can't afford this.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.140]   From listening to your show, which I've done quite a bit of,
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.660]   you know, blueberries seem to come up a lot.
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.440]   Rich people are obsessed with berries.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.060]   By the way, I am obsessed with berries too,
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.820]   'cause when I was a kid, we rarely got 'em.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.240]   They were super expensive, and so when I got 'em,
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.980]   it was like, oh my God, eat 'em fast.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.260]   And if I dropped one in the sink while I was cleaning 'em,
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.440]   I would feel anguish.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.260]   And now I have to tell you,
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.540]   to be able to get blueberries or raspberries
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.420]   and put 'em in my hand and wash 'em and eat 'em
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.380]   without counting how many there are,
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.060]   feels incredibly rich to me.
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.620]   That just shows you how emotional money is.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.380]   I could buy all the raspberries I want.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.260]   It's like a jewel.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.940]   Oh my God, look at this beautiful raspberry.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.780]   I get to eat this thing.
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.900]   It's a great example of how money emotions carry with us.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.860]   - Let's say you're at a place,
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.460]   you know that oftentimes you can get a nice pint
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.060]   of blueberries for 3.99 and they're 9.99.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.260]   It might not be that I don't feel
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.700]   like I can afford blueberries.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.780]   It might be that I just feel like this is not a good deal.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.260]   Well, I think a lot of your listeners are like this, right?
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.420]   They love the deal.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.540]   They love the hack.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.340]   And I'm all for that.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.060]   Like there's a time and a place
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.140]   where that makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.580]   In your 20s, certainly you have more time
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.860]   than money for most people.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:37.700]   And you're like, okay,
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.180]   I wanna find like the best airfare deal.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.020]   Love it.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.840]   Totally get it.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.680]   I did the same thing.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.520]   I get it.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.980]   But at a certain point,
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.300]   there's a phrase from an old self-development book,
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.580]   which is, "As I got wealthier,
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.180]   I couldn't afford to do certain things."
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.260]   Now, think about what that means.
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.820]   This person was referring to mowing the lawn,
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.460]   you know, for spending half of their Saturday
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.420]   mowing the lawn.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.620]   As they became wealthier,
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.900]   they couldn't afford it because
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.420]   they wanted to prioritize time with their son.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.780]   And so for me, I can't afford now,
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.980]   or I choose not to spend my time booking flights
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.340]   and trying to get the best deal.
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.060]   For me, the best point system
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.320]   is to be able to afford the flight that I wanna take.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.780]   That's really hard.
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.020]   That's really hard because a lifetime of optimizing,
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.260]   it feels like a win, right?
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.580]   You're like, "I got one over the bank.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.580]   I got one over the airline."
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.980]   But you may be winning the battle and losing the war.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.380]   And that war really is, "What is my rich life?"
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.660]   If you were to articulate,
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.420]   "What's your perfect week look like?"
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.980]   I bet you spending six hours saving $110
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.540]   on a flight to New York probably is not part of it.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.180]   But it sounds like if you can identify,
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.420]   I know you kind of have phrased this
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.820]   in like $3 questions and $30,000 questions.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.100]   It's not that I shouldn't spend the optimization energy
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.340]   on a Saturday afternoon.
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.300]   It's that there's probably a place in my life
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.680]   where I could spend it
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.100]   that isn't gonna save me $3 in blueberries,
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.940]   but might add 20% to my business this year,
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.060]   or might be spent evaluating other opportunities
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.020]   for a career that could double my income.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.740]   I would say it's not stop optimizing.
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.380]   Would you say it's more about figuring out
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.840]   where the optimization can have the most impact?
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.900]   I think it's about elevating yourself
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.580]   to the level that you are at.
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.740]   When you need to save 50 bucks at the age of 22,
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.780]   it makes perfect sense.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.740]   The problem is that most of us get stuck there.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.220]   And we don't realize that as your wealth increases,
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.140]   your psychology needs to correspondingly come along.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.860]   So wealth, by the way, could increase
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.860]   by your income going up, your investments going up.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.460]   Your time may simply shrink
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.020]   because you have a family or a busy career or a sick parent.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.660]   And so you can't keep operating
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.880]   at the same level with everything.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.400]   Now, if it's your hobby, and you're like,
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.180]   I actually love to do flight hacking, great.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.140]   But don't deceive yourself and say like,
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.180]   I'm doing this to save money.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.320]   What we need to do is really adjust our view on the world.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.380]   That's the crux of these $3 questions
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.760]   versus $30,000 questions.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.220]   We agonize over $3 questions like,
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.980]   should I buy the extra large coffee?
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.180]   Should I get the cheesecake?
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.980]   Should I flight hack this thing?
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.540]   Versus if you have a business,
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.840]   a $30,000 question or even $300,000 question
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.540]   is much better time spent.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.860]   - I'll push back on the flight thing
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.820]   because I think you could probably optimize away
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.320]   your family vacation for the year,
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.720]   which might be five, $10,000,
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.740]   which for a lot of people might be a huge impact.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.560]   - I agree.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.280]   - But I think I just have to get over.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.620]   It's not worth trying to find the cheaper berries
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.560]   or not get them, but it's so hard.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.400]   - Let's do this.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.600]   So I never find success in telling people to get over it.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.820]   It never works, right?
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.380]   Like, hey, get over this emotion
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.380]   you've felt for the last 35 years.
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.980]   It's stupid, that doesn't work.
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.980]   So instead, what I really do,
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.380]   especially in around the first half
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.620]   of my conversations with people,
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.020]   is I really go deep on where'd that come from?
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.980]   What does it feel like to you
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:03.380]   when you get the $75 savings on a JetBlue flight?
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.300]   And how does it reflect on your partner?
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.140]   What does your partner say?
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.500]   And they're over there rolling their eyes.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.320]   You can see them on the YouTube video.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.340]   And I go, okay, like, that's cool.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.300]   I'm not judging them.
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.040]   I'm really trying to get them to express
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.880]   because most of them have never been asked about it.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.920]   And they've pretty much been mocked
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.880]   by their partner, et cetera.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.240]   So I'm just like, tell me more.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.680]   Where does it come from?
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.920]   And then we start to examine what is their rich life?
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.600]   And if their rich life is, I wanna go to Bora
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.040]   or I want to be able to stay home with my kids
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.920]   for a few years while they're young, I go, cool.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.760]   I love that vision.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.580]   That's beautiful.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.420]   Tell me more about that.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.240]   And then we start to try to bring the things together.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.980]   Is this thing you're doing serving your vision today
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.300]   or is it not?
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.260]   And a lot of times you find out that the vision
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.940]   and what they're doing on a day-to-day basis
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.340]   is totally misaligned.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.080]   Like I had somebody who drives miles to save money on gas
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.680]   and it's just not serving them anymore.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.800]   It's not even part of their vision.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.820]   And again, this goes back to the lack of a shared vision.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.640]   Most of us don't have an individual vision
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.660]   of what our rich life is.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.220]   We just like, we're really vague about it.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.540]   I like to travel.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.980]   And we certainly do not have a shared vision
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.280]   that is vivid and specific.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.160]   How would you tell someone that's listening saying,
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.000]   okay, I want this.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.360]   I want an individual and a shared vision.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.280]   What are the steps to create that vision?
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.360]   What does it actually look like?
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.240]   Is it written down?
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.360]   Is it an idea?
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.400]   Yeah, it's written down.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.960]   People intuitively know what they love.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.620]   So I do a quick little exercise.
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:27.520]   We can do it right now.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.360]   Money dials.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.180]   Let's talk about it.
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.120]   So what, Chris, is the thing that you love
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.020]   to spend money on?
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.160]   Very few things, but I do like food.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.120]   Food, okay, great.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.500]   And what do you love about it?
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.520]   I think especially right now in a world with young kids
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.240]   where travel isn't what it used to be.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.480]   I mean, at one point we quit our jobs
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.200]   and we just backpacked for eight months, right?
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.480]   Like this is just not an option with two small kids.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.120]   So I think going out and getting to eat
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.560]   at lots of different restaurants.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.120]   I get so excited when a new cuisine or a new place opens up.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.120]   It's like, I want to do that
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.600]   because we're getting a little bit
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.380]   of that cultural experience while we can't travel.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.000]   So that's something right now I feel like
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.200]   I'm willing to spend money on.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.040]   Okay, love it.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.160]   Another money dial, food.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.360]   By the way, that's the number one most common money dial
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.200]   is eating out.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.820]   So you're in great company.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.120]   Number one is eating out.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.280]   Number two is travel.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.640]   Three is health and wellness.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.000]   Four is convenience, which happens to be mine.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.780]   And then there's many other money dials.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.720]   Now, my second question,
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.880]   and the reason I call it a money dial,
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.560]   which you can turn up or turn down,
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.240]   is Chris, if you could quadruple
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.720]   the amount you spend on eating out,
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.120]   what would it look like and what would it feel like?
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.700]   Before you answer, everybody listening and watching,
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.600]   I want you to do this with us.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.280]   So remember, what is the thing you love to spend money on?
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.720]   And get as specific as Chris did.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.560]   He had a big smile when he was talking about,
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.960]   I get excited about the restaurant opening.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.800]   That's question one.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.760]   And now question two,
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.760]   what if you could quadruple your spend and turn that dial?
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.760]   Go ahead.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.920]   So I know the answer to this
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.980]   because it just seems so obvious.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.040]   Most people listening maybe at one point in their life
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   have done a cooking class.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.320]   If not, and you like food, I would encourage it.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.520]   And when you do that,
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.880]   you're not taking like a technical pastry making,
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.200]   but you're taking kind of more of a cultural experience
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.280]   maybe while you're traveling.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.480]   You're sitting down with someone from a country
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.920]   teaching you their food.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.000]   Because this is the experience I want out of cooking,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.920]   it would look like,
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.320]   instead of go out and spend money on an Indian restaurant,
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.560]   I'd love to hire an Indian cook or chef to come in
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.600]   and do an Indian cooking class and make a dinner.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.520]   Are you trying to hire my mom right now?
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.360]   If she's listening.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.980]   Hold on, I'm about to negotiate a deal right now.
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.000]   How much are you willing to pay for this?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.040]   Where is she based?
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.760]   She'll come to you, depends on the price though.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.600]   Yeah, I know.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.640]   She's got a son who represents her well.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.560]   Quadruple though.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.560]   She's got to do it for less than four times
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.400]   the local Indian restaurant.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.420]   I think we might have a business idea here.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.520]   But yeah, that's what that would look like,
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.080]   is every time, if we want to go have a Lebanese dinner,
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.380]   let's go have it with a family at a house,
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.220]   cook it at our house.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.040]   I don't care where,
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.040]   but more than just order from a menu at a restaurant.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:54.880]   I love that.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.840]   What a beautiful answer.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.720]   Okay, I'll tell you what I love about that answer.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.600]   First of all, you've clearly thought about it.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.520]   Okay, I love that.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.640]   That's actually quite rare.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.680]   When I ask people what would it look like to quadruple,
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.960]   usually they haven't thought about it.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.120]   And then their first initial answer is very linear.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.760]   They almost always, with food, say,
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.760]   "Well, I'd probably be eating out four times a week."
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.240]   Which is possible, you know.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.820]   But I love that you went multi-dimensional.
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.200]   It wasn't just quadruple the quantity,
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.760]   it was the changing the quality.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.000]   And you went to the experience.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.300]   I want to have the cultural experience.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.960]   I want to have a chef come in,
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.560]   or we'll go to them and teach us, create an experience.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.880]   There's so many different ways to think about
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.560]   expanding your vision of what you love.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.240]   And so if you're listening to this,
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.400]   food is a great example.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.800]   Chris just gave us a phenomenal way to think about
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.000]   what would it look like to turn that dial up.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.800]   If it's travel, you can imagine
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.560]   you might go to different destinations.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.080]   You might stay at different hotels,
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.200]   if you're a hotel person, or fly on a different seat.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.160]   You might bring loved ones with you and treat them.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.820]   There's so many different ways to expand your vision.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.800]   Now the whole point of this,
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.820]   why are we even talking about money dials,
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.400]   is that how can you create a vision
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.280]   for what excites you about your money,
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.080]   if you only think about money
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.640]   in terms of restriction and anxiety?
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.600]   And that's how most of us think about money.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.720]   I ask you, how do you feel about money?
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.000]   They go, I feel guilty, I feel overwhelmed, I feel stressed.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.280]   I go, okay, well, what do you talk about
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.160]   on a day-to-day basis?
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.540]   They go, can we afford Target?
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.320]   Why'd we spend so much on asparagus?
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.720]   How come my partner never reconciles this and that?
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.380]   I go, yeah, that sucks.
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.500]   All you talk about is negativity and reactivity.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.280]   We gotta be able to have a vision
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.000]   so that we can spend extravagantly on the things we love,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.600]   as long as we cut mercilessly on the things we don't.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.640]   So that, Chris, is how I start off,
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.560]   really help people create their vision,
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.040]   is to find out what they're already excited about,
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   and then ask them themselves to articulate
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.520]   what turning that dial up would look like.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.900]   - And do you also ask them
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.680]   what you would turn the dial down on, or?
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.360]   - Yeah, but not till way later.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.240]   Because I want them to get super excited.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.140]   So usually, a common example, everybody loves Italy.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.860]   It's like the safest destination.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.660]   - We just did an episode on Italy.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.100]   So much good feedback, go back and listen if you haven't.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.060]   - It's like a gimme.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.020]   It's like a comedian making a fart joke.
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.900]   You're like, okay, you kinda know
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.940]   you're gonna get that response.
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.620]   By the way, I'm not equating Italy to a fart joke.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.800]   But I am saying, whenever you talk about Italy,
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.860]   everyone's got a big smile.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.180]   Hell, we even took our parents
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.220]   as part of our honeymoon to Italy,
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.980]   because we know everybody loves it.
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.180]   People will go, I love to travel.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.540]   I go, where would you like to travel?
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.680]   And they just go like, oh, I'd just like to go anywhere.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.800]   I go, uh-uh, you're gonna tell me
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.000]   exactly where you wanna go.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.960]   I force them to get specific.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.800]   And so, we end up with them saying,
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.560]   I wanna drink Italian wine, watch the sunset in Rome,
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.880]   and be staying where we can see the Colosseum.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.880]   I go, now that is a beautiful vision.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.120]   That is really specific.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.440]   And my final question, who would you take with you?
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.440]   So suddenly, they've articulated,
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.680]   they can almost smell it, right?
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.960]   Now that they have that vision,
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.840]   I take a look at their numbers.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.100]   And everyone is required to submit
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.160]   all of their numbers to me.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.180]   So I can see their net worth, income, debt, everything.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.140]   And you can see it too.
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.140]   I pop it up on screen.
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.260]   Can you imagine being able to see a couple
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.180]   who overspends by $4,000 a month every month,
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.020]   and they didn't even know it?
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.340]   That happens on the pod.
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.540]   Or a couple who's got a net worth of like $6 million,
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:23.460]   and they agonize over an extra $100 a night for a hotel.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.920]   That also happens.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.420]   Once they know that they wanna go to Italy
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.660]   and see the sunset, it's actually much easier
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.380]   for them to themselves make decisions
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.100]   about what to cut back on.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.460]   And that's one of the cruxes of how to get people
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.260]   to change their behavior with money.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.020]   - Have you ever had to come up
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.500]   with a list of interview questions
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.100]   or summarize a long document,
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.740]   pulling out some action items,
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.900]   or even brainstorm ideas for an important project?
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.860]   In the past few weeks,
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.900]   I've actually done all three of those
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.100]   better and faster than I used to
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.940]   because I am quickly mastering how I use Notion AI
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.300]   to optimize my work,
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.180]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.500]   As you all know, I'm such a huge fan of Notion
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.660]   for saving notes, trip planning, managing our family,
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.180]   running this podcast, and so much more.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.460]   It was already an amazing tool,
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.660]   but the way I can automate things with Notion AI
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.640]   just makes it so much better.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.020]   For example, let's say you took a bunch of messy notes
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.780]   in a meeting or while reading a book
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.780]   and wanna turn them into something polished.
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.060]   You could do it in seconds with Notion AI.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.540]   Or maybe you just wanna take a long sales email you wrote
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.740]   and have Notion AI make it a little shorter
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.820]   and give it a more confident tone.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.600]   So if you wanna work faster, write better, and think bigger,
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.020]   doing tasks that normally take you hours in just seconds,
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.860]   try Notion AI for free

[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:04.540]   Looking to get your financial future organized?
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.580]   Well, if you don't have life insurance yet,
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.660]   that should be at the top of your list.
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.260]   Fabric by Gerber Life is the easy one-stop shop you need
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.100]   with life insurance and other family finance solutions
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.220]   all in one place.
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.940]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.100]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.320]   to help you get a high quality, surprisingly affordable
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.360]   term life insurance policy in less than 10 minutes.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.120]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.280]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.640]   and I found Fabric to be highly competitive
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.760]   with great policies, like a million dollars in coverage
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.600]   for less than a dollar a day.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   It takes less than 10 minutes to apply
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.600]   and you could be offered coverage instantly
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.520]   with no health exam required.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.480]   So protect your family today with Fabric by Gerber Life.

[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.780]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Insurance Company,
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.500]   not available in certain states,
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.340]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.900]   I'm fortunate 'cause I know my wife would say
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.860]   something similar about food,
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.420]   but let's say she didn't care about food
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.620]   and her money dial is clothing.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.520]   What happens then?
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.640]   We talked about building a vision and your money dials,
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.880]   but what if they don't align?
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.720]   Well, that's okay.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.640]   They don't all have to align.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.000]   That's actually a big relief that you and your partner
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.120]   do not have to see eye to eye on everything,
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.200]   but it does help to see eye to eye on a few big things.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.480]   So let me give you a few examples,
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.580]   including from my own life.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.400]   So I love really nice hotels.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.120]   My wife likes them, but she doesn't love them like me.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.720]   Okay, I love them.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.440]   And so we've discussed this a lot.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.420]   And we've come up with a solution that works well for us,
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.860]   which is when we travel, it's a special occasion,
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.140]   it's an anniversary, et cetera.
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.980]   So jointly, we're gonna stay at this beautiful place.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.780]   But sometimes we're going somewhere and she's like,
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.620]   "You know what?
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.380]   "I'm perfectly happy with the ordinary place."
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.220]   And I go, "Oh, but that city has this awesome resort.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.280]   "I wanna stay there."
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.940]   And so we've talked about how do we wanna reconcile that.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.220]   And in our case, we go,
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.980]   "I will pay the difference personally
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.860]   "because it's valuable to me."
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.620]   And for her, she doesn't really mind it at all,
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.500]   staying anywhere.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.620]   Other times, we go somewhere and we're like,
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.780]   "Hey, we don't actually need to stay at a fancy place.
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:21.640]   "We're perfectly fine.
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.940]   "We're gonna be in and out.
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.380]   "Cool, we'll stay at a more modest place.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.580]   "That's fine."
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.300]   But the key is we're talking about it.
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.480]   And we're acknowledging that we've got differences
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.060]   in certain areas and coming up with a solution for it.
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.900]   More often than not, couples are not,
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.900]   they don't even know what their money dial is.
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.380]   They don't know what they love and what they don't love.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.360]   And so everything becomes an existential question.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.800]   Why do you wanna stay at an on-property Disney hotel?
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.760]   I don't want to.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.720]   It's $1,200 more and it's purely transactional.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.120]   And if you have to go through life
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.360]   fighting about transaction after transaction,
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.300]   you've made a wrong turn way back there
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.160]   by not identifying the key things
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.360]   that are important to each of you.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.800]   - You mentioned that you could just use your money
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.200]   for the nice hotel.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.560]   Do you think it's helpful for couples
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.380]   to have some money that's their own
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.240]   and some money that's theirs together?
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.080]   What's your perspective?
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:10.900]   - 100%.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.540]   The simplest way to set up joint accounts
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.820]   is one joint account, which is used for all joint expenses.
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:22.060]   Rent or mortgage, utilities, cell phone, all that stuff.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.540]   It pays off your credit card.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.260]   It goes into joint savings, all of that.
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.820]   But I also recommend having a little bit of individual money
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.580]   that each of you can do whatever you want with.
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.100]   And I think that's really healthy.
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.900]   And a lot of people, they prefer to have
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.460]   a little bit squirreled away in their own personal savings.
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.140]   Fine, other people want to spend it on their hobby, fine.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.300]   In my case, it would be really nice hotels, also fine.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.180]   It's no questions asked money.
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.540]   You get to do whatever you want with it.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.820]   That is, in my opinion, a really healthy way
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.460]   to approach a hybrid system of joint and individual money.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.100]   - And is there a target for how much you kind of put
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.140]   of your earnings into that amount?
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.180]   Does what you make matter at all in this scenario?
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.580]   - I think it does, I think it does.
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.860]   Proportional is always a good way to think about
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:06.940]   how to set up your account.
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.660]   So if one person is making three times
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:09.900]   what the other person's making,
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.580]   it's fair to say that one approach,
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.500]   which I think is pretty healthy,
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.060]   is for them to pay more for joint.
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.580]   Now, how you negotiate,
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.420]   how much goes into your individual accounts is up to you.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.420]   But if a person is making three X more,
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.140]   it's likely they take a little bit more
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.300]   in their individual accounts as well.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.700]   Also keep in mind that the person who's earning less
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.260]   should not be totally burdened
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:35.220]   and be spending 90% of their money on rent
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.740]   because the higher earner wants to live in a nicer place.
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.820]   That's not fair either.
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.180]   - So the model we use is we have one shared checking account,
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.420]   all the income from everything goes in there
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.780]   and all the credit cards get paid.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.860]   We have our own credit cards
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.900]   and we kind of spend on them how we will,
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.300]   but we're not really keeping track of who's spending what.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.580]   And it works, is that okay?
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.300]   Are there problems we're missing
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.620]   of giving people a little more freedom
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.300]   because it's all commingled?
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.460]   - This is a great question.
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.700]   And you are one of the few people who says,
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.780]   "Hey, it's working for us,
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.820]   but what problems are we not seeing down the road?"
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.540]   That is an amazing question.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.340]   So overall, if it's working,
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.100]   I say generally that's fantastic.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.820]   What we wanna do with money and account setups
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.180]   is to make sure, as you pointed out,
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.700]   that we're not setting ourselves up
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.340]   for a big blow up down the road.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.700]   So here's some things to think about.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:27.140]   You had kids before, you may have said like,
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.980]   "Hey, we know how to spend, we're married,
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.300]   we don't have kids."
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.540]   And when you have kids, obviously things change a lot.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.820]   One person might say,
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.740]   "I wanna buy a really expensive stroller
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.060]   or this type of food, et cetera."
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.780]   And the other might not.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:42.620]   You can do two things.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.300]   One is you can change the way your accounts are set up.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.100]   Two, you can just have open, regular conversations.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.740]   I call them rich life reviews.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.180]   You do them once a month,
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.980]   or in certain times, once every two weeks,
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:54.900]   and you just realign.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.260]   You don't have to agree on everything, again,
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.140]   but you can find solutions to make it work.
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.020]   I do think that some things to keep in mind going forward
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.900]   would be big changes in income.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.820]   Like, let's just say you start making 4X what you're making.
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.460]   You might go, "Hey, I wanna step it up.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.620]   I wanna stay at this place,
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.860]   or I wanna fly this type of thing," or whatever.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.220]   And your wife might not.
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.300]   That's worth a discussion.
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.500]   But aside from that, if it's working
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.820]   and you have regular conversations, I say thumbs up.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.020]   - It's funny, I haven't thought about this.
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.140]   There's a book called "The 80-80 Marriage."
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.260]   - Yeah, we've talked about it before, yeah.
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.620]   - I interviewed Nate and Kaylee Klempp
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.380]   with my wife on episode, I think it was 43.
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.380]   I'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.660]   But one of the things that I'd never processed until now
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.500]   was whether you apply this concept,
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.060]   which is basically that instead of everyone
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.940]   kind of playing the tit-for-tat game
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.700]   of we each get $100, we can spend $100,
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.420]   if you could elevate to,
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.300]   we know no one's trying to overspend
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.180]   the amount of money that we have as a family.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.060]   We're trying to make sure that we have good times
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.100]   and we can do our own things,
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.220]   but you assume best intent, effectively,
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.140]   and you have healthy conversations,
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.340]   maybe that could be something that works.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.820]   - 100%, but remember,
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:09.020]   most couples don't have a vision together.
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.100]   So they go, yeah, of course, you know,
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.020]   I trust my partner, we have kids together, et cetera,
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.140]   but I just can't get over how
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.020]   they always spend so much on this.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.220]   Again, they attack the tactic, they attack the symptom.
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.980]   What I wanna encourage people to do
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.540]   and what I do on the Netflix show and on the podcast
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.460]   is to zoom up and say,
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.780]   what kind of life do we want to live together?
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.180]   Some people, their rich life is to be able
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.380]   to pick up their kids from school every afternoon.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.300]   Beautiful, I love it.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.540]   Okay, so what do we want to do with our money
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.380]   to ensure that?
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.180]   Because if you're spending too much on a mortgage
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.260]   or a truck, then the other partner
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.500]   might not be able to do that.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.540]   And so that is where we wanna start.
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.460]   What's the vision?
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.860]   What does our rich life look like?
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.100]   Down to what does our perfect day look like?
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.500]   And then let's use our money to try to create that.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.620]   - So obviously you need two people
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.700]   to create a shared vision.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.900]   Do you need two people to be the money manager
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.740]   in the household?
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.700]   Or do you think it's okay for one person
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.540]   to be like, I'm gonna manage all the investments
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.300]   and track the expenses and do the budgeting?
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.540]   Or is it helpful to have both people?
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.100]   - No, you cannot do it alone.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.300]   This is a really common thing.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.420]   People will say, oh, well, like,
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.060]   she's the money person in our relationship.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:20.740]   I go, red flag, because just like,
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.580]   you will almost never these days hear someone saying,
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.380]   oh, like, he's the parent in this family.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.500]   She's the parent.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.780]   That's not how it works.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.100]   Both people have to be involved.
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.500]   It is that foundational.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.700]   So unlike emptying the dishwasher
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.060]   or gardening in the back, watering the plants,
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.300]   which typically one person will do,
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.940]   it's just natural in a couple,
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.060]   money is much more like parenting.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.220]   We've both got to be involved.
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.780]   We've got to have a vision.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.020]   We've got to talk about it.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.540]   And we've both got to put some skin in the game.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.740]   That doesn't mean that both of you have to be sitting there
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.140]   tweaking your asset allocation.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.620]   First of all, you shouldn't even be doing that.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.460]   One of you is probably gonna be a little more knowledgeable
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.020]   and comfortable with investments.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.420]   Okay, in our relationship, that's me.
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.540]   But we still look at the numbers.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.420]   We talk about what it means.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.220]   And she knows.
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.380]   And when we got together, I told my wife,
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.500]   look, it would be really easy for me
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.740]   to be the money guy in our relationship, right?
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.740]   That's what I do for a living.
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:20.580]   I know how to do this.
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.380]   My systems are bulletproof.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:27.100]   But I told her, I want us to both do this.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.980]   And I insisted on it because one day
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.780]   I'm gonna get hit by a bus.
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.180]   And the worst thing I could do
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.620]   would be to leave her defenseless,
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.540]   especially against some 1.5% AUM
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.820]   bullshit charging advisory service.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.260]   I would come back, okay, from heaven or hell.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.860]   And I would be so pissed.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:44.900]   I told my wife that.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.740]   And she was like, I would never do 1.5% AUM.
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.820]   Ah, I love you, babe.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.300]   The other thing is, you need two sets of eyes on your money
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.860]   because these things get complicated, right?
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:54.700]   How should we spend?
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.540]   Am I doing it right?
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.660]   I just need someone to check me.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.660]   And third and most importantly, it's just more fun.
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.700]   Why would you wanna go on this journey alone?
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.780]   This is a rich life.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.180]   It's not about budgeting.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.380]   It's not about paying your bills on time.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.020]   That's a classic myth people have.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.220]   They think managing money means paying bills on time.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.100]   Wrong.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.700]   This is about creating a rich life.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.100]   And you wanna do it with your life partner.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.460]   It's just more fun.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.180]   - A lot of times I get emails from people saying,
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.300]   no, I really wanna get my spouse involved,
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.820]   but they're just not that interested.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:22.860]   - Yeah.
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.740]   - It sounds like one tactic is create this rich life together
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.540]   and excite people about money with what it can do.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.540]   Are there other things that you've seen work well
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.380]   to get people involved?
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.220]   - But wait, hold on, hold on.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.380]   Yes, but I don't wanna skip this
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.300]   because we can't just skip over like it's not fun.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.100]   Yeah, your partner's probably not involved
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.540]   'cause every time you both talk about money, it's a fight.
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.300]   And it's some meaningless tactical question.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.900]   Oh my God, I can't believe you got the expensive pickles.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.140]   Who the hell wants to talk about pickles
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:48.980]   for the rest of their life?
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.140]   I wouldn't even wanna have those conversations.
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.420]   So I would say to everybody listening,
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.220]   the last time you talked about money or the time before,
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.660]   was it a transactional question?
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.700]   Was it a negative question?
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.580]   Was it something accusatory or was it a dream?
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.460]   Hey, you know what, I've been thinking,
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.500]   what do you think would make this rest of this year
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.260]   amazing for us?
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.820]   Oh, we're planning to see our family for the holidays.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.340]   What if we took a day before
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.740]   and just did something for the two of us?
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.700]   Have you ever had that kind of conversation?
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.700]   You know, I talk about it all the time,
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.140]   but I've tried to model it.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.260]   That's why on the podcast and the show,
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.380]   you can actually hear me showing couples.
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.220]   You could see me showing them how to do that.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.060]   Look at the excitement right now.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.540]   That's the kind of energy I want people to bring to it.
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:35.540]   So yes, that's number one.
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.140]   And recalibrating your relationship always is hard.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.500]   Your partner might be like, this is really weird.
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.860]   Why are you talking like that?
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:41.700]   You go, you know why?
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.340]   Because I've realized that when we talk about money,
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.100]   it's not really fun and I want it to be fun.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.220]   I love you and I want us to create
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.500]   this amazing life together.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.180]   Will you sit down and do it with me?
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.340]   That's compelling.
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.820]   So that's number one.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.420]   Two is, I like people to save for something
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.260]   that they can do that's really fun this year.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.900]   It could be an overnight trip camping.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.420]   It could be an amazing trip to Thailand.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.980]   It could be a meal at a restaurant
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.100]   that you've both wanted to do.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.100]   But that's a really fun way to make the connection
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.220]   that spending money can be something
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.900]   that is part of your rich life.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.780]   Totally different than, oh God, we gotta pay this bill.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.780]   So I hope everybody's hearing over and over,
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.620]   start with the positive.
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.180]   Start with the vision.
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:27.300]   Start with using your money to live the rich life.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.020]   And all the restriction and cutting back and all that stuff,
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.580]   we could deal with that stuff later.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.660]   - But I do wanna talk about it
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.540]   because I'm imagining a conversation
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.540]   between a couple being, okay, what do we wanna do?
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.500]   You know what, it'd be really nice
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.700]   to go on a trip to Italy, let's say.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:40.780]   You know, everyone wants to go to Italy.
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.860]   And it'd be great if we could bring our family there
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.420]   with us so we could experience it with them.
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.300]   But it'd also be nice if we could be there
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.780]   for a few days on our own before.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.700]   Maybe we even have someone who could take care of the kids
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.220]   so we can really enjoy it.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:52.660]   It's like, but when it comes down to it,
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.740]   we still have to pay for that trip.
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:54.580]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:55.420]   - And we don't have the money
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.540]   to pay for that trip right now.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.620]   So how do you kind of get back to reality
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.300]   when you've designed a rich life that you want,
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.140]   but you just practically can't afford it right now?
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.540]   - Okay, I love your example.
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.460]   First of all, no one ever gets that specific
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.380]   in their example or that big.
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.180]   So like, yeah, Chris, you know, you're living the life
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.340]   and you're well-experienced with this.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.660]   But honestly, the way people react,
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.940]   they shrink their dreams.
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.180]   We've been taught to shrink.
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.220]   So I'll literally ask them, "What's your rich life?"
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.020]   And they'll go, "I always have dreamed
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.140]   "of having a beach house.
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.460]   "It's not like I need a big one.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.420]   "It can be a small one.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:28.380]   "It could be a shack.
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.620]   "It could be half flooded.
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:32.220]   "But you know, it would just be kind of nice."
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.620]   I go, "What the hell?
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.460]   "Why are you shrinking your dreams
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.900]   "in this hypothetical example?
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.260]   "The point is a rich life, not a small life."
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:43.060]   So what you just did naturally is actually a great example
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.460]   of what I wish people would do is that we are motivated
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.140]   by big dreams and by vivid examples,
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.020]   not by naturally shrinking our dreams
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.780]   to something that seems modest,
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:56.020]   but actually will not motivate us three days from now.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.700]   So that's number one.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.500]   Number two, it's natural that you come up
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.580]   with some things you wanna do that you can't afford now.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.380]   That is a good sign you're on the right track.
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.540]   A rich life is lived today and tomorrow.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.340]   So we did this exercise, my wife and I did it together.
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.740]   It's the 10-year bucket list exercise.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.020]   Love to share it with everybody right now.
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.820]   We sat down and we pulled out two pieces of paper.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.140]   And you can do this, it's really fun.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.780]   There's basically very few numbers involved.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.340]   And you go, "Hey, in the next 10 years,
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:29.340]   "what can we do that would make it an amazing, rich life?"
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.900]   And so you each take a few minutes and you write it down.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.640]   Some of them can be just for you.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.780]   Some of them can be together.
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.180]   And then we compared notes.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.500]   So we had some examples of learning
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.540]   a different language, et cetera.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.460]   Each of us go back and forth.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.340]   And this is where you get curious.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.780]   "Oh, wow, you wanna learn Spanish?
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.240]   "Would we do it in Mexico City?
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.080]   "Would you do it alone?
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.180]   "Oh, you wanna go skydiving?
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.980]   "That's for you, no thanks, I'm staying on the ground."
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.700]   And we identified one of our things that was big.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.940]   It was the equivalent of the Italy trip.
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.460]   And for us, it was a 10-year wedding anniversary abroad.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.780]   Well, we wanna save money for that.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.700]   So what we did was we did a back of the napkin calculation.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.420]   Let's just pretend it's gonna cost $10,000,
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.780]   just for easy math.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.660]   Okay, we know it's gonna be roughly 10 years from now.
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.540]   That means we need to save $1,000 per year.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.540]   Okay, great.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.060]   We now put that money automatically
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.860]   into a sub-savings account.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.180]   And we know for a fact exactly when we will have enough
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.700]   for that dream trip of ours.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:29.820]   That's how you do it.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.300]   - I mean, that assumes you had the $1,000
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.060]   a year to set aside, right?
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.820]   You talk about cutting costs mercilessly.
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.060]   Is the other aspect of this trying to go in
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.260]   and see where you're maybe not getting that much value?
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.340]   This is a conversation my wife and I had the other day.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.380]   We were walking in the neighborhood,
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:48.460]   and we were like, "Well, if we had $5,000 extra a year
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.300]   "to spend on something,
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.980]   "what would we be excited to spend it on?"
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.140]   - Great question.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.060]   - And then we said, if we look at what we had
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.820]   to cut out of our budget,
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:00.220]   are we getting as much joy out of the first $5,000 to go
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.020]   as we would from the next $5,000 to spend?
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:06.220]   And if not, then we should absolutely just cut that $5,000
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.220]   and swap it out.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.060]   - Okay.
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.060]   - And then we threw savings as a third option.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.060]   It's like, we have $5,000.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.060]   We could save it, we could spend it,
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.620]   or we could spend it more optimally.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.220]   - And did this get you anywhere?
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.060]   - No.
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:17.900]   - What a surprise.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.300]   - I mean, it was a good conversation.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.460]   - I'm so shocked.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.140]   The minute you said the word marginal,
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.340]   I was like, "Goddammit, this is going nowhere."
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.900]   So two people who are too smart for their own good,
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.540]   I love that you brought it up and talked about it,
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.980]   but I actually, for most people listening,
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.700]   they're not gonna use the word marginal.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.060]   And $5,000 would actually be very meaningful.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.540]   So I totally agree with you that there are places
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:44.420]   we can look in our own spending and optimize it, 100%.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.300]   That comes after identifying what you love.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.700]   So I use the CEO strategy.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.860]   You can cut costs, you can earn more,
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.860]   you can optimize your existing spending.
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.620]   Optimizing would be setting up a reminder once a year,
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.140]   check your insurance, negotiate your cable,
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.980]   check all the benefits on your credit cards
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.540]   and evaluate whether you really need them,
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.420]   evaluate your subscriptions and many other tools
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.660]   that are available that can help people do that.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.820]   That right there can often save you
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.900]   well over $1,000 a year, well over it.
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.180]   Now, here's the key, everybody forgets.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:19.100]   If you save $1,000 or $2,000 a year,
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:23.340]   make sure you redirect that money to the places you want,
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:27.260]   otherwise it will simply get sucked up by day-to-day life.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.340]   And that's a lesson that I learned
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:29.500]   from someone who's very wise.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.820]   He's a little older than me.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.260]   He told me, "Rameeth, when you have kids,
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:36.440]   "if you don't prioritize your relationship
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.420]   "with your partner, your kids will suck up
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.980]   "every minute of your time.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.000]   "And it's great to spend time with them,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.380]   "of course you love them, but you've got
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.300]   "to set pillars in the ground for you and your partner.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.760]   "And that's the same with money.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.340]   "If you don't prioritize where your money flows,
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.460]   "and it's not flowing to something
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.340]   "that's part of your rich life,
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.780]   "it will simply get sucked up by random expenses
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.900]   "and you will have no idea where it went."
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.380]   - You brought up budgeting a lot.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.780]   Is that at least a practical way
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.100]   to get a sense of where you're spending
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:06.340]   if someone doesn't have a good sense of it?
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.260]   - If you want to budget for the last 30 days
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.260]   of your spending, fine.
[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.100]   That's fine.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.140]   I'm not a fan of budgeting.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:13.120]   It doesn't work.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.460]   It's very difficult for people.
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:15.420]   It makes them feel bad.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.020]   And worst of all, it's backwards looking.
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.260]   It doesn't really tell you anything.
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.620]   I much prefer to have four key numbers to track
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.100]   and then get on with my life.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.940]   So the four key numbers are fixed costs,
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:29.300]   which should be 50 to 60% of your take-home pay.
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.740]   And that would include your mortgage or rent,
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.300]   utilities, insurance, any debt payments, auto,
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.500]   everything that's fixed.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.500]   Groceries that stay roughly the same every month.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.700]   Next would be savings.
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.780]   That would be roughly five to 10%.
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.220]   Next would be investments, roughly five to 10%.
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.300]   Of course, the more the better
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.620]   'cause you can turn a dollar into many more.
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.300]   And finally, my favorite of all,
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:55.900]   guilt-free spending, 20 to 35% of take-home.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.000]   Now, I love that last one
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.700]   because suddenly if you go out to a really nice restaurant
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.600]   or you wanna get a babysitter one night
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.360]   so you can go out with your wife or whatever,
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.620]   you don't have to feel guilty.
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.780]   You don't have to feel anxious.
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.580]   You don't have to worry about getting the 9.99 blueberries
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.580]   because you go, I already hit all my other numbers.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.940]   My fixed costs are already being taken care of automatically.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.840]   My savings, my investments, all that is automatic.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.020]   I have allocated this money
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.160]   for us to spend on the things we love,
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.260]   whether it's food, a beautiful coat,
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:31.260]   an Uber so that you can go have a nice time, whatever.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:34.020]   That is being intentional with your money.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.100]   So four numbers,
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.020]   those are straight from my conscious spending plan.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.100]   That's the numbers that I pay attention to.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.620]   - It's funny 'cause when I say budgeting,
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.260]   I don't actually mean budgeting.
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.140]   I mean kind of what you're describing there.
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.380]   It's like having a grasp
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.660]   of how much you spend each month on fixed things
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.420]   and how much is left in between.
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.420]   - The difference is, first of all,
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.320]   when people think of budgeting, they already hate it.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.820]   Okay, it feels horrible.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.660]   It feels like a lot of work, which it is.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:02.340]   And it's mostly minutia.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.700]   I don't track the price of a snap piece.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.420]   It's not worth the time.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.100]   And people who budget,
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.500]   they spend more time recategorizing stuff
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.020]   and plugging numbers in and checking it all
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.020]   than they do actually living their rich life.
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:18.500]   That's backwards.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.780]   The hard work of a rich life is creating the vision
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.820]   and becoming basically financially fluent,
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.500]   knowing what a savings rate is,
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.020]   understanding your asset allocation.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.060]   There's like five to 10 big wins in life.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.060]   Nail those.
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.420]   You never have to track the price
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.940]   of Reese's Pieces peanut butter cups.
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:35.780]   You shouldn't.
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.540]   That's a $3 question.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:41.960]   The $30,000 question is, hey, what's our savings rate?
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.520]   And can we increase it by 1% per year?
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.540]   If you do that, that's worth actually over $300,000.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.580]   It will make up for all the coffee you ever buy
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.660]   in your entire life.
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.260]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.100]   I get it.
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.780]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.660]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.740]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.700]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.620]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.580]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.340]   take care of the supplies.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.180]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:20.020]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.420]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.420]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.900]   or maybe you just want to celebrate
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.980]   that you got through another week.
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.060]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.620]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.380]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.460]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.140]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.700]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.680]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.700]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.540]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.620]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.260]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.740]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.380]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:59.660]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.660]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.900]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:11.660]   With travel back on the calendar and my kid in preschool,
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.620]   I need an easy way to optimize my immune system
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.080]   and get some extra energy every day,
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.920]   which is why I kickstart my day
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.020]   with AG1 from Athletic Greens,
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.620]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.140]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.880]   because I think it's the best option
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.740]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.500]   You take one scoop of AG1
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.220]   and you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.500]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.460]   probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.940]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:46.100]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.140]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.660]   and energized for the day,
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.180]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.940]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:58.980]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.740]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.820]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.700]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:09.180]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:14.060]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:18.700]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.340]   to take ownership over your health
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.340]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.940]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.420]   and supporting the show.

[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:42.460]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.180]   So a little bit ago, you mentioned
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.220]   there are a few things you hear that are red flags.
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:48.020]   I'm curious if there are any other things
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.420]   that people should be listening for
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.020]   as ways for them to say, "Oh, you know what?
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.980]   "Maybe there's an opportunity to improve."
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.860]   But also the counter of that are,
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.880]   I don't know if it's a green flag or a checkered flag,
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.340]   but are there things that when you hear people doing,
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.860]   you're like, "Oh, they're doing it right in this area."
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.340]   - Well, you mentioned what you and your wife
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.820]   just like talking about money.
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:07.700]   That's a huge red flag.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.900]   The fact that you are just talking about it regularly
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.140]   while on a walk is awesome.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:13.980]   Awesome.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.580]   You're talking about it proactively.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.140]   The two of you are having conversations.
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:20.980]   That right there, it normalizes talking about money.
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.580]   And for everybody, that's why I encourage
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.980]   a monthly Rich Life Review and have a structure for it.
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.900]   You always start off with a compliment.
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:32.140]   I really appreciate that you always book
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:33.500]   the best flights for our family.
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.440]   I know that I never have to worry
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.380]   about the flights we're gonna take.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:37.340]   You do an amazing job.
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.500]   I love you.
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.380]   It's such a beautiful way to start off talking about money
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:42.820]   and to really set the intention.
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:43.980]   It sounds a little formal.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.260]   A lot of people going, "That's weird.
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.700]   "I really don't care if it sounds weird.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.540]   "I want you to feel good.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:48.660]   "I want your partner to feel good
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.820]   "and for you two to be connected."
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:55.820]   Other green flags I see are when couples look at each other
[00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:59.180]   and they often say, "What do you think?"
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.860]   Huge green flag.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.340]   In many relationships I speak to,
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.100]   I'll hear one person talking
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.980]   and the other will share their piece.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:10.000]   And after an hour or so, I'll ask one of them,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.480]   "Do you ever ask your partner questions about money?"
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.820]   And they'll go, "No."
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.780]   I go, "Do you ever ask your partner questions at all?"
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:20.140]   They go, "No, not really."
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.380]   I go, "Did your mom or your dad
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:25.780]   "ever ask their partner questions?
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.020]   "No."
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.700]   And so these things are passed down.
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.260]   Can you imagine being in a relationship
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.060]   where your partner never actually asks you a question?
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.200]   That's a red flag.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.780]   But a green flag is when they pause.
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:36.620]   They say, "What do you think?
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:37.440]   "Gosh, I'm stuck.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.860]   "Can you help me out with this one?"
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.460]   That is when you know you've got a solid foundation.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:42.980]   - And if there are things that you realize,
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.100]   and we talked about this earlier,
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.180]   where like I grew up and we always said I can't afford it.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.300]   You said you can't just change.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.500]   You can't just say get over it.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.460]   - Nope.
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.960]   - Does just knowing where it comes from
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.200]   and understanding that's why I did it,
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.340]   does that just make it better?
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:57.340]   Or what's the way to move forward?
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.260]   - That is a huge first step,
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:04.340]   is to understand that the way you feel about money
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:07.980]   is highly uncorrelated to how much you've got in the bank.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.100]   See, we believe that.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.180]   We are meaning-making creatures.
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.980]   So we will have some odd thing,
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:16.740]   like you mentioned you feel so bad
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.500]   about buying $9 blueberries,
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.780]   which, look, I don't think you're doing that every day,
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.940]   but once in a while maybe you love blueberries
[00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.940]   and it's nine bucks and you just are racked
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:26.860]   with all kinds of negative feelings.
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:28.380]   We will then say to ourselves,
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.580]   we come up with a logical reason.
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.820]   Well, you know, I'd rather put that money somewhere else.
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:36.020]   Well, I could turn that $7 differential into $300
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.500]   if I invest it properly over 65 years.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.860]   But first thing we need to do is understand
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.020]   that a lot of our decisions are highly emotional
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.660]   based on where we came from.
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.940]   That alone does not change it.
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.900]   Let me give you an example from a couple that I spoke to.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.820]   This is a couple where the husband was going on a trip
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.300]   to New York for work and he invited his wife,
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.260]   said let's make a fun weekend of it.
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.500]   And she said, okay, where do you think we should stay?
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.620]   And he had this hotel that he was gonna stay
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.720]   and she said, her first question, how much does it cost?
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.540]   And he said, I don't know, it's like 300 bucks a night,
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.300]   which for Manhattan is quite reasonable.
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.980]   She said, that is outrageous, I won't do it.
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.360]   They got a different hotel in Chelsea,
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.660]   went there for the first night
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:25.020]   and then went back to the other Moxie the next night.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:28.860]   Okay, then they went throughout their stay in New York
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:30.340]   and you know what she said to me?
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.580]   She said, we wanted to get Broadway tickets.
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.860]   So we stood in the last minute ticket line.
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:38.000]   This is for people who typically come from out of town,
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.720]   they get the discount tickets, fine.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:44.340]   The only problem is they're multi, multi millionaires, okay?
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:47.120]   And so I had to find a way to show her
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.360]   that she was not living her rich life.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.180]   And she told me this, was not taking hours
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:54.280]   of her limited trip to New York City
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.960]   to stand in a line to save 100 bucks
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.760]   and get whatever tickets are left.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.020]   So here's what I did.
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:04.620]   I'm a master of Indian mom guilt because I'm Indian.
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:08.880]   And I said to her, okay, imagine the family behind you.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.600]   They came here from Wisconsin
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:15.300]   and this is their one and only family trip to New York.
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.680]   And they're hoping to get those Lion King tickets.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.000]   But then the multi-millionaire couple in front of them
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.680]   snatches the last ticket.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.800]   How do you think they're gonna feel?
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.420]   And she was almost starting to cry.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:28.120]   Now, we were having a good time with it,
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.240]   but what I wanted for her to see
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.820]   was the stakes of her decisions.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.320]   By only looking at the cost,
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.140]   she never thought about how much she could have left
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.960]   for the doorman at that hotel,
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.800]   how much she could have tipped for a server at a restaurant
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.120]   and what kind of experience
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.240]   she could have gotten with her husband.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.400]   That's what I want people to see,
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.840]   which is the stakes are high
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.400]   and it's not just about saving 50 bucks.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.720]   Nobody's gonna look back and say,
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:56.500]   wow, I optimized for $50 on my trip to New York City.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.520]   It's gonna be what kind of magical experience
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.480]   did I create with the people I love.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.480]   - One thing I try to do,
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.360]   especially when it comes to travel,
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.000]   is remember how much the trip cost
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.680]   when you're making these small decisions.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.560]   So you're going to New York,
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.400]   you're going for, you said, $300 a night.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.440]   So they're there for, let's say, four or five nights.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.560]   You know, you're spending over a thousand.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.000]   Flights, maybe another thousand.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.920]   All your meals, maybe you're spending another thousand.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.680]   You're spending $3,500.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.520]   And when you look at it in that perspective,
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.520]   you think we're spending $3,500
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:24.520]   to go on this trip for four days.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.740]   Do we wanna make a decision about one little thing
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:29.960]   for saving $100 when we lose part of our vacation, right?
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.080]   If you're spending $3,500 for three days, $1,000 a day,
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.440]   do we wanna spend our $1,000 a day
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.600]   to be in New York in line?
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.000]   - I think that having a holistic vision
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.280]   is a beautiful way to do it.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.360]   It totally changes the dynamic
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.300]   instead of, should we go to this restaurant?
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.040]   It's like, what's our vision for this trip?
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.120]   I'll give you an example.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.200]   When you're going on a trip,
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.600]   not everything has to be the best.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.600]   In fact, in my experience,
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.440]   picking the one thing that is magical
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.560]   and then the rest can be totally normal, ordinary,
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.240]   is a great way to approach it.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.720]   The approach I try to take
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.060]   is what would make this trip magical?
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.880]   On a recent trip, we went to Japan.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.360]   We didn't wanna eat at any fancy restaurants.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.700]   We'd done that a couple times.
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:11.160]   We just wanted to eat at ordinary places
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.000]   that we found and that we had tagged.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:13.840]   That's it.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.720]   So food was not an expensive part of our trip whatsoever.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.400]   And that actually is a huge relief
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.600]   to talk about that ahead of time,
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.040]   be like, hey, what would make this magical?
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:25.120]   I'm actually not feeling the need to go to XYZ
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.080]   or we can't afford it.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.120]   Cool, that's totally fine.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.560]   But pick one thing that would make it magical.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.880]   It could be a food tour.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.560]   It could be a behind the scenes thing
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.720]   that you find on Airbnb experiences, whatever it may be.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:41.040]   That to me is something you will always remember.
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:41.880]   - I like that idea.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:44.000]   I don't know if you know the peak end part of travel.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.440]   You wanna have the peak experience
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.920]   and then you wanna have the end be great.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.760]   - I like that.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:51.200]   What it really reminds me of is creating rules
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.200]   for the important things in your life.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.520]   So I have my own 10 money rules.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.840]   My wife and I are starting to create our joint rules.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.280]   And so for example, when we travel somewhere,
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.080]   we talk about where we're gonna stay.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.240]   We talk about how long.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.160]   So we have one rule, which is a minimum of four days
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:10.640]   because leisure is the ultimate luxury
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.560]   to be able to slow down and not have to rush around.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.480]   We recently got a photographer when we were in Japan
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.640]   to take some photos of us and we just loved it.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.240]   We're like, wow, we're always gonna remember this trip
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.800]   because of these awesome photos.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.480]   And so we go, cool, let's make that a rule.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.680]   Every time we travel somewhere,
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.680]   we're gonna get a photographer
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.920]   so we can remember that experience.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.280]   Again, these can be really inexpensive things.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:35.640]   One person I know, the day they land, they go out to eat.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.480]   Love it.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.960]   Simple example.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.960]   Could be 15 bucks.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.800]   But the idea is you're coming up with these rules together
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.480]   and really creating that vision.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.840]   That is when you've built a beautiful connection
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:47.680]   with your partner.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.320]   Do you have any money rules with your wife?
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.200]   - So when we had our last conversation,
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.760]   I can't believe it was almost two years ago,
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.000]   it was early episode of the podcast.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.840]   You shared your personal money rules
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.440]   and we talked about coming up with them.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.720]   And I know we probably sat down and made up a few,
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.840]   but I wouldn't say I committed to any,
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.040]   to the point that you could list yours off, right?
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.840]   I know this one, I know this one, I know this one.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.680]   I think we kind of generally agreed on a lot of things,
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:11.800]   but I don't think I've written them down.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:12.840]   So I've got some homework.
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.600]   The reason I like money rules,
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.560]   I say this as someone who hasn't put them in stone,
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.800]   is that it just kind of makes the decision go away.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:19.840]   - Yes.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.200]   - You make the money rule of,
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.680]   I am never going to care about how much berries cost.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.840]   Let's say I make that rule.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:26.920]   It's like, if I want blueberries
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.520]   and the big box is $8, great.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:32.400]   But if the tiny box is $9, doesn't matter.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.680]   You got to buy it because you committed in advance.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.520]   - Yeah.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.560]   And you choose those rules
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:40.040]   knowing that you can easily afford it.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.720]   No one's going, oh, my rule is I'm going to fly private
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.640]   every day and you can't afford it.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.360]   That would not make any sense.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:49.200]   But for you, the price of blueberries is irrelevant.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.680]   It's totally irrelevant.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.680]   Now, I would not have made the blueberry rule
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.480]   when I was 17 years old.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.080]   I couldn't have afforded it.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:56.920]   For a lot of people, they're like,
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.520]   who the hell cares about blueberries?
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.000]   Cool, not your rule.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   But I love the idea of coming up with these rules
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.640]   and writing them down.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:07.040]   And it also becomes a really fun exercise to do together.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.080]   It's dreamy, it's aspirational,
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.360]   and you can agree on something small to start.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.000]   And as time goes on and finances allow it,
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.200]   you can expand it.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.120]   That's really part of a beautiful, rich life.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.680]   - I think the one rule we do have,
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:25.640]   and it's our version of not having personal savings buckets,
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:29.120]   is just that anything under $200, ask permission.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.220]   - That's your worry-free number, awesome.
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.040]   - I think we've had an offline conversation
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.120]   at one point about, is that number the right number?
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.480]   So we won't go there. - No, it's not.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.960]   - But it's great that you set it up.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.160]   That's 99% of it, who cares?
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:42.080]   The number itself can be tuned, whatever.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.360]   It's like a savings rate.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.400]   Oh, should it be 5% or 7%?
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.240]   Okay, we could figure that out, that's math.
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:50.000]   But the idea that you even know what a savings rate is
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.480]   or a worry-free number, and you've set it up automatically,
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.660]   that is amazing.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.120]   That's a green flag right there.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.440]   - The funny thing, though, is because now my wife and I
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.000]   both become a bit of an optimizer,
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.720]   a bit of a hacker of sorts.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.080]   And so my version of it and her version is,
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:08.320]   well, if I could spend $500 without any questions,
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:11.240]   as long as I have the intent of returning
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.560]   more than $300 of what I purchased,
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.480]   the net amount would probably end up being $200.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.040]   And so I remember she definitely said,
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.240]   "Hey, have you noticed that there was a $600 charge?
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:21.920]   "Don't worry, most of it will get returned,
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:22.760]   "it doesn't matter."
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.400]   Or it's like, "Oh, I wanna buy an iPhone."
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.160]   It's like, "Well, if I do the Apple plan,
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.200]   "it's only $100 a month,
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.260]   "so I'm not making $1,000 purchase,
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.020]   "I'm making $1,100 purchase."
[00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.520]   I'll tell you what I like about this,
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:33.840]   even though I find that a little odd,
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.160]   but hey, it's your rich life, it's not mine.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.440]   So what I really like about this is
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.560]   the two of you are talking about it regularly
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.560]   and you have a good attitude about it.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:43.920]   Like the fact that you're laughing,
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.320]   and I can tell that you and your wife
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.040]   like laughed about this and you joke about it.
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.320]   And you're even making jokes about the optimizer thing.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.960]   That is cool.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.200]   That's how it should be.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.640]   So many times when I talk to couples about money,
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.320]   or if you're listening right now,
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.140]   money does not feel like that.
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:02.800]   It feels tense and rigid,
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.300]   and like you're walking on eggshells,
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.320]   whether you're solo or with a partner.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:09.320]   And in order to become confident with money,
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:12.120]   like you are, Chris, the way you're talking about it,
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.600]   you gotta be competent.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.920]   You gotta know what a savings rate is.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.960]   You have to have talked about,
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.520]   hey, what do we feel comfortable on?
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.560]   And it's okay if your number's different than somebody else.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.240]   Fine, it's your rich life.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.880]   But I love you modeling what excitement
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.000]   and confidence and competence looks like.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.880]   For someone listening,
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.160]   there's an arsenal of episodes in your podcast
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.120]   they could go listen to.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.200]   Is there one or two you'd wanna suggest someone
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.960]   who's heard this conversation,
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:40.040]   kind of comes from the attitude of,
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.600]   I like to optimize, I like to organize my life,
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:45.200]   should go and start off with as a good intro
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.280]   if they haven't heard your show before?
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.760]   - Yeah, I've got two episodes
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:50.040]   that I wanna recommend to people.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.680]   First off, episode 20.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.800]   My wife is going to divorce me
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.840]   unless I can stop being so cheap.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.760]   It's absolutely fantastic.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:02.320]   If you or your partner is a high net worth person,
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.560]   or one of you is cheap in the relationship,
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.400]   or sometimes both of you are cheap, listen to that one.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:11.760]   Also, in episode 80, if I add any more
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:14.840]   to our $50,000 of credit card debt,
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.520]   he will ask for a divorce.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:22.080]   This is a cerebral and deeply psychological episode
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.360]   where you're gonna learn that money is rarely
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:25.560]   just about the numbers.
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:26.880]   It goes much deeper.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.720]   So those are some that I would highly recommend
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.000]   to people to start with.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.720]   - But also, you should definitely,
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:32.640]   like I said in the intro,
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.120]   go check out at least the first three minutes
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.200]   of the show on Netflix.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.040]   - Yeah, I'd love it.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.080]   If you go to Netflix,
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.800]   the show is called "How to Get Rich,"
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:42.280]   and watch the first three minutes
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.200]   and send me a note about what you think.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:47.920]   Send me a note, you can DM me, email me, tweet me,
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.400]   but watch the first three minutes
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.200]   of "How to Get Rich" on Netflix.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.160]   It is a different way of looking at money.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.400]   - I'm excited for the show.
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.160]   Ramin, any final parting advice
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:58.520]   or places people should stay in touch
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:58:59.360]   with what you're working on?
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.960]   - You can follow me on Twitter, on Instagram,
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:07.160]   and I am doing a behind-the-scenes pop-up newsletter
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.400]   of what it was like to shoot a Netflix show.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.920]   A lot of people are like, "How'd you get the show?
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:13.240]   "What's it like shooting?
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.320]   "Is it real?"
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:18.240]   So I'm doing that at iwt.com/netflix
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.440]   for the next couple of weeks.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.280]   - Cool.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.120]   Awesome.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.400]   Ramin, thank you so much for being here again.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.480]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:27.720]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.480]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.000]   If you haven't already left a rating
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.400]   and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.120]   I would really appreciate it.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:37.560]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:39.920]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:44.200]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:45.280]   That's it for this week.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.440]   I'll see you next week.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.320]   (electronic music)
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.240]   (electronic music)
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:58.280]   (electronic music)
