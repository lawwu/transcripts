[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.400]   - You said LiDAR came into the game early on
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.240]   and it's really the primary driver
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.600]   of autonomous vehicles today as a sensor.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.240]   So how important is the role of LiDAR
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.140]   in the sensor suite in the near term?
[00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.060]   - So I think it's essential.
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.000]   You know, I believe,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.840]   but I also believe the cameras are essential
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.440]   and I believe the radar is essential.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.440]   I think that you really need to use the composition of data
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.020]   from these different sensors
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.940]   if you want the thing to really be robust.
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.680]   - The question I wanna ask,
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.880]   let's see if we can untangle it,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.200]   is what are your thoughts
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.560]   on the Elon Musk provocative statement
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.640]   that LiDAR is a crutch,
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.640]   that is a kind of, I guess, growing pains,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.200]   and that much of the perception task
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.400]   can be done with cameras.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.760]   - So I think it is undeniable
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.680]   that people walk around without lasers in their foreheads
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.200]   and they can get into vehicles and drive them.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.920]   And so there's an existence proof
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.900]   that you can drive using passive vision.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.040]   No doubt, can't argue with that.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.640]   - In terms of sensors, yeah.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.320]   - Yeah, in terms of sensors, right?
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.520]   So like there's an example that we all go do it,
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.680]   many of us every day.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.600]   In terms of LiDAR being a crutch, sure.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.480]   But in the same way that the combustion engine
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.680]   was a crutch on the path to an electric vehicle,
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.720]   in the same way that any technology ultimately gets
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.800]   replaced by some superior technology in the future.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.120]   And really, the way that I look at this
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.840]   is that the way we get around on the ground,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.300]   the way that we use transportation is broken.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.280]   And that we have this,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.120]   what was, I think the number I saw this morning,
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.440]   37,000 Americans killed last year on our roads.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.760]   And that's just not acceptable.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.840]   And so any technology that we can bring to bear
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.240]   that accelerates this self-driving technology
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.040]   coming to market and saving lives
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.820]   is technology we should be using.
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.240]   And it feels just arbitrary to say,
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.240]   well, I'm not okay with using lasers
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.200]   because that's whatever,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.120]   but I am okay with using an eight megapixel camera
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.280]   or a 16 megapixel camera.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.040]   These are just bits of technology
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.760]   and we should be taking the best technology
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.640]   from the tool bin that allows us to go
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.980]   and solve a problem.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.040]   - The question I often talk to,
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.520]   well, obviously you do as well,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.680]   to the sort of automotive companies.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.760]   And if there's one word that comes up more often
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.000]   than anything, it's cost.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.680]   And trying to drive costs down.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.680]   So while it's true that it's a tragic number, the 37,000,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.280]   the question is, and I'm not the one asking this question
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.200]   'cause I hate this question,
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.360]   but we want to find the cheapest sensor suite
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.680]   that creates a safe vehicle.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   So in that uncomfortable trade-off,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.640]   do you foresee LiDAR coming down in cost in the future
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.080]   or do you see a day where level four autonomy
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.280]   is possible without LiDAR?
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.260]   - I see both of those, but it's really a matter of time.
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.440]   And I think really, maybe I would talk to the question
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.240]   you asked about the cheapest sensor.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.760]   I don't think that's actually what you want.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   What you want is a sensor suite that is economically viable.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.880]   And then after that, everything is about margin
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.780]   and driving cost out of the system.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.840]   What you also want is a sensor suite that works.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.840]   And so it's great to tell a story about how it would be
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.760]   better to have a self-driving system with a $50 sensor
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.460]   instead of a $500 sensor.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.960]   But if the $500 sensor makes it work
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.200]   and the $50 sensor doesn't work, who cares?
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.440]   So long as you can actually have an economic,
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.960]   there's an economic opportunity there.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.200]   And the economic opportunity is important
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.200]   because that's how you actually have a sustainable business.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.560]   And that's how you can actually see this come to scale
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.840]   and be out in the world.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.240]   And so when I look at LiDAR,
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.320]   I see a technology that has no underlying
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.840]   fundamentally expense to it, fundamental expense to it.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.520]   It's going to be more expensive than an imager
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.800]   because CMOS processes or fab processes
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.520]   are dramatically more scalable than mechanical processes,
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.760]   but we still should be able to drive cost down
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.560]   substantially on that side.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.320]   And then I also do think that with the right business model,
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.000]   you can absorb more,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.880]   certainly more cost on the bill of materials.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.040]   - Yeah, if the sensor suite works, extra value is provided,
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.920]   thereby you don't need to drive costs down to zero.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.160]   It's the basic economics.
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.920]   (air whooshing)
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.580]   (air whooshing)
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.240]   (air whooshing)
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.900]   (air whooshing)
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.560]   (air whooshing)
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.220]   (air whooshing)
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:47.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
