[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   All right, besties. I think that was another epic discussion. People love the interviews.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.560]   I could hear him talk for hours. Absolutely. We crush your questions, I admit it. We are
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.720]   giving people ground truth data to underwrite your own opinion. What do you guys think?
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.800]   That was fun. That was great.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.800]   Dave Ricks, welcome to the All In interview.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.800]   Great to be here.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.640]   Yeah, we had dinner together a couple of months ago and have been in touch. And obviously,
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.920]   I'm really excited to talk to you today about the work you're doing at Eli Lilly. So just
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.760]   for the audience, Dave is the CEO of Eli Lilly, which is the world's most valuable pharmaceutical
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.520]   company and the leader in the GLP-1 drug market, which some analysts have said could grow to
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.880]   as much as $150 billion in annual revenue over the next 10 years. Really kind of an
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.960]   extraordinary story. And Dave, you became CEO of Lilly in January 2017, when Lilly had
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.520]   a market cap of just $70 billion, following a year of $22 billion in revenue and $3.5
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.720]   in operating income. And today, Lilly's market cap is an astounding $878 billion, and the
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.600]   company is projected to do $46 billion in revenue and $15 billion in operating income
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.560]   this year. And few companies in history, I'd say, have seen such an extraordinary rise
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.920]   in revenue, profit, market value at this scale. Maybe Nvidia recently, which I'd say is the
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.920]   only company that kind of beat your performance in recent years. But I don't know of any that
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.180]   are not founder-led, maybe Satya running Microsoft, but it took him a little bit longer. So today,
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.960]   I'm really excited to talk to you about the work you're doing at Lilly, the chronic health
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.720]   problem of obesity and diabetes, GLP-1s, and what's happening in that market, what those
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.360]   products do, and the business of Eli Lilly. So thanks so much for being here, Dave.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.320]   Yeah, excited to be here. I'm a big fan of the pod, so I'm excited to be on.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.840]   That's great. Sorry you don't get harassed by the other three today, it's just me. So
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.700]   this is an extended science corner for all the nerds at home that wanted it, with a deep
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.360]   dive on an amazing business. So we'll start off by talking about the chronic health epidemic
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.360]   of obesity. According to the CDC, 74% of Americans are now overweight or clinically obese. Your
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.200]   statistics might be different. This condition is driving what is arguably the largest health
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.040]   epidemic in human history. Obesity and all the associated diseases like type 2 diabetes
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.980]   have so many negative health implications for our populations. And this has risen dramatically
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.640]   over the past 50 years, it's becoming a global problem. So let me pull up a couple of images
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.200]   we can use as we have this conversation here, Dave, and we'll dialogue about this. But obviously,
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.440]   what humans eat, what we consume has changed dramatically. Particularly here in the US,
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.000]   we've seen the American diet shift to a much more kind of caloric, lower nutrient density
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.520]   diet over the last 50 years. The average daily calorie consumed by Americans since 1961 has
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.400]   driven up from 2800 to about 3600. And you know, that sounds like a small number, but
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.360]   when you add it up over 365 days a year, it leads to a pretty dramatic increase in in
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.920]   obesity rates. This is a great chart that shows how the availability of calories and
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.760]   the consumption of calories in a population significantly correlates with the rate of
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.700]   obesity in that particular country. And the United States obviously has the largest caloric
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.480]   supply of any developed nation, and also has the highest percentage of people that are
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.840]   overweight or obese. And I would argue that many of the improvements that we've seen in
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.640]   agricultural technology and many of the systems in food that have made calories cheaper have
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.120]   resulted in this kind of surplus problem that has led to an obesity epidemic. And just looking
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.720]   at the US rates over the last 2025 years, you know, we see today, as I mentioned before,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.320]   75% of people overweight or obese and in this particular slide, we're showing 35% of obese
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:10.080]   and severe obese to today, 51% of Americans are either obese or severely obese, really
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.120]   extraordinary. And this is not just in the US as the calorie supplies increased around
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.320]   the world. We see obesity rates climbing in every developed nation, from Brazil to Mexico
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.360]   and now even recently in India. And so this is becoming a global problem. And I think,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.040]   you know, Dave, maybe you could talk a little bit about the scale of the problem. I think
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.960]   you've highlighted a lot of this in your investor presentations. And this is one of your slides
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.160]   that you've used. So maybe you can kind of share how you guys forecast the obesity epidemic
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.840]   and the effect it's having worldwide.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.160]   Yeah, that's a great backgrounder as it gets kicked off. You know, one thing just pointing
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   out on the data you showed, some people notice a difference in the caloric intake numbers
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.000]   versus the kind of the macronutrient, micronutrient story, you go back. Yeah. So like the severe
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.120]   obesity in particular, kicking up, you know, the next slide there. Yeah. Kicking up almost
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.880]   doubling right in the last 20 years, whereas caloric intake certainly isn't moving at that
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.520]   same rate. So, you know, I think as we think about the problem, of course excess calories
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.560]   versus expenditure is a key part, but so is probably the ultra processed food story, which
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.240]   you didn't have data on there, but it is, you know, I think in the US we're now eating
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.320]   two thirds of our calories in our country are ultra processed. Yeah. And that compares
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.120]   to like 35% in Europe. So that's gotta be part of this equation as well. But no matter
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.120]   the cause, like if you go to that first slide I had, we now see about a billion people on
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.640]   the planet with clinical obesity or overweight. And as you're pointing out, probably that's
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.560]   going to grow a lot more in the developed or developing world than the developed world.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.120]   There's a function of wealth accumulation and surplus food abundance basically that
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.560]   will drive this. India I think is 11% of the population's obese, but projected to go as
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.520]   much as 30% in the next 20 years. So on that population base, that alone would add almost
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:22.040]   half a billion people to this chart. Yeah. So your projection is obesity worldwide will
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:28.080]   affect about a billion people by 2030. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:35.600]   And the problem with obesity is that it has an effect on many of the systems of the human
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.320]   body. Maybe you can highlight kind of how obesity, you know, causes many of the chronic
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.920]   health conditions and ailments that simply weren't around maybe a hundred years ago,
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.280]   but are certainly becoming far more frequent today. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the first
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.780]   order effect of course, is on your metabolic processes in here, like cardiovascular disease,
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:01.360]   how we process lipids and other energy sources that leads to cardiovascular disease and it's
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.400]   other associated risks like stroke. I mean, there's a pretty new disease here called under
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.960]   the liver disease, which is what used to be called Nash is now confusingly called mash,
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.120]   but it's the same disease. It's fatty liver disease. And 30 years ago, like clinically
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.920]   you couldn't really find this in the adult population. And now it's one of the most common
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.680]   conditions obese people suffer from. And it ends up in fibrosis of the liver. And as you
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.840]   know, like we have a lot of every organ that's important, we have redundancy and accept the
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:39.120]   liver. So when your liver goes south, it's a bad news story for human health. Transplant
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:44.480]   is the only escape from that. We've got some new data on our drug. That used to be a disease
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.480]   limited to severe alcoholism. Right? Exactly. And, and that's the Nash word is actually
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.840]   starts with non-alcoholic fatty liver. So, but now there's much more, um, obesity driven
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.920]   fatty liver than any other cause, uh, as you're pointing out, but it results in transplant
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   and terrible, uh, outcomes long-term. So, so much of the, the health problems, the chronic
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:14.160]   health issues that we deal with as a modern society are probably rooted. Many of them
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:20.480]   are rooted in the obesity epidemic. Yeah. So 230 diseases have been connected and you
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.440]   have these, these ones that are more like directly because of the caloric imbalance
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.800]   and fat accumulation. And then you have these ones in blue are sort of like derivative,
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.240]   like obstructive sleep apnea. That's like 14 million Americans have CPAP machines. And
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.280]   why? Because there's so much, um, fat accumulation around your respiratory system. You wake yourself
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.960]   up at night to breathe and GERD, of course, that's, you know, reflux, et cetera. So these
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.880]   are like more of the second order of fact. And then interestingly, you've got the mood
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.720]   anxiety pieces here. And there's an interesting study done by Epic. You know, they're the
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:01.120]   big health record company, which is retrospective and not tightly controlled, but it showed
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:08.320]   people on GLP one drugs. Incretins had remarkably lower rates of new clinical depression diagnoses,
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:14.520]   which is an interesting thing as well. So a lot of, uh, a lot of impacts, uh, obesity,
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.400]   like type two diabetes itself, which is an inability for the body to respond with an
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.080]   appropriate amount of insulin when there's glucose in the blood itself has a number of
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:30.360]   follow on effects. Obviously diabetes as, as many know, um, has become on its own, a
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:38.000]   chronic health epidemic. Uh, it can cause nephropathy. Uh, so damage to the kidneys,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.440]   which has a significant effect on our ability to regulate protein in our body, diabetic
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.080]   retinopathy, hemorrhaging in the eyes, uh, that ultimately can lead to blindness. So
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.920]   having too much blood sugar and not having an ability to produce enough insulin to bring
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.520]   down the blood sugar level can, can lead to all these chronic health effects, which has
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.400]   made a bum. Yeah. And those are the micro vascular ones. There's the, I mean, the risk
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.680]   of heart attack. If you have type two diabetes is four times people who don't have diabetes.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.280]   Yeah. So you also have the macro vascular, uh, events, stroke, heart attack. Okay. So
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:18.360]   the treatment for diabetes used to be insulin, right? And insulin. And if I remember the
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:25.440]   history of Eli Lilly correctly, uh, Eli Lilly was the first American company, uh, to produce
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:33.960]   insulin, which was done with initially processing, I believe pigs or cows, uh, to, to, to get
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.280]   the insulin. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's an interesting story. So we were the first company, period.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.480]   Um, there's a Danish company, Novo, who's our competitor in this space. We can come
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.000]   back to that. Cause it's not a coincidence. I remember the history of the, of the relationship.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.160]   It's a really interesting history between the two companies, but yeah, kind of intertwined.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:56.040]   Yeah. But we, we had a, like our head of science, uh, met with Toronto, this research set up
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.880]   there who discovered the mechanism of insulin, but they couldn't make it into a medicine.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.200]   We produced the process that made it available at scale, which as you're pointing out, was
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.440]   derived from like a lot of the, you know, the history of our industry was like taking
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.400]   things in nature and refining them into medicine. And that was the case with insulin. We took
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:21.200]   something in nature, the pancreases of slaughtered meat animals, uh, really cows and pigs and
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.680]   essentially refined out of that, the protein, which is insulin. And that was the case until
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:32.360]   1981 where we had partnered with Genentech to do another first, which is great. The first
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.640]   biotechnology product on planet earth, which was human insulin made in a, in a bacterial
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.200]   cell. Yeah. So in that case, that was the first recombinant biologic product, right?
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   It was putting the genetic, the genetic code from human DNA that codes for human insulin
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.240]   into an E. coli bacteria. And you put that E. coli bacteria in a giant vat. And just
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.480]   like we ferment wine, we put sugar in and it started to make insulin. And that's how
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.440]   we make insulin around the world today is through that recombinant process. Right? Yeah,
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.400]   that's right. Still. And that was the first DNA based product, uh, made in, it solved
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.320]   the problem because we were actually, we had, we had per the obesity discussion, rising
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.120]   type two diabetes rates. It used to be type one diabetes, which is the childhood form.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.680]   That's really an autoimmune disease, um, was most of the diabetes that needed insulin.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.400]   But as this, uh, you know, abundancy grew and people got heavier, we saw earlier and
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.920]   earlier onset type two diabetes, which is the adult form. And we, we were worried we're
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.320]   going to run out of animals to slaughtered animal pancreases to refine. So it wasn't
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.640]   just a cool science thing. It was actually solving a pretty big public health problem,
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.680]   which was the risk of scarcity of insulin. Yeah. Yeah. And so look, I mean, biotech to
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:52.600]   the, to the rescue and we'll talk more about biologic drugs and all the other things that
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.640]   that have been addressed with recombinant systems, uh, meaning we put DNA and microbes
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.240]   and get those microbes to make a protein for us. And obviously there's been a lot of advancements
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.400]   in that space. It's probably worth, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars today. But,
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.320]   um, let's, let's fast forward to what happened after insulin. It sounds like in the history
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:18.640]   of, of research into diabetes and understanding some of these underlying mechanisms, uh, there
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:24.160]   was this discovery of GLP one at one point and let me try and explain it and you tell
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:31.920]   me if I get it right, but okay. GLP one, it sounds like is a protein that is expressed
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.880]   by L cells. These are little cells in the small intestine of a human. So when we eat
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:44.560]   food, those cells recognize that there's food in the intestines and they pump out a protein
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:51.040]   called GLP one. And that protein goes into the bloodstream and flows all over our body
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:57.600]   and turns on and off different parts of different cells telling them, Hey, there's food in the,
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.220]   in the intestines. So tells your brain, don't be hungry. But it also has other effects like
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:09.440]   secreting insulin, getting cells to make insulin. And as a result, GLP one is what's called
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.100]   a hormone. It's a regulator of all these different cells to do things when our intestines are
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.060]   full of food. Is that an accurate way of kind of describing what a GLP, what the GLP one
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.400]   protein is? Yeah, that was perfect. I would just step back one step though and say there's
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.760]   a broad, there's like a super family of these things. And this is going to come up later
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.140]   in the, when you're talking about the drugs, which we call incretins. And this was derived
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:36.760]   from a, even earlier on your chart here in the seventies, they observed that if you give
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:42.320]   someone nutrients intravenously, meaning it bypasses the GI system, that you have a higher
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:49.600]   spike in glucose than if you give it via the GI tract. So that's a curiosity, right? Which
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.120]   is why is that the GI tract was doing something and they call that the Incretin effect. And
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.920]   later we found out that there's a whole family, a super family really of these hormones signaling
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.640]   tools that are telling your body when you're fed to do different things. That makes a lot
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.800]   of sense because to survive as humans, feeding is like one of the top three essential processes
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:15.400]   next to breathing and other things. And so there's a lot of redundancy, but also different
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.320]   hormones for different chores. And GLP-1 was the first one that was made into a drug.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.200]   And so in 1987, it was discovered that GLP-1 actually stimulates insulin production, insulin
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:34.560]   secretion, and then it was isolated. And ultimately, I mean, maybe you can tell us the history.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:40.120]   I think there was a story about Nova Nordisk and Nova having some role in some of the early
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:45.240]   work with GLP-1 versus Lilly and tell us a little bit about the history and like what
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:52.400]   took so long for GLP-1s to go from, "Hey, it stimulates insulin secretion in 1987,"
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.760]   to kind of getting these first drugs on market for GLP-1s?
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.560]   Yeah, it's a great question. Both companies played around with this mechanism right after
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.680]   that paper was published in '87. And as I've said, back to the insulin story, it's not
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.520]   really an accident because we were two companies very focused on making peptides and diabetes.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.800]   So this was a good thing to chase. But GLP-1 in its native form is not usable as a drug.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.000]   Peptides are a small molecule, a small protein, right?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.560]   Smaller protein, yeah. Less amino acids in a chain, which is what we call GLP-1 really.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.120]   It's smaller than a protein. It's a hormone, but also called a peptide. But when you give
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:33.240]   it in its native form as a medicine, it has a half-life of like minutes. So you'd have
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:39.360]   to have continuous infusion in your life to use GLP-1s in the human form as it was designed.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:45.360]   And of course, we can make it ourselves inside our bodies, but if you give it exogenously
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.920]   or from outside, you need a drug that lasts longer than a few minutes.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.760]   So both companies set to work on that problem. It was actually Lilly that launched the first
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.720]   GLP-1 drug called Exendetide, which was a strange story. Another sidebar of a company
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:09.200]   discovered that in the saliva of a Gila monster, so this is the lizard that lives in the desert.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:16.120]   In their saliva is basically a mimic of the human GLP-1. It's close but not identical.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:23.120]   The amino acid change that it had made for its purposes in saliva actually prolonged
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:30.560]   its action in man to be more like six or seven hours. So this made for a twice-a-day injection
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.040]   and it allowed us to lower blood sugar in people with diabetes and it was super successful.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.360]   It also, we noticed as happens in drug development, that you lost a little bit of weight with
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.000]   this. And we know in type 2 diabetes, that was good. In the background, Nova was working
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.520]   on their own once-a-day version and they engineered it versus found it in nature. Then Lilly made
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.480]   a once-a-week form called Duliglutide, which is now marketed as Trulicity. And then Nova
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.880]   made a weekly one, which is called Ozempic, which we now all know the name of now. And
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:08.360]   actually, not to nerd out too much on drug kinetics, but by going from daily to weekly,
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.840]   we were able to dose higher. And this is one of these situations where the glucose effect
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:18.520]   occurs at a lower dose than the weight loss effect. And we couldn't do that with a daily
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.840]   or twice-a-day drug because the side effects of these drugs, which are nausea and diarrhea,
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.800]   they're unpleasant, are kind of what we call a peak to trough effect. So you experience
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.360]   them when there's a big change in the drug in your body. But when it's steady state,
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.280]   we really reduce those symptoms. So it was really Nova's insight that we could push up
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.560]   the dose of semaglutide that allowed the obesity kind of threshold to be pushed. And then of
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.440]   course, we followed that with our latest one, Terzepatide, which is known as Monjaro. That's
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.320]   actually two hormones together. Yeah.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:54.520]   - Well, so let me just take a step back just for folks that are listening to really understand
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:01.240]   this. So all proteins are made from a chain, like a beaded necklace of amino acids being
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:07.240]   stuck together. And when they're put together, that chain kind of collapses into a molecule,
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.640]   a structure, a protein structure. And that protein has some function because it's got
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.880]   shapes and curves on it, and it can do things in the body, it can bind to things, and it
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.200]   can do activities with different cells. But you don't necessarily need to use that exact
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:26.520]   chain of amino acids to get part of that protein to bind somewhere else in the body. You can
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.960]   use things that look like that protein. And that's really the effort in all of these what
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:38.560]   are called GLP-1 agonists, which are different than GLP-1 itself. They're different molecules,
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.560]   they're different proteins, but they can bind and have the same sort of activity. So there's
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:50.400]   this discovery process, this research process, as I understand it, to develop and identify
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   new proteins that can have a similar, or perhaps even a more beneficial effect than GLP-1s
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.160]   in the body. Is that kind of fair?
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:04.520]   - Yeah, that's right. And I think this story itself is going from like finding the native
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:10.360]   human hormone, and then we found this accidentally, this one in nature that was what we call analog
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.360]   to it. So it had a similar function, but with a different kinetics, different absorption
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:21.160]   rate. And then Novo actually engineered that in lyriglutide. So they designed that in,
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.560]   and ever since then, we've been engineering in different changes in those amino acids,
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:31.240]   those beads, to drive different types of function. The latest one being this sort of dual acting
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.640]   one we have now, which like both ends, think of a chain with both ends with the active
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.560]   warhead versus just one end.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:44.600]   - Right. So over time, in 1986, we kind of realized, hey, GLP-1s stimulate insulin secretion.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.680]   So this is super interesting, and all this research begins. But since then, there have
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:55.840]   been a lot of studies on how GLP-1s maybe are regulating and affecting other organs
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:03.560]   in the human body. And I've got this chart up here that shows the effect of GLP-1 and
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.960]   GLP-1 analogs on the brain, on the heart, on the pancreas, on the liver. There are all
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.120]   these kind of interesting follow-on effects. The human body is so difficult to kind of
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.480]   map everything, but there's some intricate relationship and cross-regulatory process
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.360]   that happens between all of these different systems of the human body. So maybe you can
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:28.440]   talk about the evolution in our understanding on how GLP-1s and GLP-1 analogs maybe are
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.800]   affecting other organs in the body, not just turning off hunger and not just making more
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   insulin.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.920]   - Yeah. So of course, it's doing those two things. But as you're pointing out, a hormone
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.200]   is basically a messenger, right? So as you said earlier, it's telling your body you're
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:51.040]   fed. And with that, because nutrient absorption is like a survival instinct, and we're pre-selected
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.640]   for that, we're good at then processing that signal and acting differently. So that includes,
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.920]   you see like heart rate going up and lipid levels dropping in your cardiovascular system.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.560]   And that's because you're responding to that food, the new nutrients entered into your
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:14.880]   body. Liver is a key part of metabolism, so there's tons of cross-signaling into the liver.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.040]   And the pancreas is the source of insulin amongst other metabolic regulatory hormones.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:24.720]   So what we don't even fully understand yet though, David, which is interesting, is that
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.920]   there are primary effects of GLP-1, certainly we can reproduce like in a test tube or a
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:35.360]   cell system, but then there's a whole myriad of other probably secondary effects because
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.840]   there might be intermediate signals we don't even know about yet in this whole metabolic
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.760]   process. So some of the ones listed here, I don't think have been proven as direct effects.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:50.200]   Many of the brain ones, for instance, but clearly happen when you overstimulate GLP-1
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.960]   or give it exogenously as a medicine. And mostly in our nutrient-rich environment we
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.480]   covered earlier, these tend to be good things because you're tamping down hunger and you're
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.160]   improving absorption of the nutrients you already have.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:10.600]   Yeah. So now the topic du jour is, "Hey, we could use GLP-1s not just for the indication
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:16.960]   of obesity and diabetes, but perhaps for other health indications and maybe going after other
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.280]   issues that people are having problems with."
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.440]   Yeah. I think there's two big stories. One is that, the other is that it turns out GLP-1
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.840]   isn't the only hormone that matters. And you're going to, I mean, we already have trizepatide,
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:35.280]   which is a whole nother hormone called GIP, glucagon insulinotropic peptide, which is
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:41.280]   a complicated name, but it has more of a bias toward fat release and basically allowing
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:47.000]   your fat cells to burn energy earlier in the starvation cycle. So as you're hungry, kind
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.380]   of unleashing fat energy versus just squeezing it out of our muscles, which is what your
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:58.080]   body does naturally as kind of a survival instinct. And then we've combined that into
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.080]   trizepatide.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.800]   Next up is there's amylin-based drugs, that's another gut hormone, and glucagon, another
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:10.120]   one. So we've got triple-acting and all kinds of different ones coming. And that's a big
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.160]   part of the innovation story. I think we'll figure out through time which ones are best
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:19.440]   for what. Maintenance is a big issue in this class, inducing more rapid weight loss in
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:24.040]   people who are super obese. You know, if you have a BMI of 50 and you take trizepatide,
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:29.600]   our drug, and you lose on average 23% of your body weight, you're still obese, right? So
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.200]   we need more potency for those people. But there's many people who have a BMI of 31 and
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.320]   heart risk. They can get their BMI to normal on trizepatide or semaglutide, but how do
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.560]   they keep it there more easily versus a weekly injection? So that's another problem being
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.560]   solved.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.560]   Right.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:50.120]   The second thing, which you're touching on, is all the indications to go after. And as
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:55.320]   I mentioned earlier, there's more than 200 diseases that are tagged to obesity. Do they
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:00.400]   all cause, are they all caused by obesity? We don't know that yet. They're correlated.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:05.680]   But so far, in our studies, this category of medicine is undefeated. We've never had
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.680]   an unsuccessful study in measuring an outcome in a chronic disease. And that's probably
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:15.520]   because we stack the ones that were most possible first or most confident in. But we're working
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.960]   down that list. Currently, literally, it's 105 studies going with trizepatide in these
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.960]   other diseases.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   Wow.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.520]   So this is a massive, massive undertaking. You know, a clinical trial like that takes
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:33.840]   $100 or $200 million each. So you can do the math. It's a huge bet that we can convert
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.880]   weight loss into sustained health benefit in chronic disease.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.200]   Yeah. So that's, I mean, I'm doing the math. That's $10 to $20 billion you're spending
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:48.460]   on clinical trials for, and I understand sleep apnea, maybe Alzheimer's, chronic kidney disease.
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:53.320]   Sounds like lots of different indications where you go after a patient population, you
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.920]   try perhaps one of these combo therapies, these new combo therapies that you have.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.000]   Yeah. Trizepatide. Yeah. Manjaro.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.680]   Yeah. Right. And then you see what the results are and if it works, then a doctor can prescribe
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.680]   it, right? Yeah.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.520]   Yeah, exactly. So there's one we just read out, which we'll end up submitting, which
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.280]   is there's a lot of people, and we all may know them in our life, who say, "Oh, I was
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.600]   told I have pre-diabetes." What is that? That's, you know, otherwise healthy middle-aged adults
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.720]   who are overweight, right? And what happens, diabetes, like a lot of diseases, it's not
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:31.120]   a binary function, it's a continuous function. You begin to have resistance to your own insulin
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:36.840]   because of the stress being put on your fat cells, essentially, from overeating. And of
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:41.200]   course, reducing obesity might help that, and that's been tried without drugs, with
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.640]   diet and exercise, and it works. So we replicated those results, and we just read that study
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:52.200]   out with Manjaro, which showed that three years on our drug, 94% fewer new diagnosis
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.880]   of outright diabetes. So that's a huge national health problem, and if we can treat diabetes
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:04.400]   or obesity early in the life, we could potentially reduce diabetes downstream. So there's many
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.960]   examples of these, but we're going for dozens and dozens of these kinds of use cases for
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.120]   the technology.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:14.020]   So when that gets approved, when you go through your clinical trial, you get a positive indication
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:23.220]   on the readout, a doctor can then prescribe that particular drug for that condition, and
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.500]   then what, insurance covers it? I mean, just help us understand kind of how payment happens
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:33.180]   in this, and ultimately, and we'll talk a little bit about pricing in a second.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:40.560]   Yeah. So now we move from clinical experiment and science to the messy part of healthcare.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:49.660]   So in America, I think we have a strong bias to reimburse things that are kind of obvious,
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:56.220]   and when things are new, it's harder. What we see today with whether it be Lilly's products
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:03.140]   in this category or Novo's is really broad acceptance by insurance and healthcare practitioners
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:08.380]   in treating outright diseases like diabetes, type two diabetes, and probably like these
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.540]   cardiovascular conditions we're studying. I think they'll be adopted quickly and reimbursed
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.260]   quickly, but that's when you already have the disease. Of course, the real promise here
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:21.220]   is to prevent those diseases, but in almost every case in this country, we don't really
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.220]   pay for prevention, right? So people who are obese and don't have those conditions, if
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:30.460]   you're, say, on Medicare, currently the rule of the federal government is they won't pay
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:36.420]   for these medications. You have to get diabetes before you can get the drug, which sounds
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:42.400]   pretty stupid, and I think it is, but the evidence needs to build. Our job is to invest
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:47.420]   in that evidence base I just spoke about so that we can show time and time again that
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:52.480]   all these chronic illnesses can be abated, slowed, or even eliminated, and in some cases
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.780]   even reversed if we can get people to lose a dramatic amount of weight safely, which
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:04.080]   is what these drugs do. That's in the process of sort of getting that idea adopted.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:10.360]   Why is that controversial? Because if I'm an actuary underwriting the long-term cost
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:15.160]   of a patient or an individual in a program, an insurance program, I'm going to look at
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.800]   that patient or that person, I'm going to say, "Hey, if they stay overweight, there's
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.960]   going to be four diseases they're going to get over the next 30 years, and I'm going
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.520]   to have to pay for that, but if we can get them to lose the weight, I'm going to save
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:31.760]   all this money. Shouldn't I have a financial incentive, an economic incentive to change
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.180]   that?" What's the controversy there?
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:40.800]   Yeah, I think that's in process. I was actually in a big investor of mine's office a few weeks
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.640]   back and they said, "Oh, the last company in here was a reinsurance company and they're
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:51.080]   changing their actuarial tables for people who are on these drugs," which I was like,
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.520]   "Wow, you know you're making a difference when that's happening," but it hasn't trickled
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.160]   through the system. I think there's a lot of still stigma associated with obesity, frankly,
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.680]   like social stigma, and patients report to us, "A lot of doctors won't even use these
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:11.400]   drugs because they think it's a product of laziness." Why people become obese, we don't
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.560]   really understand completely yet why one person would and one person wouldn't. What we do
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:22.280]   know is once you become overweight or obese, losing that weight as an adult is really difficult.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:27.640]   Some studies show less than 5% of people can reach a healthy body weight on diet and exercise
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.920]   once they're obese. So that's a very ineffective standard of care.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:38.560]   So today, if I want to get trizepatide for weight loss, which I think you guys call ZepBound,
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:45.120]   right? Yeah. So can I go to my health insurance company and have them pay for it or am I paying
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.880]   out of pocket?
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:53.920]   Depends on who you work for, Dave. So right now, about 50% of the employer-sponsored insurance
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:59.840]   plans cover it. Lilly covers it. We cover the Novo ones, too, because we think obesity
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:07.160]   is a disease. Those skew toward companies with money, basically. I think health benefits
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:13.480]   are part of just attracting and retaining employees. So smaller businesses, businesses
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:18.280]   with lower margins like retailers, et cetera, really don't cover these meds yet.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.680]   I think in five years, we'll look back and we'll say, "That was crazy." Once the evidence
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:28.000]   base is built up and there's more adoption and less stigma. But right now, that's the
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.680]   current state. So a lot of people do pay out of pocket and we've got some work to do to
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:40.440]   help them. The rule of the land in the U.S. is if you're in the federal benefit, you can't
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:47.480]   even accept savings cards from the manufacturer. But for those that have a commercial benefit,
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.560]   like if you work at a large employer like a retailer that doesn't cover it, we can actually
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.360]   buy down your out-of-pocket costs, and we do that.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.920]   Did I hear correctly that you guys are doing a direct-to-consumer model as well? Is that
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.920]   right?
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:08.080]   Yeah, yeah. So to get at this very problem of both stigma and cost, back in January,
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.760]   we launched what we call Lilly Direct. So people can go to their doctor or use our telehealth
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.760]   platform. We have a bunch of partners who will see you as a physician and they're obesity
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.520]   specialists and they'll send the prescription to Lilly and we'll fulfill it directly via
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.840]   mail, DTC. This solves two problems. One is people can go to a place where they're not
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.640]   stigmatized for being overweight, and two, they always get it at the same price and it's
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.520]   the lowest price available to them. There's a lot of confusion in retail pharmacy about
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.840]   what people should pay, and there's some pharmacies marking these drugs up because of the supply
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.840]   issues.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.240]   Is it $1,000 a month? Is that right, for curzapatam, curzapatam?
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:52.000]   List price. We have a savings card program that's about $600 per month. And then we also
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   just launched in the lowest two doses, a vial form, which is a little easier for us to make.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.600]   We can get into the supply issues here, maybe in this discussion too. And that's $399, basically,
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:10.000]   and $550 for those two doses. So almost 60% off.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.160]   Still a lot. So what about the criticism and the research that has shown that if you go
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:20.260]   off of one of these drugs, the weight comes back? And as a result, we're kind of going
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:27.080]   from a chronically ill population to a chronically drug-dependent population. How do we address
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:33.640]   that concern? And what is the change that's needed over time for that not to be the case?
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:38.560]   Isn't there an economic incentive for Lilly to always be hoping that more people need
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.720]   the drug more frequently because that's how you guys make money? And how do we kind of
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:46.800]   talk about that change that's coming and whether you need to be on it forever?
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:52.960]   Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, our mission is not what you said. Our mission is to solve human
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.020]   health problems. And ideally, that would be here where people could have a course of therapy
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:04.880]   and then not have to take medicine. The physiology of GOP1 and GIP right now, that's not how
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:10.480]   it works. If you don't have them on board, your body restores itself to its previous
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:17.520]   position. There is a theory that if you sustain low body weight for long enough, you can kind
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:23.680]   of reset your thermostat in a way. And your body will stop trying to defend what it perceives
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:29.040]   as a starvation state, which is you're not carrying as much weight as you normally would.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.440]   But we haven't had these drugs around long enough to prove that out. We also know that
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.440]   some people lose weight and then do change everything about their life to sustain that
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:45.400]   body weight and go off successfully. That's not uncommon, but it's not the most probable
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:50.320]   outcome for most. So for now, we need to take the drugs long term. But we are working on
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:57.880]   drugs in our pipeline that do seek to reset the metabolic switch. And using like the PYY
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.960]   as a mechanism, it's a brain mechanism that's thought that maybe you could have a treatment
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:09.640]   course, lose weight, and then reset your thermostat, if you will, of what your body's supposed
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.960]   to weigh. We're working on this problem.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.480]   Because my understanding is like, your base metabolism drops, so the number of calories
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:23.320]   per day that your body is burning to live goes down. So if you stop taking the drug,
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.780]   and the hunger switch gets slightly turned back on, even if you eat a normally healthy
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.480]   number of calories per day, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500, you start to gain weight again, because
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:37.720]   your metabolism has declined. But what I've heard from a lot of friends, I don't want
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.680]   to call everyone a biohacker, but it definitely seems to be in kind of the people that like
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:47.360]   to mess around and try new things crowd is to kind of go on and off. So people are trying
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.440]   lower doses, they're trying the drug for a period of time, they do it once a month, once
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:56.480]   a week, and then they kind of maintain a healthy weight without needing to be kind of on the
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.440]   typical regular cadence of the drug. Is that something you guys are seeing more frequently
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.200]   that the steady state do you think over time?
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:10.280]   We definitely see that in in in the clinic and in in in practice by people. And you know,
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.440]   back to the cost, of course, people want to spend less money. And if that works for them,
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.280]   you know, there's certainly in its under doctor supervision, we have no problem with that
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.520]   we need to do more studies in the space. You know what you have one drug on here, or not
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:29.040]   on here, which is coming in, it may be the most important drug because of the scale ability,
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.200]   which is it's called or for glupon. It's a, it's a chemical drug. So here, not an amino
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:41.280]   acid, but a organic chemistry that mimics that mimics the activating part of the peptide.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:47.400]   And so it's a, it's an oral glp one, in our hands, it's about as good as as high dose
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:53.080]   as semaglutide. And we're doing phase three right now. So that will start to read out
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:57.760]   next year. The benefit of this is one, it's oral, so it's a little easier to take, you
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.280]   don't have to refrigerate, you don't have to worry about the injection. You know, some
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:05.520]   people don't like to inject. But the real thing is this is a this is a product for the
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:11.200]   masses because the systems we make these, these drugs in now are complicated to scale.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.040]   And that's why there's been shortages, you know, we have approvals in more than 40 countries
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:20.160]   we haven't even launched in. That's not a normal thing for for a company. You can't
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.680]   make enough product. We can't make enough, right? And because we want to satisfy the
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:28.640]   markets we've already launched in. So, or further prawn, which is this phase three project
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:35.160]   is super key in that we could both supply, you know, people who could get away with just
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:41.600]   the one hormone drug glp one. And we're studying it as a maintenance option as well, which
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.800]   makes kind of sense to go through the injection, lose more weight, and then keep it off with
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   something a little easier to take.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.920]   What's your sense on how this is going to affect the food industry? So a lot of analysts
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.400]   have talked about, hey, food companies are going to get damaged by this. I'm going to,
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.920]   I'm an investor in a company called super gut, and we have high resistance starch fiber
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.840]   product that we're now selling and having a lot of success selling as a compliment to
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:10.600]   glp one. So you're on a glp one, or GIP drug, you take this product, and it kind of can
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:14.140]   help you during that period of time. And it's a new category that seems to be growing a
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:18.240]   lot of companies are launching around this similar concept. Now, do you think this is
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.440]   changing the food industry in the United States and in the West and ultimately around the
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:27.000]   world? And I don't know if you talk, do you talk to CEOs of food companies? Do they call
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.520]   you and like, what are you doing to our business?
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:36.320]   Yeah, I've got I've got a couple on my board, even. But so, you know, I, I think there are
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:42.040]   certainly displacing effects of this, this category. And I think it's great news overall,
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:47.360]   first is the health things we talked about. So people need, you know, less diabetes products,
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:52.200]   for sure, they'll need less other medicines. We're doing even doing study in like OA pain
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:58.360]   in the knee, because a lot of knee replacements are in obese people. And they get painful
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:04.120]   early in life, knee pain. And we hope to show you can prolong that. So that's a sort of
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.160]   a knock on effect. And then of course, food to be the next one you think about, I think
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.360]   you might know about the study. But last year, Walmart did this sort of what's in the cart
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:15.960]   study? Yeah, for people on ozempic or Manjaro, and it showed, they were buying about a third
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.920]   less calories. So that's a lot. But that's consistent with how the drugs work. But interesting
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:26.280]   also, fewer salty snack foods. Yes, they're buying more fruits and vegetables, shopping
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:31.200]   at the edge of the store versus the center. So that's happening, probably because we only
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.480]   have 10 or 11 million Americans on these drugs. We're not happening in an economic scale that's
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:42.480]   really changing food companies, bottom lines. But you know, enterprising companies, like
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:47.080]   the one you mentioned, you know, protein shake companies, there's a lot of things happening.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.800]   I went to a quick serve restaurant. It was in California a few weeks back, and they actually
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:58.240]   had a like a GLP one side menu. That's what it's called. Exactly. If you're on these drugs,
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.800]   use these. So you know, it is, it's having a big social footprint.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:09.880]   Yeah. Well, I mean, here's your stock price. So Eli Lilly's stock, I think may outperform.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:15.320]   I don't know, it's probably pretty close. With Nvidia, it's an extraordinary stratospheric
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:20.360]   rise. And then just to look at how the business operates today. So you have this portfolio
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:28.680]   of products that you're developing, but in the last quarter, you did 11 billion in revenue
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:36.320]   and generated 3 billion net profit. I think it's 3.7 of operating profit. One of the key
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.280]   criticisms, and this is one of the things I wanted to get into was, how do you address
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:47.800]   and how do you deal with the political heat associated with your success? So you guys
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.560]   are operating a business that is having an extraordinary impact on people's lives. But
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.760]   you're also making an incredible amount of money. And in this environment today, that
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:03.080]   may be more challenging to deal with than it ever has been certain senators that we
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.640]   shall not name would look at this and say, hey, you're making an 81% gross margin selling
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:12.080]   these products to sick people. How can you justify that? So maybe talk a little bit about
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:19.000]   how you deal with the political environment in the US around the world, as you are successful
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.760]   and are projected to triple the business over the next couple of years here?
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.720]   Yeah, well, it's obviously a top of list issue for me every day. Maybe a couple things there,
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:33.200]   Dave. So I mean, first of all, this is a very long investment cycle business. As we talked
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.640]   about earlier, like we launched the first GLP-1 drug in the world in 2005. And since
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:42.240]   that time, we've been working for, you know, this kind of performance, because we took
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:48.160]   risk against that idea, right, and refined it and work that problem. And that, you know,
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:52.080]   I think that timescale is hard for people to think about. But also, you know, the dollar
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:59.740]   scale of the R&D, this year, we'll spend over $11 billion on R&D, which is a meaningful,
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:05.160]   it's like a nation state scale, like it's more than the country of Germany. So we're
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:10.760]   pushing forward new medicines, based on the revenue of today's medicines. And that virtuous
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:14.880]   cycle is sometimes just hard to articulate. But when you get it right, you can have a
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.740]   big societal impact. So that's the first thing. Secondly, you know, I think the pressure is
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:23.320]   a privilege in a way, it means we made something useful enough that a lot of people need it
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:28.280]   and want it. And now our job is to work with, you know, the healthcare system to sustainably
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:34.480]   adopt it. And we do see that as our responsibility to work with, you know, politicians, if that's
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:40.840]   who we work with, or health plans or employers to find a way to get this medicine, which
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:46.920]   we think is amazing, there's appetite to so many people, and do it in a way that's sustainable.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.600]   Now, hopefully, we've created enough value that certainly the people who are getting
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.920]   the drug are benefiting, that the health plans are actually lowering costs in the long term,
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.400]   even though there may be an increase in the short term, and that we make a reasonable
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:04.840]   profit for our shareholders, and sustain R&D for the future. So I think that's what's happening
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.640]   here. I think this week, actually, Novo Nordisk, our competitor, was called before Congress
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:14.840]   to talk about this issue. There's a lot of other dysfunctions in the US system that we
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:19.320]   could talk about in terms of how inefficient healthcare is. I mean, here's a medicine that
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:26.840]   could augment 100, 200 adult diseases in a meaningful way. It's expensive, yes, probably
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:32.640]   net pricing for us, you know, is going to be something like $3,000, $4,000 a year in
[00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:37.360]   the steady state per person. But I think we'll create more value than that. We'll save the
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:41.800]   system more money than that per year per user. That's what we should be aiming for.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:49.280]   I think what's interesting about it is the biologic products, the molecules are advancing,
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:56.040]   and they're advancing in a pretty kind of steady way. The issue, I think, with insulin,
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:02.320]   and there's obviously been a lot of legislation and regulatory and political scrutiny around
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:08.640]   insulin pricing, is it's the same molecule, and the price has just gone up, right? This
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:13.560]   is the old kind of pharmaceutical companies are bad story is they've got a product that
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.680]   they make for 10 cents, and then they sell it for 10 bucks, then someone says, let's
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:22.000]   charge 100. They're like, okay, let's charge 100. And so it's classified as price gouging.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.440]   In this particular market, you guys are certainly making a healthy market, but the products
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:30.840]   are also advancing. There's new combination therapies coming out and the oral therapy.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.840]   So there's a lot of investment in improving the overall landscape of what's possible.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:40.120]   Yeah, let me address that because I took over in early 17, as you mentioned, and like that,
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:46.280]   the insulin pricing scandal, which Novo and Lilly were also center of, right, was hot
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:52.280]   and heavy. And so I took a lot of personal lessons from that. But, you know, every day
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:57.040]   since that we had reduced the price of insulin, even though, you know, we have this weird
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:04.520]   system in the U S where a lot of our two thirds of actually our gross price goes to PBMs and
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:09.280]   insurance companies. So of the gross price that's often quoted, the net for us is about
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:14.560]   a third of that. And insulin, it was even more, where does that money go? Well, it's
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:19.840]   used often to cross subsidize other things in healthcare. So we have to unwind that system
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.360]   if we really want to value innovation. And then the other thing, which is in this chart
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.960]   is, and I mentioned is some of that revenue from insulin we use to invest in the next
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:32.240]   generation of therapy, whether it be insulins, which we're still investing in new insulins
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:37.720]   or GLP one drugs, which of course we did. And that is hard to articulate in the moment,
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:43.040]   but it actually produces good economic and social value later. Here though, we, we took
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.240]   those lessons. We launched at a 20% discount to Novo's product, even though we have better
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:52.720]   efficacy data and we've only cut the price since then. And I think, um, we see a kind
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:58.160]   of a generational opportunity for the company to both be, have the best product. So efficacy
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:03.760]   and quality, but also mass production. And that requires a pricing strategy consistent
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.920]   with that. Well, you've also invested a lot in manufacturing in the United States, right?
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.720]   Didn't you just do like a $5 billion investment in Indiana to build new facilities?
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:16.080]   Yeah, we're building the largest API site in the history of the United States in Indiana.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.960]   Yeah. So that's, I mean, that's got to feel good to the politicians too, that this isn't
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:25.240]   like, uh, optimizing for costs, but there's also infrastructure being built. So I've got
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:29.680]   a lot of numbers on forecast breakdown of product. I think like what's interesting is
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.760]   just, I don't know if these numbers seem right, but the analysts are projecting that your
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:40.280]   20, 26 operating income numbers could grow to $32 billion. I mean, it's just such an
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:47.280]   incredible rise. And that obviously is the pipeline of indications, the pipeline of combo
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:53.040]   therapies, new modalities. And that's up from 7 billion last year, I believe, right? So
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.600]   a Forex in three years at the scale of operating income, it's really incredible.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.600]   I hope they're right.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:07.960]   Yeah. I mean, good for you. I heard that there was like internal forecasts that I won't reveal
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:13.600]   my source, uh, and all the forecasts got kind of blown out. Like the forecasts were too
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:18.800]   conservative in terms of where you guys are at with terzapatide. So, um, I wouldn't be
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:24.560]   surprised if you did. So if we look, look at the breakdown of Lily's portfolio of revenue
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:32.760]   today, uh, it's very obvious that what we've just been talking about, the GLP one GIP drugs
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.160]   are the vast majority of the portfolio and expected to be the vast contributor of growth
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.960]   in the years ahead. But maybe you can tell me a little bit, tell us a little bit about
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:47.640]   how you think about the portfolio of other opportunities to address disease and how you're
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.800]   investing there and how, you know, when you've got such a blockbuster like this and you've
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.360]   got a runaway train and you can't keep up with demand, how do you dedicate resources
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.360]   to the rest of the portfolio?
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:00.840]   And how do you think about that as a CEO, as a leader in getting your team to focus
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:06.720]   on other things that are also very. Yeah, I think, I mean, that's the key thing we'd
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:11.320]   spend a lot of time with our board on, you know, on the one hand, um, I think there's
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.440]   a lot of business books you could read that say, well, double down on your winners, right?
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:19.720]   And just keep going. But unlike other industries, you know, David, we don't really have a franchise
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:24.560]   value at the end of the patent life right there. When, when drugs go off patent, you
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:31.200]   have to actually have a better drug that competes with almost free. Yeah. And that's probably
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:36.880]   possible one or two times here. We're talking about Monjaro, Tulicity, our last, our GLP
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.720]   one only in semi-glutized GLP one only we'll go generic. And we think we have enough differentiation
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:47.640]   to keep growing through that. But at some point that story runs out, right? And so on
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:52.800]   a timescale of decades, you need other lines in the water. Um, in a lot of ways, this is
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.120]   like an options business. You know, we, we, we have to lay down bets across a variety
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:02.240]   of things. They have to be, you know, real unmet medical needs that you can get paid
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:05.840]   if you have a solution for, but also, you know, the technology bet, is it going to work
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:11.800]   and how to attack that. So my mindset is we have to walk and chew gum at the same time
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:17.640]   here. We have to execute like nobody else against this enormous kind of not, not even
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:23.640]   generational, maybe longer opportunity to build a company, affect human health and return
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:28.720]   capital to shareholders. At the same time, we, Lily's been around 148 years. Um, I think
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:33.880]   we have an obligation to our newest employee just joined to have a business by the time
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:39.000]   they get to a senior level. And we certainly have a role in the world changing human health.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.560]   So we are investing pretty broadly in cancer and immunology, maybe in brain disease is
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:49.320]   the most important area we can invest more in. Um, because I think that's actually becoming
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:55.520]   more tractable and is about 40% of global suffering is some form of a brain or, or,
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:00.920]   um, neuroscience disease. And we have a lot of expertise there. So a little bit of balance
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:06.800]   and a lot of focus simultaneously. And we divide our organization so that we have four
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.620]   business leaders. And one of them is this franchise we were just talking about weight
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:16.060]   loss and cardiometabolic health. Three others have other agendas and their job is to compete
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:23.600]   and win that way. I'm proud that actually in Q2, Q2, our non-Incretin, our non-terzepatide
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:28.800]   business grew 17% on a pretty big base. So that's a healthy business as well. More on
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:34.080]   the scale of a regular pharma company, not the supersized thing we've become.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:38.040]   What science are you excited about? I don't know if you're a big science nerd, um, as
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:44.760]   much, but you had like, so the Incretin products are, um, you know, uh, it's peptide manufacturing,
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:49.120]   but obviously there's, uh, uh, cell therapies. So programming cells to go into the body and
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:55.040]   do things. There's gene therapies where we have all sorts of mechanisms for altering
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.980]   gene expression and making, you know, permanent changes in, in, in human cells. And, um, and
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:05.480]   then there's all this interesting stuff in that, that I'm super fascinated by and excited
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:11.120]   by and like Yamanaka factors, these factors that can have a profound effect on the epigenome,
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:16.760]   uh, which can ultimately change how, how cells behave and radically affect the process of
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:20.520]   aging or what we consider to be aging. What else are you excited about? What's exciting
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:26.220]   in the portfolio and how do you invest internally versus do M&A versus venture to kind of access
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:30.400]   those interesting, you know, areas? Yeah. Well, let me talk about science and I'll get
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:34.080]   to the investment strategy, but we've talked about diseases here, but you know, we think
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:40.240]   about our, our role is like having a palette of ways to make medicines, which are basically,
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:45.160]   you know, new molecular matter against, uh, a set of diseases. We know something about
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:49.520]   that sort of, when those things converge, we do well. So what's in the palette, I think
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:54.760]   that's been expanding rapidly lately. And I think this whole new field of genetic medicine,
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   which you talked about, um, like ex vivo gene therapy where you edit cells and they go do
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:06.760]   things like Cartes or, uh, gene edits themselves or gene inserts, which are exciting. You know,
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:15.240]   we had a medicine where we announced results this year that is focused on inner ear diseases
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:19.800]   of deafness, basically congenital deafness disorders that are monogenic. Um, and we,
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.880]   we've treated patients that have gone from like six, eight years of life, no hearing
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:28.640]   at all to now hearing, I mean, this is, it is Lazarus, like when you see it, but the,
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:32.040]   you know, I think the thing that excites me is when you can do amazing things at massive
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:37.880]   scale. So those two techniques, Carty and gene therapy, it's hard to think of like super
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:43.440]   scaled millions of people benefiting one new family of medicines. I'm excited about it.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:49.740]   The so-called S I R N a, this is where we can knock down proteins that are aberrant
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:57.040]   or causing problems and do it pretty safely and surgically, um, and do it very infrequently.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:02.120]   So like we have a project in phase three right now that knocks down the production of something
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:07.280]   called LP little a, which is a lipoprotein particle. That's probably thought to be about
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:12.520]   25% of the remnant reasons why we still have cardiovascular disease. And there's no medicine
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:19.140]   for it today. This is promises to be a once a year dose. And so you take this once a year
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:23.720]   and it's catalytic and sales and it works and just keeps knocking down this protein.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:28.360]   So if that translates into outcomes, I think that makes for a very scalable business. We
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:34.080]   could treat millions or a billion people with a medicine like that and have a big, big effect.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.920]   So we're playing around with that toolbox, um, extensively these days.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:42.200]   So scale has some scale matters, right? And then, well, that's our stress. I think that's
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.300]   what our Lily's for, right? Is to make things that aren't boutique, but things that are
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:52.440]   everywhere. So, you know, how do we do this? I mean, we, we, we have focused maybe more
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:57.440]   than anyone else on a lot of small deals that starts with our corporate venture group. So
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:03.560]   we have one of the most scaled corporate venture operations and all of corporate America, hundreds
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:08.160]   and hundreds of bets that are small in size. Usually we go in with, you know, with GPs
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:13.600]   as an LP and invest in small biotechs pre, pre, uh, public.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:18.160]   And there we don't have to be so right. Mostly we're trying to learn and follow science and
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:22.320]   have a seat at the board or a seat at the table so that when things start to turn, we
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:29.240]   can move early. Um, we do a lot of M and a last year, you're both an LP in venture funds
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:34.480]   and you write checks direct. Is that right? Yeah. Both ways. Yeah. Okay. We also have
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:39.600]   a interesting project we're growing. I'm quite called catalyze three 60. And here are the
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:44.760]   ideas beyond money. What else can we do to help incubate small companies? And so we have
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:50.120]   both space, but also a service layer we're offering sometimes in a cost plus way, or
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:54.520]   sometimes we're downstream royalties where, you know, we're a big capable company when
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:58.680]   you're building a new company, like you've been doing in, in, um, ag, like sometimes
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:02.480]   you need something that's a pain in the ass to go build, you have to either buy a consultant
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:06.680]   or hire one person and you only need them for a few, few months.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.520]   So here we're stepping in and say, well, we'll give you that console. If you need to interpret
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:14.400]   a tax results, like you can just call Lily's experts. So we're like a service layer to
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:19.960]   cultivate kind of this ecosystem around us. And then we do M and a, we buy companies last
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:24.520]   year, about two dozen, which was the most of any pharma company, but actually with some
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:30.680]   of the least capital deployed. So we're making, um, I think we spent $3 billion on 24 companies.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:35.880]   So we're making lots of small bets. Right. And I think that is interesting because the
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:41.160]   longer we have, uh, residents, you know, sort of, uh, in a partnership or we own something,
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:47.360]   we can add more value. It also allows us to trade in front of the de-risking event. When
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:52.080]   things get de-risked in our sector, there's a huge inflection in value. And so you're
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:56.920]   basically paying the last shareholders, not yourself. Um, we think we can bet better than
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:02.840]   the market on what those, the probability of something converting to, to a success is.
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:06.080]   And if we're right about that, we'll, we'll be better off buying early.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:11.440]   Yeah. Well, so as a lot is changing at the company and you're, you're at the scale you're
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:16.440]   at and growing as fast as you are, how do you think about, and this was an important
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:20.400]   one, I wanted to talk about leadership and culture. I've, uh, uh, someone that works
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:25.400]   with me at Ohalo, uh, her name's Megan. She worked at, at Lily for years. And so we had
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:28.880]   a long chat about this interview a few days ago and she talked to me about how great the
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:33.360]   culture is and 10,000 people on campus in Indianapolis. And it feels like a college
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.160]   campus. There's a track and field, there's a bar on campus, all these sorts of things
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:40.760]   that make it a great place to work. And she was really torn by the way and making a choice
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:46.400]   to go back to Lily or joining me. So I apologize that we, that we took her. But, um, uh, but,
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.680]   um, maybe tell me a little bit about how you kind of think about culture, keeping people
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:55.400]   aligned, motivated, keep the performance culture strong as you're kind of trying to execute
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:57:01.160]   at this extraordinary scale. Yeah. Exceptional question. I mean, that's of the things I worry
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:04.640]   about longterm. This is one of them. How do we keep what's so good about how we operate?
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:09.200]   I mean, the background of the company is important. It's an old company, right? And it was family
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:14.160]   run for a hundred years. Like it was one of the few exceptions in corporate America where
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:18.720]   the third generation didn't totally screw it up. Actually, they made it quite a bit,
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:24.720]   quite a bit better. Um, and because of that, I think there's a lot of loyalty and social
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:29.420]   cohesion in a company. As you mentioned, like we'd like coming to work and being together.
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:34.000]   It's a friendly place, but also scientifically super rigorous. Um, and that's, uh, that's
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.680]   often not two things that fly well together. So I think it's got a lot of exceptional attributes.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:43.000]   When I started though, I think in my kind of view of like, when you're running a big
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:49.240]   ship like this, probably changing the culture is like beyond your, your capability. But
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:53.820]   what you can do is like extent, turn up the things that are good and turn down the things
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:58.080]   that are less good. And we've been cultivating that. So like one thing that was less good,
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:03.800]   but is now really clicking for us is sort of like use our scale or enterprise wide capability
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:09.680]   as a, as a benefit, not a, not a detractor. So many companies get big and get bureaucratic
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:14.400]   and terrible. Like, I mean, they just can't get out of their own way. Totally. And we
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:19.520]   really lean into, okay, it's everyone's job to solve for Lily first. It's everyone's job
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:23.960]   to get the patient healthy. Now let's talk about our departments as a derivative of that,
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:28.160]   not the main goal. And somehow those things get flipped around in big companies and people
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:33.400]   focus on how they look or who's, which department's best. And none of that matters. And we have
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:38.720]   to emphasize that. Another thing I've really focused on is speed at scale. And we measure
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:43.480]   that rigorously. That's more of an engineering thing. I mean, we really track things very
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:47.780]   carefully on speed and we've moved the drug development timeline, which the industry is
[00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:54.180]   about nine years from first human dose to FDA approval. And when I started ours was
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:59.720]   about 11 and now we're 6.1. So how did you, how did you, how did you incentivize that?
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:04.280]   How did you reward that and create the model for individuals to contribute to that goal?
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:08.560]   Yeah. Kind of one big idea. And then a thousand little things. The big idea is like this ratchet
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:15.840]   mindset that every time we beat a timeline, that becomes the new norm. And so we like
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:20.480]   to just re benchmark internally. And when we were at 11 and it was as at nine, everyone
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:24.280]   wants to jump to be, okay, let's be industry average, but that's actually quite hard in
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:28.680]   a big company. So we just said, okay, if it, we have a submission document to get in and
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:32.600]   it used to be our standard was 120 days from when you had the data to when you send it
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:38.240]   to the FDA. We're now doing that routinely inside of two weeks. So we've basically taken
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:43.920]   80% of the time out, but that came in lots of little bites, but overarching everyone
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:47.680]   who works in development knows it's about time to patient. That's the, that's the big
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:53.320]   idea solve for that. So yeah, that's, you know, those are some of the kind of culture
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:57.160]   dynamics we, we deal with. And of course we want to attract new people. We've expanded
[00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.800]   dramatically on the coast. Our science operations, like if you go, you know, South San Francisco
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:06.520]   is now pretty big campus for us. We just built a huge building in Seaport, Boston that'll
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:13.080]   hold 500 genetic scientists. So for some domains, we need to go where the people are, um, and
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:17.840]   be a more of a kind of a mothership with satellites versus having everyone here in Indianapolis.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.440]   And do you, and I know we got to wrap in a minute, but, and do you worry about AI? There's
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:26.080]   a lot of startups with very smart people that have built, uh, LLMs and other models that
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:31.920]   are now trying to apply those learnings and develop new systems for discovery of molecules
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:37.000]   that will have some particular action and doing it all in silico rather than searching
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.440]   through the domain space of molecules that we're either synthesizing or we're discovering
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:45.320]   in nature. And is that a partnership for you at Lilly? Because you guys can operate at
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:50.800]   scale and manufacture and distribute and market, or is that a disruptive force that could really
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.200]   damage the 20 year out kind of horizon for Lilly's business? How much do you really think
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.800]   or worry about this? Oh, we spent a lot of time on this. You know, of course we have
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:05.600]   our own efforts, um, pretty significant AI efforts internally and a lot of partnerships,
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.640]   including with, you know, open AI and Microsoft, Amazon, et cetera. Um, all basically all the,
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:18.040]   the large scale players, Google isomorphic. So we have to pay a lot of attention to it.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.960]   Here's what I noticed so far is there's a lot of money. I think last year, 5 billion
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:27.040]   with a B went into new venture backed tech bios, you know, that's what they like to call
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:33.080]   themselves. And that money is coming not so much from the traditional bio VC world, but
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.520]   from the tech world, which is people got a lot more, a lot more to splash around. Right.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.920]   That's right. But a lot of those, I think if you look at their, their pitch decks, they're
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:47.160]   really saying, Oh, we're going to invent, we're going to run the whole process in silico.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:53.680]   And I think that's really naive actually. Um, and what I think will end up in the medium
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.400]   term being very valuable is more of the tool builder approach. Like we can take a process
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:02.760]   like add me. So that's where you're trying to optimize chemical properties of a drug.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:07.160]   Like we're talking about GOP one. So it's not twice a day, it's once a week. And there,
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.400]   I think by chunking problems smaller, the machines can really help a lot more. We have
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:18.320]   more data on some specific acute use cases, and we can have a tighter loop between the
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:25.120]   experiment in the, on the bench and the data process behind the, the model learning, the
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.080]   idea that you're going to throw on, you know, turn a switch on a computer, and it's going
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.400]   to think about something and invent, you know, the next Prozac. I don't know. I think we're
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.720]   a long way from that day, but we'll, we're paying attention to all of it.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.360]   Yeah. So wet lab and clinic integration is critical. It's not all going to be in silico.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:45.560]   There's going to be a good chunk of the time. Yeah. It's a copilot model where the machine
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:50.360]   can do predictions. Probably now where we see the most value is eliminating bad ideas
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:54.880]   that humans don't see, but in hindsight look obvious. So like, cause you can integrate
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:59.720]   a lot of multi source data and say the probability of this working based on prior experiments
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:04.720]   is like 2%. Yeah. And there's human factors where scientists like their, their last idea
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:10.240]   the most, but also we have trouble seeing across all this field domains of data. Machines
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.240]   are good at that. That that can add value immediately. Awesome. Well, are you glad you
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.280]   took the job seven and a half years ago or what are you most happy about? And what's
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:24.240]   the biggest disappointment? Last, last question here. Do we wrap up? Yeah, of course. I mean,
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.600]   what an honor to be in a company like this at this moment. We all need to get better
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:34.560]   all the time. I mean, I, I find myself disappointed mostly by, but not being prepared, not thinking
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:41.840]   in advance of, of things, but you know, it's, um, when you become a kind of a, yeah, that
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.960]   looks obvious in hindsight, which we all have. It's a complicated business. You know, I should
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:50.920]   give myself grace on it, but it happens more often than I would hope. And I, I think that
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:55.120]   staying humble about that is like one of the most important things that successful CEOs
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.200]   can do. I mean, you always have to learn and you always have to learn from your own mistakes.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.480]   That's something we talk about a lot here. I, you know, I think it's, it's cool that
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:09.200]   we've become more of a cultural icon. That's cool. But it's also a big responsibility because
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:14.320]   like you said, with the Lily direct and, you know, being more of a consumer household name,
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:19.320]   people expect a lot more of us. And we've got to change from being just like a Midwestern
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:24.480]   quiet medicine company to something a lot more. And we're not there yet. We have to,
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.920]   we have to get better. So yeah, yeah. More to do no. Great. Well, thanks so much for
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.600]   taking the time to chat with me today, Dave. It's been an honor and a pleasure. And I wish
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.040]   you the best of luck with Lily. Congrats on, on all the success. Thanks a lot. We'll have
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.440]   to have you come out to our lab sometime. I will. Yeah, no, I'm, uh, next time I'm in
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.920]   the Midwest, I will certainly take you up on that. I'd love to come visit. It'd be awesome.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.440]   Awesome.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:50.440]   [inaudible].
