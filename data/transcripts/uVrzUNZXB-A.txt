[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   A lot of people who are trying to save money on medical travel are ashamed to talk to their
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.520]   specialist or they don't want to let them know that they're traveling.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.920]   It's really important to give your doctor a heads up.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.280]   And there's no shame in saying, "Doc, I can't afford you.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.380]   And I found a great clinic, it's JCI accredited.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.720]   This is where I want to go."
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.200]   It may or may not be that your doctor and your destination and your foreign country
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.200]   would follow up.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.360]   But the fact that you've given your doc notice and you brought back all of your paperwork,
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.800]   that's another big mistake people make is they toss their paperwork, they leave it in
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800]   the hotel room.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.280]   You got to bring back your screening, your blood tests, your consultation notes, all
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.280]   of that.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.960]   And then a doc is going to be able to pick up where your other doc left off if a complication
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.840]   develops or if they need to go in and do something else or have some follow up.
