[00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.800]   So as most of you probably know, I am not a heavy phone user. I do own a smartphone,
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.320]   but I don't use any social media. So my phone just isn't that interesting to me. When I work,
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.400]   I time block my day. So the idea of just casually looking at my phone for distraction is also
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.600]   something that I'm just not that used to. That was until last week. A couple of things happened
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.280]   at the same time. First, I got sick. So I was home sick for about a week. You might still hear it in
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.920]   my voice today. So I found myself without much to do. I was off and bored and my phone was there.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.720]   And suddenly I was looking at that thing much more than I normally would.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:50.240]   Then, piling on, we had Hurricane Helene here in the States, which caused the disastrous flooding
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.400]   in Asheville. Well, I have a good friend in Asheville. And so I was really plugged in
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.240]   following the news, trying to piece together from various online sources, minute by minute,
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.280]   what was going on up there. And that also got me looking at my phone even more.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.120]   So there was this period, it was less than a week, but it was a period in which I was constantly
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.560]   using my phone. It punctuated everything that was going on in my life. And I'll tell you,
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.040]   here's my review of that period. It was terrible. But the scary thing is, I think this is how a lot
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.000]   of people live basically all the time, with that phone just sort of always there, never that far
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.680]   away from their life. This concerns me based on my experience. So what I want to talk about today
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:41.440]   is what happens. Let's define and explore what happens when your phone plays a constant presence
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.920]   in your life. And then let's get to some solutions, what you could do if you want to get away from
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.240]   that. All right. So let's start with trying to explain what it is that happens when you use
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.720]   their phone that much. A statistic here I think is helpful. How often do we check our phones?
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.400]   According to one survey I found from reviews.org, which is roughly in line with other data I've
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.480]   seen, Americans now check their phone an average of 144 times a day. We're also spending an average
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:15.200]   of four hours and 25 minutes total each day on our phone. That latter statistic is up 30% from
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.440]   last year. If you do the math on 144 minutes of checks, rather, of your phone per day and assume
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.920]   roughly a 16-hour waking day, that's checking your phone roughly every 6.7 minutes is what that
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.280]   averages out to. This means the average American has the networked digital world essentially never
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.160]   far from their attention. It is a constant cognitive presence. I'm going to give a name
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.520]   to this state for the sake of our discussion today. Let's call it continuous partial participation
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.840]   in the networked digital. Most people, or at least a lot of people right now,
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.400]   exist in a state of this continuous partial participation in the networked digital. That's
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   what I experienced last week. That's what I felt was terrible. Let's try to understand what goes
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:14.160]   wrong in this particular state. The first problem has to do with brain fog. I noticed this in my own
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:22.720]   experiments with continuous partial participation is that it was as if I was experiencing the actual
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.320]   world around me through a fog. I mean, I could see what was going on. I was having conversations
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.080]   with people. I knew where I was, but it was like you turned down the resolution on the video camera.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.880]   The colors weren't so bright. The details of what was going on was not so bright. You were there,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.560]   but only sort of kind of there, like you were remembering being there, not actually being
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.960]   in the physical situation that surrounded you. Now, this makes sense if we think about that
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.120]   statistic we looked at. When you're in this state of continuous partial participation in the network
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:01.200]   digital, you are never far from being exposed to this networked online world. There's a lot
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.680]   of information you've encountered, information that requires processing, especially since it's
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.840]   often highly salient information. Your brain is dedicating resources to processing and making
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.440]   sense of what you last saw when you looked at your phone. You put your phone away, your brain doesn't
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.360]   just snap and focus on the new thing you're doing. It's still trying to make sense of what it just
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.160]   encountered. You don't have 100% of the normal cognitive resources that would be dedicated to
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.880]   the world around you right now at your disposal. A non-trivial portion is still trying to process
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.240]   the digital world. Now, this is fine if you transition from the digital world somewhat
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.960]   permanently to the real world. Okay, I'm done watching this movie, and maybe for 10 minutes,
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.120]   I'm not completely present because my mind's making sense of the ending. But after about 10
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.360]   or 15 minutes, now you're present. When you're checking your phone every once every 6.7 minutes,
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.400]   you never actually get that freedom. So you see the world as if through a fog when your mind is
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.480]   never that far from encountering the network digital. The second problem has to do with your
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.080]   perception of the world itself, the way you understand the world and what's going on.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.880]   I want to read a quote here. It's a little lengthy, but I think it's a good one. It's
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.040]   a quote from an important book that came out in 2009. This book was written by the science writer
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.320]   Winifred Gallagher, and it was called "Wrapped," R-A-P-T, with the subtitle "Attention and the
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.160]   Focus Life." I talk about it. If this sounds familiar, it's because it was influential to me,
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.960]   and I quote it somewhat extensively in my 2016 book, "Deep Work." All right, so let me quote
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   Winifred Gallagher here. "That your experience largely depends on the material objects and
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.800]   mental subjects that you choose to pay attention to or ignore is not an imaginative notion but a
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.120]   physiological fact. When you focus on a stop sign or a sonnet, a waft of perfume or a stock market
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.640]   tip, your brain registers that target which enables it to affect your behavior. In contrast,
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.000]   the things that you don't attend to in a sense don't exist, at least for you. All day long,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.480]   you are selectively paying attention to something, and much more often than you may suspect,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.120]   you can take charge of this process to good effect. Indeed, your ability to focus on this
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.000]   and suppress that is the key to controlling your experience and, ultimately, your well-being."
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.640]   So what Gallagher is saying here, and she summarizes it this way elsewhere in the book,
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.880]   your world is what you pay attention to. We tell ourselves this myth that there's just like an
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.720]   objective world around us that we see through our senses. It's not really what we are experiencing.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:44.160]   We are experiencing a mental construction of the world inside our brains, and some of it is visual
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.920]   and some of it is auditory, and some of it has to do with what you smell, but some of it has to do
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.560]   with how you feel, and some of it has to do with like what it is particularly that you're focusing
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.680]   on. So your world, your perception of the world, is shaped by what you pay attention to. So what
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:07.120]   happens when we have this continuous partial participation in the online? Well, we are spending
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.400]   a non-trivial amount of our attention targeting at things that are highly emotionally salient.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.200]   They're pushing buttons that makes it something we want to look at on our phone, and that could be
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.960]   fear. That could be outrage. That could be an emotional charge. It could be a sort of constant
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.280]   exposure to epicness, right? It's the surfer on the biggest wave. It's like the violent crime that
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:36.480]   is super violent, right? Things are exaggerated past scale online. It's also a world of deep
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.160]   cynicism, a world in which people are cutting each other and trying to take each other down and
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:49.760]   carefully looking for taboo violations or trying to police their own. This is a world that's not
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:57.120]   so pleasant. It is a world that is a mix of sort of Red Bull, MTV, and Orwell. And if you're looking
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:04.000]   at this network digital once every 6.7 minutes, the construction of the world that exists in your
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.560]   mind is going to overlap heavily with this amalgam of MTV, Red Bull, and Orwell. And your perception
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.400]   of yourself and the life that you lead in the world that is surrounding you is going to be
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:22.000]   dark. It's going to be exhausted. It's going to be strained out. It's going to be upset. It's
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.360]   going to be in a defensive crouch. It literally makes your world worse. What you pay attention
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.880]   to constructs your world, and we're paying attention to things that construct worlds
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:36.960]   that we don't actually like spending time in. I had a memory, a really strong sense memory,
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.600]   when I was thinking about this portion of this deep dive discussion. I don't know why I remember
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:48.960]   this, but it was a random day from my 20s, right? This would have been the 2000s. It was a random
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.000]   day when I was a doctoral student at MIT, because I remember being in the office. So this would have
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.320]   been like 2006 or 2007. And for whatever reason, I got this like really clear memory of that day.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.520]   And what I remembered was, this was pre-smartphones. I mean, I don't use social
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.120]   media, but even if I wanted to back then, they didn't exist. I mean, Facebook was around,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.000]   but I didn't have a phone and I didn't use anything. I have this memory of what a day
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.280]   was like back then. I remember on my way to the status center at MIT where my office was,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.120]   stopping at the Au Bon Pain on, I think it was Main Street, as you went from the Kindle
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.080]   subway station on your way to Vassar Street and ultimately to the status center, and getting an
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.640]   egg sandwich, just being like, "This is great. I like the egg sandwich here. Isn't it great just
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.800]   to eat an egg sandwich?" I remember being in my office and I was probably working on a paper,
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.920]   giving that attention, and then working on a blog post. Back in that day, I was blogging
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.840]   three days a week. So I probably wrote a blog post. And what I remember about that day,
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.880]   it was sunny. It was April. I know this because it was Marathon Day. And I was like, "It's great.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:59.520]   It's sunny in Boston. The spring is coming." And I left early and I went down to watch the marathon
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.480]   and I had the Red Sox game, which they play early on the day of the marathon. I had it on. I had
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.960]   one of these little radios you could plug in. I was listening to the Red Sox game and it was sunny
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.960]   and I was enjoying the sun. And I remember being like, "This is nice. And it's just nice that it's
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.240]   sunny and spring is great. Isn't it great? It's going to be warmer more and baseball season has
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.000]   started. I'm excited about that." And I was probably looking forward to like, "Hey, we got
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.960]   this Netflix DVD in the mail. I'm excited to watch." And maybe my wife and I were going to go
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.080]   to the farmer's market to get something for dinner. And it was just pleasant. It was just paying
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.320]   attention to what you were doing, appreciating what was nice about the day, looking forward to
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.920]   some things that were coming up. The world my mind created that day was a really nice world to be in.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.760]   And it would have been very different if I had a phone and I was on social media and I was just
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.400]   constantly checking in on things. And because I would have had one foot in the digital world that
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:58.000]   wasn't nearly as pleasant as just wandering over. I went to the Federal Plaza, I remember,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.480]   and there was a food truck. My doctoral advisor's son had a food truck and I got
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.720]   some food from the food truck and was walking over to watch the mayor. And I was like, "Oh,
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.800]   great. Just paying attention to the moment." It would have been so different if I had been in a
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.400]   state of continuous partial participation in the network digital. This is what Winifred Gallagher
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.440]   gets into in that book, Wrap. The motivation for that book about attention is a cancer diagnosis.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.560]   And she learns that by paying attention to things that matter to her and to the positive,
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:33.680]   she was able to construct a world that was pretty sunny, even as she was going through,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.640]   objectively speaking, some darker things. So it matters what world you're exposed to.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.320]   Hey, it's Cal. I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video,
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:50.320]   then you need to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:57.680]   Without Burnout. This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:05.600]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow. I know you're going to like it. Check it out.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:12.880]   Now let's get back to the video. All right. The third problem is lack of quiet, right?
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:21.280]   It is in the long pauses in life when nothing much is happening that your mind slows down and quiets
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.560]   and real insight can be had. The Catholics have a good term for this process. They call it
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:33.760]   discernment, right? So they discuss this in terms of turning your intention interior to try to
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:40.960]   understand the sort of will of God. But it's a concept that secularizes nicely, that it's when
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:46.960]   you are quiet and turned inward, it's you alone with your thoughts and looking at the world
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.720]   around you, that some of your most profound insights come when some of the sharpest clarity
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.920]   is identified, where you realize, here's where I am. Here's what matters to me. Here's what doesn't.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.920]   Here's the path I want to be on. Here's how I have left that path, but how I might actually get back.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:09.440]   This really maybe difficult thing has happened to me. This is where I process that. I make sense of
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:18.240]   that and I get resilient growth out of it. The quiet, cognitive quiet is so critical to a life
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.880]   that's not just rich and fulfilling, but a life that you can continually aim back towards meaning
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:29.360]   and depth. Obviously, if you exist in a state of a continuous partial participation in the network
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.640]   digital, you don't get that quiet. Because why do you tolerate that quiet when there is
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:42.160]   the perfectly distracting TikTok video just a second away? Pull that out, hit that button,
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.920]   and you'll be sort of taken away. And I got to say, my experience of living this way last week
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:56.320]   was it's not like these distractions are fantastic, right? The allure to your screen,
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.720]   that drive to go back to your screen, is stronger than the reward you actually get.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:07.200]   I actually found the actual looking at the phone and the scrolling to be numbing in a sort of weird,
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.040]   kind of unsettling way. You felt just sort of vaguely uneasy and like the edges had been rounded
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.400]   off of your emotions, positive and negative. It's not like you're getting something wonderful,
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.400]   you're numbing yourself with it. That was my experience of it. So the quiet is actually where
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:29.200]   so much of life is actually figured out. All right, so if we don't want to exist in this
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.080]   state, what can we do? I'm going to give six ideas. You've heard some of these before, but
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.080]   let's just put them one after another. How do you escape a state of continuous partial participation
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.120]   in the network digital? One, make your phone less interesting. Take the social media apps off your
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.080]   phone. Stop using the social media if it's not vital to you. If it is vital to you, use it on
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:54.640]   your computer. Don't have it on your phone. Don't put games on your phone. Don't put the YouTube app
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:01.200]   on your phone. Make your phone less interesting. Your phone should now be dedicated towards
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:10.160]   phone calls, text messages, information like maps, and audio content. Remember the original vision of
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.600]   the iPhone that Steve Jobs laid out when he first introduced it in 2007 is that we made a really
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.640]   useful phone and we combined it with your iPod so you don't have to carry two. That's a great vision.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.920]   I can scroll through my voicemail instead of having to dial into a voicemail system. I can
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.760]   listen to podcasts and music really well. If I need to look up something, there's a map.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:39.600]   Three, treat your workspace like it's a phone-free school. There's this big push going on right now.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:45.280]   We should talk about this in another episode, but a big push that I'm a fan of towards phone-free
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.720]   schools. Don't have your phone out in the classroom, but have it out in the hallway or at
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:56.960]   lunch, but the model of your phone goes away when you walk in the door and you don't get it again
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.920]   until you walk back out. We just have too much research in the context of phones that this is
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:09.200]   so much better when the mind of the kids can focus completely on what's happening in school and the
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.040]   people around them and not being distracted by the phone and knowing that they're going to see
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.120]   that phone soon and they want to see what's going on. We know it's a much better experience. Well,
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.720]   this holds for adults as well. Kids might be a little bit more susceptible to the distractions
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:28.160]   or the impact of these distractions, but it holds for adults as well. So treat your workplace like
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.200]   you're working in a phone-free school. And the way you do that is you put on a custom do not
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.240]   disturb mode on your phone that blocks everything but phone calls. You tell the people who are
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.640]   important to you in your life, if there's an emergency, call me. And they will if there's
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:47.920]   emergency, which won't really happen, so they'll rarely call. But you don't have to worry that if
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.840]   your kid's sick at school or something that you're not going to find out about it because the calls
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:58.400]   come through. Put your ringer on and put that phone in your bag. And just I don't use my phone
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.360]   while I'm working. Again, if there's a call, I'll hear it, but I don't use text messaging. I don't
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:09.120]   go on social media. It's a phone-free school simulated in my workplace. Now, if there's like
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.000]   messages you want to check in on, maybe you're trying to organize something, great. You can
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.520]   schedule time for that. Over my lunch break, I'm going to take out my phone, catch up with people
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.880]   on text. And what am I going to say at the end of those conversations? All right, I'm about to put
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.160]   my phone away for the rest of the day. But this is where we're leaving this. And we can check back
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.400]   in after. In fact, this would be a good time to say, I'll be leaving around five. It's a half-hour
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.560]   commute. So feel free to call me then too, if we really want to work it out. Just set expectations.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.560]   I'm putting my phone back away. People will learn in about a week or so that you're not on text
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.760]   continuously during the day, that you'll check it midday, and you're accessible after the workday.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:49.600]   They adjust to it. All right, four, treat online content browsing like you would watching television
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:59.040]   shows. Remember how it was in 2009? It was, I am excited to watch this episode of this show tonight,
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:05.120]   and I'm going to go watch that. The office is on right before Parks and Recreation on NBC on
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.480]   Thursday. It'll be great. We're going to get dinner ready, and we're going to watch those shows.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:15.280]   That's very different than I'm going to watch clips of this episode spontaneously and randomly
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.240]   all throughout my day, no matter what else is going on, right?
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:24.880]   It's different. You should make your online entertainment more like TV shows in 2009.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:30.000]   I'm going to put aside a half-hour, an hour. I'm going to load up my laptop, and there's a lot of
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.160]   sites I want to check. I want to get all of the online chatter about the baseball team I'm
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:42.720]   following. I follow these Instagram influencers that are fun or aspirational. I want to check in
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.080]   on all of them and see what's going on, what videos they've posted. I'm going to go down
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.920]   some rabbit holes of links, and I'm going to have some fun, and I'm going to do it from seven to
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:56.960]   eight. You can consolidate the experience of entertainment online and not make it something
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.240]   that you just have in the background as a constant thing you turn to throughout the day.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.160]   All right, now here's the last two ideas, a little more non-digital.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:16.320]   Five, actively practice presence and gratitude. Create an experience that you're going to enjoy.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:22.720]   Look forward to the experience. When you're in it, force yourself to actually sit there and think
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.000]   and say, "This is great. I'm really liking this." When you're done, be like, "That was great."
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:34.000]   You know, like, "I am going to go for a walk in the woods after I do a shutdown, and I'm going to
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.640]   like bring my favorite tea with me, and I'm going to go and journal on this rock, and I'm going to
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.640]   look forward to the walk. I'm going to enjoy it while I'm doing it. I'm going to have some moments.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.200]   Like, isn't this great?" It's just retraining your brain to pay attention to the moment and enjoy
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.320]   what's happening in the moment. I was much better at this back in those grad school days I was
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.240]   talking about, and it made a big difference. And finally, go analog in your activities.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.760]   Journaling helps. It could be the structured journaling we talked about in an early episode.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.080]   It could be you working through like a particular issue. It's analog, and it's interior,
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:12.400]   and there's no digital distraction. Read real books. Reading is great. It slows everything down
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.160]   because after five or 10 minutes, your brain is fully committed to constructing the world on your
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:22.640]   page, and it gets you out of that sort of brain fog, partial attention type existence. Read more
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:28.400]   and spend more time outside. Go for walks. Go for long walks. Go for runs. Go for rows, whatever it
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:34.240]   is. Analog experience. Heighten notable analog experiences where you get used to yourself,
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.240]   your interior, and paying attention to the world around you. All right, so there we go.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:47.440]   I did not enjoy being in the continuous partial attention, given continuous partial attention
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.960]   towards the networked digital. I don't think you should be in that state either. You don't have to
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:21:01.120]   be in that state. It's not worth it unless you have a lot of stock and meta or a bite dance,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:07.840]   some sort of steak and bite dance. That's who makes TikTok. If you don't, you don't need this
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.760]   in your life. That's what I'm saying. Reduce the footprint of your phone. Give yourself full
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.520]   attention to what you're doing, either all digital or you're all in the real world. Hopefully, those
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:21.040]   ideas will happen. Jesse, I was not a happy man. I was depressed. >>What were you scrolling?
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:29.920]   >>So for the Asheville News, I was finding a lot of stuff on Twitter. >>Oh, so you have Twitter
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:35.840]   on your phone? >>Browser. I don't have an app. >>Oh, okay. >>Is there an app? >>For Twitter?
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:41.120]   >>Yeah. >>Yeah, there is. >>Is that a dumb question? >>Yeah. >>Yeah. No, Twitter. So
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.440]   for most of the accounts, the issue is I have these burner accounts for doing journalism,
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:54.000]   right? Because you can't look at them without. So I have this longstanding burner account on
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.360]   Twitter that allows you, so you can go and look at, but for me, it's like going to individual
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.160]   people's things in the browser and then looking at their feed. So I don't have, because I don't
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.880]   use Twitter, I don't have a thing where, I don't have a feed. I don't have a timeline. >>Got it.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.480]   >>Is that the word, right? Where it puts things into it from people you follow and stuff. I don't
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.960]   follow people. I don't have a timeline, but I go to individuals, right? So what I was doing was I
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:22.240]   would find, okay, here's someone who's on the ground there who has some cellular access, and
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.280]   then let me see what they're saying. Also a lot of stuff, news and web. Like, okay, there's an update
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.880]   on the city of Asheville, local news. So local news would post clips and updates, what they were
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.400]   seeing, what was going on. So it was like a lot of consolidating news. It actually served a purpose.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:45.520]   Like I eventually found, so my friend got out of there, but it's not easy to get out of there.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:52.240]   Almost all the roads were destroyed, right? Asheville's up in the mountains, right? Everything
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:59.280]   was flooded. But it's like, how do you get out of there? I found on Reddit, someone on Reddit
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.120]   had posted, I was Google searching, someone on Reddit had posted, okay, we made it out.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.200]   I-26 is open south of Asheville, the only interstate open in all the four cardinal directions.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:15.280]   But to get there, you have to detour. It's closed in Asheville. So here is this like very specific
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.880]   detour on back roads that will eventually get you to I-26, far enough south that you're below the
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:26.000]   flooding. And then you can get from there to 74 to 80, whatever, and get to Charlotte. So like,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.640]   actually all that searching got an escape plan. - For your friend?
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.560]   - Yeah. - So you provided it to him?
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.480]   - Yeah, he got out. - Did he buy the map?
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.240]   - Yeah, it worked. - Oh, you saved him.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:41.920]   - It's still the only way out of Asheville right now. It's a bad situation. But man, it's stressful.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:47.520]   I mean, there's so many stressful things going on in the world that you could constantly be in that
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:55.200]   state. Like we're recording this the day after Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.920]   All right, there's something else you could do this all day long on. I bet tomorrow there'll be
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.760]   something else. There is a vice presidential debate. Okay, like you could probably rabbit
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:10.160]   hole that for two days. I mean, you could really be in a state of like continual emergency.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:16.240]   And that networked world is not a nice world. All right, anyways, so now I'm done with that
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:22.400]   stuff and I'm great. So glad to be back, back more analog. All right, we got a good questions
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:29.520]   we want to get to. But first, let's hear from a sponsor. This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:38.000]   Look, I was just talking about in the deep dive, the stress and anxiety and mental impact of
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.920]   everything you see online. That is a good reminder that the most important relationship you have is
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:50.640]   the relationship with your own brain. And if that relationship is strained, you need to fix that.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.880]   And one of the best ways to fix that relationship is with professional therapy.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.920]   Now, the problem with therapy is it can be hard from a logistical standpoint to find someone. Who
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:04.560]   am I going to talk to? Do they take new patients? What if I don't like them? This is where BetterHelp
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:11.440]   enters the scene. If you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try. It's entirely
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.320]   online. It's designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule. You just fill out a
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.400]   brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist, and then you can switch therapist
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:29.280]   at any time for no additional charge. So get a better relationship with your brain

[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.640]   ZocDoc. There are some things in life that are okay to be a total crapshoot, right? Like trying
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:59.360]   a different type of coffee or a new workout class or, God forbid, a new type of daily planner.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:07.040]   But finding the right doctor should not be a crapshoot. And with ZocDoc, it won't be because
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:13.760]   you've got more options than you know. Now, ZocDoc is a free app and website where you can search

[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:18.800]   .com/deep, ZocDoc.com/deep. All right. And with that, let's move on to some questions.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.680]   Who do we got first, Jesse? First question is from Trevor.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:28.480]   I run a small business and have two managers that are disorganized. They always prioritize
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:33.760]   the urgent over the important. They love to talk about stress and overwork. What can we do to
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:40.400]   better evangelize the deep life? Well, I'm trying to decide if this is the right terminology to use
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:46.240]   here or not, right? So when we talk about the deep life, we're talking about the intentional
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.360]   construction of a life that focuses on the things that matter to you and minimizes the things that
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:28:01.600]   don't. So a bad job can get in the way of realizing a deep life. But what you're evangelizing to your
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:07.920]   bosses is not the deep life, but just having a sane way of actually working. They don't need
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:15.600]   to know about the deep life, but they do need to know about administrative overhead and the
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:21.440]   context switching. That when you have too many things on your plate, more and more of your time
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:27.760]   is dedicated to the servicing of those obligations as opposed to actually finishing things themselves.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.960]   So the rate at which you actually complete useful work goes down. It is not a linear
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.720]   function that the more stuff I push on my employees, the more stuff that will get done.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.280]   That's not actually the way it works. And they need to know about the cost of having to jump
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.240]   back and forth your attention between different targets, like happens when you have bosses that
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.120]   demand instant responsiveness. Always emails, always calls. You always have to jump back and
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:56.320]   forth. It makes you dumber. You've invested in these brains and your knowledge work organization,
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:02.160]   and now you are reducing their ability to actually produce value. So in a perfect world,
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:07.760]   you make this case. And what would be the books? The books that I wrote to be relevant would be
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.720]   Deep Work, World Without Email, and Slow Productivity. You make this case. You give them
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:17.040]   those books. They say, I like the sound of this Cal guy. These ideas make sense. And then they're
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:23.760]   not bad bosses. Probably won't work. It's worth trying, but it probably won't work.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.640]   So what do you need to do then? Well, you need to cash in your career capital to make your
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:37.920]   situation better. That could be either changing your setup as your employer, changing your setup
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:44.720]   so that you are willing to trade accountability for autonomy. Usually that means I'm going to
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:52.080]   focus on just this thing, which is much more self-driven, autonomously executed, as opposed to
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.800]   juggling a lot of easy things, being a general vessel for the to-dos your boss might have.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.920]   You say, no, no, I handle this type of thing. So I'm not super accessible and I'm pretty autonomous,
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.240]   but in exchange, you can hold me very accountable. And if I'm not delivering objectively,
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.360]   the numbers are here, this thing is selling, the client dollars are coming through the door,
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.200]   however you measure yourself. If I'm not objectively producing value, then you can
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.400]   get rid of me or move me back to what I was doing before. That type of trade works well here,
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:27.520]   because often the thing these types of bosses fear is they're being taken advantage of,
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.200]   or you're not working hard or you want to get out, or why do you want to work from home? Why do you
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.800]   want to be less accessible? I'm worried that you're taking advantage of me when you're able
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.160]   to have accountability. No, no, you're going to look at this number. It's objectified. I'm creating
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:43.280]   this much value. It gets rid of that fear and it allows them to be like, okay, you're doing that.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:48.320]   Great. And I'll go bother these other people with my email. The other thing you might do is just
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:55.520]   find better bosses. What should you be looking for when you're looking for a job? What should
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.200]   you be working for when it comes to these type of issues? I always say the main thing you should be
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.720]   looking for is not a particular idea that they subscribe to about management or work or time
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:12.080]   management. What you should be looking for is an interest in openness to systems. Bosses that say,
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:18.160]   okay, you have a way you want to organize your work. You have a reason you want to do it that
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.520]   way. Great. I love that initiative. Try it. Let's see how it goes. You want to have bosses that if
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.840]   you ask them, like, what's your time management philosophy, that they're going to go roll a white
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.400]   board into the room and be like, sit down. It's going to take a while. Like bosses who think a
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:37.280]   lot about the actual structure and organizational work because they are going to be more open and
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.640]   adaptable to you actually trying systems of work that's going to be less frenetic, less hyperactive
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:48.960]   hive mind, less overload, less context switching. I think anti-system bosses like the types of bosses
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:57.840]   you have are a real problem and we don't qualify or quantify the impact of that problem enough.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:04.320]   I think bosses that demand responsiveness have no interest in systems, have no interest in good or
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:09.120]   bad ways to work, but just sort of see it more as like, do you respond to me? And I want to make
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:14.720]   sure no one's pulling a fast one on me. That's as bad as having a verbally abusive boss. That's as
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:21.440]   bad as having an incompetent boss. That's as bad as having a boss whose behavior directly conflicts
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:27.360]   with your ethical values. And we should treat it as such. I really care about, is this a workplace
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:35.840]   that respects the way the human brain functions and is open to people being critical and systematic
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.400]   about how they approach their day and their time and their work. And if it's not, I mean,
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.760]   I think you need warning sirens going. We should be more willing to see that as being a major
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:49.280]   problem. If more people push back about that, if more people chose employers based on that,
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.560]   if more people left employers based on that, I think employers will get better.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.960]   So I think anti-system bosses, we should treat that as the problem that it is.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.680]   So I emailed with Trevor a little bit. He's the overall boss, and these are two managers below
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:07.200]   him. But I think the same advice probably holds true in terms of. Oh, that's that changed. Yeah.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.800]   That's interesting. Yeah. Oh, then you have some leverage there, Trevor. Give them the three books.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   If they don't do it, you can get rid of them. Yeah. And have systems like read the books,
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.400]   work with them. So how do you want to structure your workloads? How do you want to structure your
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.520]   communication? Like what's going on? Put the ideas from the books in place, have them read the books
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.720]   so they understand the underlying ideas. I think they'll come around because it's like a much
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.360]   better way to work. The people who have trouble with the more systematic way of working are the
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:42.080]   people who are leveraging the smoke screen of artificial busyness to get away with not actually
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:47.200]   doing work. Those are the people who have trouble. The people who say, wait a second, if I actually
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:52.640]   have to go and execute hard things on a schedule, it's going to require a lot of focus and
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.600]   organization. It's not going to be easy and it might not go well unless I give it my full
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.080]   attention. Some people look at that and say, I can't do that or I have no interest in doing that.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.760]   Can't I just like jump back and forth on a bunch of emails and calls and be busy and be in the mix
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:08.640]   of things and kind of just give the pseudo productive sense that like I'm around. Right.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:12.640]   Those people sometimes struggle when you try to get more systematic, but that's great because
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:17.440]   you don't want those people at least not in that type of position. If it's in a cognitive production
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:22.480]   oriented position, you need people who can actually do the hard cognitive work of producing value.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:26.400]   Yeah. All right. So Trevor, you're in a better situation, I thought, but that other advice
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:33.760]   holds for anyone whose bosses above them are really being a problem. Now, what do we got next,
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:38.960]   Jesse? Next question is from Blake. I'm a physician. And as I understand it, my interactions
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:44.480]   with patients is considered deep work. The problem is that I have to contact switch all day between
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.600]   different patients. Physicians are evaluated by volume, quality doesn't matter. To my managers,
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:54.400]   I just need to avoid a lawsuit. How do I navigate this situation in a deep manner?
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:00.800]   Well, there's two related issues here. There's a specific issue of modern medical practice and the
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:05.360]   volume of patients. That's a big problem. Not a problem I'm going to be able to solve. That's a
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.920]   problem with medical care and reimbursement in this country. But your first issue is important
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.320]   because it gets to a general point that I think applies to a lot of people, which is what is the
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:19.840]   scale at which you're measuring deep work, right? So you're saying you're thinking about each
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:26.480]   patient engagement as a standalone deep work session. And it is deep work. You're dealing
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.720]   with a patient. What's happening? You're bringing in a lot of information. You're putting the
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.920]   context. You're trying to figure out what's going on. You're looking for subtle patterns and
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.640]   realizing like I think it's this, but this symptom over here maybe isn't really fitting with that
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.960]   type of diagnosis and maybe something more complicated is going on. It requires concentration
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:50.720]   of the application of hard one skill. But where I think you could change your view is you then see
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.760]   moving to the next patient as an unrelated deep work session. I'm going to say instead,
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:02.880]   why don't we expand the timescale of this deep work and say a morning spent dealing nonstop with
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:09.520]   patients is one long deep work session. And what happens in this deep work session is like I get
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:14.960]   different types of problems come at me and I have to kind of keep my focus steady and not get too
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.640]   distracted and be able to pivot from this to that and back to this. And it's all medical and it's
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:24.720]   all diagnoses. And I'm in that context. See that as your deep work session. Increasing the scale
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:30.800]   is often helpful in this way because what happens otherwise if you think, okay, this patient's one
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.600]   session, that patient is another session. You're going to release your focus in the two minutes
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.360]   in between. All right. I'm going to like look at my phone. What's going on with sports? What's
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.920]   going on? And you're going to introduce this concentration sapping distraction into your kind
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.760]   of cognitive context. Whereas instead you say like, okay, here's my three hour deep work session.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.800]   I'm going to get through 15 patients. Let's keep our focus. See if we can do this. It's going to
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:58.240]   be much more sustained. I think the scale idea makes more sense when you look at other types
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:05.760]   of examples. It's more obvious. So if you're a math student, you have a problem set, right?
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:13.280]   10 problems. You wouldn't say, well, my problem is I keep having to switch my context because
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:17.440]   first I'm working on this problem. And then I have to work on this problem, which is a different
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:22.320]   problem. And then I'm working on this third problem and it's dealing with something different. And my
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:27.680]   context switch is like, no, no, working on the problem set is one context. You're in the world
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:33.440]   of doing math problems. It's like a radio host, like what I'm doing now. I see answering these
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.920]   five questions I'm answering as a deep work session, not five deep work sessions that are
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:43.600]   kind of unrelated. So in general, think about this. If you worry that your deep work is too fragmented,
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:49.040]   but what's happening is you have one deep work requiring thing after another,
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.560]   start treating that whole thing as one big session. It changes your mindset.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.520]   You pace yourself, you maintain better concentration. And I think it just works out better.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:05.360]   All right, who do we got next? Next up is Laura. I have a remarkable two tablet and why I love it.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:10.960]   I'm still drawn to using other planners and single purpose notebooks. How do I merge these tools? I'm
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:18.480]   feeling a bit of notebook overwhelmed. I think of my remarkable to as like a stack of a bunch of
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:25.280]   notebooks put into one. So however many notebooks you have in your remarkable two, you're saving
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:31.520]   yourself having to carry or keep track of that many notebooks. I also don't have everything in
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:37.760]   my remarkable two. Mainly I do single purpose notebooks. I still do those. Almost everything
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.840]   else. I guess I do have my remarkable two. I've got my planner, obviously time block planners
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.640]   paper. I don't do that in my remarkable. I have single purpose notebooks. I don't have any going
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:52.160]   right now. But when I'm working on a new big project, I'll pull that out to really get into it.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:57.120]   Small field notebook just for working on a single project. And most everything else I keep in my
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:03.520]   remarkable. So I think it's okay if you have some other notebooks. If you have other sort of
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:09.680]   physical notebooks that aren't single purpose, you just sort of are using pages of some normal
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:14.400]   notebook or legal pad to work on something. You might want to bring that back to your remarkable
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:19.600]   two. I kind of like the discipline of like, this is just like my general purpose notebook for
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.880]   working out anything that needs to be worked out because now you have a nice copy of everything.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:27.040]   You only have to bring one thing with you. But I think a planner plus remarkable plus single
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.720]   purpose notebooks, that's a completely fine combination. To me, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:39.120]   Remarkable. All right, here we go. Next up is Natasha. Have you considered adding the category
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.880]   creativity to the deep life buckets of craft contemplation community in celebration? I guess
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:50.000]   this could fit into craft category, but I think it goes deeper than that. Well, when it comes to deep
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.600]   life buckets, the key is having buckets. The particular collection of buckets you have is
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.840]   somewhat arbitrary, right? So like the whole idea here is just to make sure that when you are
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:05.280]   reflecting on what matters to your life, that you're not getting myopic, that you're not having
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:10.480]   all of your attention snap into just one aspect of your life, such as your career. And so having
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:17.360]   the different areas broken out allows you to look at each of those areas separately and have a part
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.000]   of your vision for the life well lived that touches on each of those areas, right? So when you're
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.680]   creating that master narrative, your ideal lifestyle, these buckets are going to help you
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:33.440]   be sufficiently broad in that thinking. When you're trying to take action to get closer towards your
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.760]   ideal lifestyle, these buckets will help you divide those actions among different areas that
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.520]   are important, right? So having buckets is critical. The specific buckets you use, it
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.240]   doesn't really matter. You'll probably change them. So for example, I've been experimenting
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:55.120]   recently with a different set of bucket definitions that are based off of a body metaphor.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:59.840]   So I'll run this by quickly. I should do a whole episode on this, but just to give you a sense,
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.840]   like something I've been messing around with, because it actually works kind of well. It's not
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:11.520]   alliterative, but it's based on the body. So think about this. You have, when thinking about your
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:18.640]   ideal life, the head, so this is where you're thinking about your mental life, your intellectual
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:24.720]   life. It's things like ideas and reading and what quiet and what role your phone plays in your life
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.800]   and like the type of stuff we were playing in the deep dive. That's covered in your head in this
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:35.360]   metaphor. You have the heart, that covers relationships, connection to community, to
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.200]   family, to other people, right? So that's where you deal with like the role of other people in
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:47.840]   your life. Hands, this is sort of corresponds to craft. Your work, like what it is that you're
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.640]   actually creating, but also like skilled pursuits that may be non-professional, like hobby type
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.280]   pursuits, but it's craft in general. We think about like what you're building things with your
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:02.000]   hands. So it's like producing new things of value in the world and enjoying the process of doing it
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.600]   yourself. This is kind of stretching the body a little bit, but we could say the soul, the deal
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:13.360]   with philosophical, theological type of issues that are critical to your conception of your life
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:18.160]   to well live. And then here's a new one I added. So Jesse, this didn't fall under the alliterative
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:25.280]   buckets that had the C's in it. Feet, and I don't know if you can guess, but what I'm thinking about
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:33.520]   for feet is the places you live in exist. So that's thinking about on the big scale, like where
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:40.240]   I live, you know, what city do I live in? What type of house door in that city? Where do I live?
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.800]   Like it could be those types of decisions, but it can also be the spaces in the place you already
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.680]   live. So like the renovation I'm doing on the maker lab of the HQ, that would also be something
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:55.600]   that would fall under the feet, the feet component of this type of deep life decomposition. It's like
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:02.480]   where you, the places you stand. That's one it's coming up and I'm working on my deep life book.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:08.800]   It's coming up that we didn't deal enough with that probably in the show, but like the places
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.920]   in which you exist play a big role in like your perception of a life, like where you live, what
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.600]   type of place you live in, what your spaces are like. So like I'm messing around with that. It's
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:22.640]   a body metaphor, you know, I don't know, maybe something else works as well. I, what I'm trying
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.880]   to emphasize there is you do need categories for understanding the parts of your life that
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:31.680]   are important to you, but my categories might be different than yours and your categories might
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:37.520]   change over time. Just like now I've moved on from the alliterative C's to trying out body metaphors.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:43.360]   All right. Ooh, are we up to the slow? It looks like the slow productivity corner.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:59.120]   We are. All right. So let's hear that theme music for those who are new. The slow productivity
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.320]   corner is where we take a question that is relevant to my most recent book,
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:09.280]   slow productivity, the lost art of accomplishment without burnout. If you have not yet read that
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:15.360]   book, you should get it wherever books are sold. A large fraction of what we talk about on the show
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.480]   is based at least in some part of what we talked about in that book. So it's sort of like the user
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.080]   guide to deep questions. All right, Jesse, what's our slow productivity corner question of the week.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:28.160]   It's from Susan moving away from pseudo work makes me feel very vulnerable. I went from being
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.960]   able to tell my bosses about 15 teeny incremental updates to only being able to talk about one or
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:38.160]   two projects at a time. Nobody has jumped on my throat about this, but I'm feeling guilty.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.480]   My friends are also judging me because I'm not putting in a solid eight hours at the desk.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:48.480]   They believe in sit still and look busy. I'll do things like take a nap, hopefully to think better,
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.960]   wander around outside or sit in a comfy chair and journal about a work project to help me come up
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:57.360]   with solutions. Well, Susan, I like the direction you're going. I'm going to give you some
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:02.000]   reassurance here. First of all, your friends aren't judging you. They don't care. They don't
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.800]   really care about your work habits. Maybe someone made a comment once. I wouldn't worry too much
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:13.440]   about it too. I want to advertise too much. This is like the hidden secret of people who
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:19.200]   follow the slow productivity philosophy. You know, you can construct these very sustainable,
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.680]   energizing, productive, professional lives. You're doing stuff that matters,
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.680]   but your life is very sustainable and interesting. We don't advertise it much
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:33.120]   because again, you're right. A lot of people don't get it. They are caught up in the cult of pseudo
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:37.920]   work, which as I explained in the book is where you believe that visible activity is the best
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:44.400]   proxy for useful effort. And to that mindset, anything that reduces work in the moment is
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:50.240]   dangerous. So just don't advertise, take your naps, sit in your comfy chair, but maybe just
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.680]   don't tell people that's what you're doing. They're probably not going to reassure you
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:59.680]   because they don't understand. And also they probably don't care that much. Third, you need
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:05.760]   to focus on part three of the slow productivity framework. So you're doing the first two parts,
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:11.360]   doing fewer things, working at a natural pace. Excellent. To make that work in a way that is
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:16.560]   sustainable, that doesn't make you feel guilty or similarly build up like a resentment towards
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:23.040]   work in general is quality. You need to become obsessed with the quality of what you produce.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.800]   Now that you're doing fewer things at a natural pace, you need to get obsessed about the quality
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:31.440]   of what you produced in a way that you didn't have to bother and you're doing 15 things. It's
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.640]   impossible to do anything that well. Anyways, you're doing 15 things. You're getting credit
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.920]   for being busy. Now you're going to get credit for doing things well. And as you start delivering
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:45.200]   things that catch people's attention as being unusually good, the scrutiny on you will go down
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.040]   and your self-scrutiny on your behavior is going to reduce as well. You're going to feel more
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:56.160]   confident in this new approach to work. So be careful about your time, time block plan,
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.520]   make sure that you're giving large blocks of focused work on the things that matter.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:07.200]   Adopt a deliberate practice mindset where you're trying to deliberately get better at the skills
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:12.400]   that you're applying in your work. You're like an athlete training to get a better free throw
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:17.360]   percentage or to cut some time off of your mile run times. You want to be practicing systematically
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:24.480]   to get better. Get obsessed with quality and then you'll feel much better about the other
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:28.640]   parts about your life that are now getting more sustainable. That's the whole mix that makes this
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.920]   whole thing work. You're not doing too much. Your pace is varied, but the stuff you're doing is very
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:37.840]   good. You have to have all three. I think as you obsess over quality and as you see the tangible
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:44.640]   results of that obsession, you're going to feel much better. So you're on the right track. Slow
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:50.080]   productivity is such a better way to approach the working world. So keep it up, but get the quality
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:55.600]   in your crosshairs as well because that's going to make this whole thing work. All right. Let's
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:08.480]   hear that music one more time. All right. Usually around this time in the show, we like to take a
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:14.080]   call from a reader or listener, I suppose. It's hard, Jesse. I have so many different ways that
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.880]   people encounter me. They watch me, they listen to me and they read me. So I have to kind of get
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:22.720]   that straight. We'll say listeners. All right. So do we have a call from a listener this week?
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:30.800]   We do. All right. Hi, Kel and Jesse. My name is Nancy and I live in Brussels,
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:38.560]   Belgium, in Europe. I have a question about episode 319. You tell us that when you do deep
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:44.320]   work and you've been disturbed, it takes about 20 minutes to refocus to do deep work again.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:51.280]   But what about the Pomodoro technique? Because then you work for 25 minutes and you take a 5
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:58.560]   minute break and then you work again for 25 minutes. How does it match with the 20 minutes
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:06.240]   it takes to regain focus? Thank you. Bye. That's a very good question. Actually, interestingly,
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:14.320]   you know, the 20 minute, that specific quantity, I was having a hard time remembering exactly where
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:20.400]   that particular number came from. Now, the fact that it takes a long time on the scale of many
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:26.400]   minutes to return your focus after a distraction, that is well known in multiple different studies.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:32.480]   You can look, for example, at Sophie Leroy's work on attention residue, among others that have
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:38.080]   quantified this. But if you go back and read Sophie's papers, for example, she doesn't quantify
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.520]   exactly how long it takes. But I had this 20 minutes. I've always used this 20 minutes. I
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:47.840]   couldn't remember where it came from until I was researching for the deep dive at the beginning of
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:53.680]   the episode. I was going back to Winifred Gallagher's book, Wrapped. And I discovered,
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.920]   oh, that's where it's from. She talks to a cognitive scientist in that book who's talking
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:04.880]   about the distraction and bringing your attention back. And he gives that exact number. It takes
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:09.280]   about 20 minutes to get your attention back after you're distracted. So it's like I rediscovered
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:14.320]   where that specific value came from. Clearly, it's not so precise. It could be 7 minutes. It could be
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:18.880]   27 minutes. It kind of depends. But it's many minutes. OK, so back to the Pomodoro technique.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:25.840]   For that to work, so you're talking about 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off. For that to work,
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:30.960]   you can't initiate a significant context switch in the 5 minutes off.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:37.040]   Back in the old days of my newsletter and blog, I had a term for this. I called it deep breaks.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.520]   What you're doing if you want the Pomodoro technique to succeed, what you're doing during
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:46.480]   that time off is you're giving your brain a breather, but you're not distracting your brain.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:54.400]   So it's like, OK, I bring the intensity down, but then I walk to get coffee and come back. I go down
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:51:01.600]   the hallway and back. I stretch out and then do my next Pomodoro. What you can't do is expose
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:06.800]   your brain during that short break to highly salient distractions that are unrelated to the
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:14.320]   task at hand. So if you look at your email, if you look at social media, right, or start a
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:18.560]   conversation with a colleague about an unrelated project during that break, your next Pomodoro is
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:24.320]   going to be much worse. You probably won't, as you said in the call, you probably won't get your
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:29.600]   full concentration back towards the end of that Pomodoro. A couple of things I would say, though,
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:33.520]   in addition to deep breaks, is if you're going to do a Pomodoro type technique, I call it interval
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:38.640]   training, concentration interval training. I would probably start, I guess, 25 minutes is a good place
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:45.600]   to start, but you want to increase that duration as you get comfortable, right? Once you can hit
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:51.120]   those 25 minutes without it being too much of a cognitive strain, make it 35. Once you can do 35
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:57.120]   minutes without it being too much of a cognitive strain, make it 45. So maybe you want to do a week
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:03.440]   or two at each duration. You want that duration of comfortable focus to get pretty close to about
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:09.360]   90 minutes, then you're set. If you can keep focus on something for 90 minutes, it's not easy,
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:14.320]   but without it being like a real impossibility where like your attention just wanders off and
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.080]   you run out of steam and your mind can't tolerate it, if you can like consistently do 90-minute
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:25.360]   blocks, think about that as like you have trained the fitness of your brain to a level that like you
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:30.400]   can do some damage now with deep work, all right? So the first part of my advice is if you're taking
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:35.440]   short breaks in between sprints, you can't expose yourself to highly salient distractions. I mean,
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:42.800]   if you really need to look at something, make it non-super engaging and super unrelated to your
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:51.200]   work. Like you could look at baseball trade rumors on a break from like academic work because it's,
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.360]   you know, it's just like kind of interesting, but it's not something that's going to capture
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:01.120]   your attention or create a lingering sense of distraction, all right? So that's my advice. Take
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:06.400]   deep breaks, expand those Pomodoro sessions over time until they're much longer than 25 minutes.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:12.640]   All right, I think now we have a case study. This is where you, my listeners, send in your own
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:16.720]   accounts of putting the type of things we talked about on the show in the practice in your own life.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:22.720]   Today's case study comes from Yael. Yael says, "I've been a longtime reader and listener,
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:26.880]   and your advice has guided me well. I wanted to share some recent developments in my life
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:32.000]   as a case study. I'm a 39-year-old social psychologist, and as my children grew older,
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.720]   I felt the need for a career change. This led me to enroll in a master's program in
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.200]   counseling psychology at a prestigious university in New York. Your voice kept echoing in my mind,
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:44.720]   encouraging me to build on the skills and abilities I've developed over the years,
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:50.800]   which influenced my decision. During the first semester of the program, I used a time-blocking
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:54.880]   method. I even bought your journal, though I never wrote in it. I still plan my days on a
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:59.840]   simple notepad with your journal as inspiration. My grades were all As. I submitted every assignment
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:04.480]   ahead of time and received excellent feedback. But that's not all. During this first semester,
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.840]   I conducted meaningful research, built connections with a well-known professor,
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:13.840]   and presented our preliminary findings at a major conference in New York City. I also used to run a
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:17.600]   large Facebook group where I shared my thoughts and interesting discoveries from my reading and
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:23.840]   research. I loved how quickly I could jot down ideas and receive immediate reactions. However,
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:28.240]   it eventually became too time-consuming without much tangible benefit. I've often heard you
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:33.120]   explain how we like to believe things will work a certain way, like gaining popularity through
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.720]   social media and being discovered, but that's not how things usually unfold in the real world.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.720]   Instead, I've shifted my focus to writing my thoughts more coherently, and I've started
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:46.720]   publishing them in a widely-read newspaper. I like this case study for a couple reasons.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:54.480]   One, there's a good reminder here for students, which is that being systematic about the job of
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:00.400]   being a student will make you a very good student. Most students are terrible at being a student.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:05.120]   They don't manage their time. They don't have a realistic plan for how they're going to get
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:09.440]   their things done. They give no foresight to how they're going to approach their assignments,
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:13.680]   what techniques work, what don't. They don't adjust their approaches based on what they learn
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:22.720]   in practice. And because of that, if you are focused and systematic, it's a major advantage.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:28.240]   And I hear from especially students coming back later in life, because students come back later
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.280]   in life are much more likely to treat it like a job. I hear from these type of students again and
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.920]   again, "I'm crushing it, right? Because I'm treating this like a job. I'm an adult." So
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:40.720]   all students out there, take this lesson to heart. If you apply the type of advice we talk about here
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:46.000]   to student life, you are going to seem like a superstar. I also like the point here about the
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:52.080]   Facebook group. It's easy to write stories about something and what it's going to do and why it's
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:58.080]   good, but the story isn't necessarily true. And you have to be willing to act on what you discover.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:02.160]   So like, yeah, you're like, "I'm on this Facebook group and I'm publishing stuff and I get feedback
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.000]   and I have a story that this is important for my ideation because it's kind of fun.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.040]   And I have a deeper story that maybe I'm going to be discovered and go viral and it's going to
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:15.920]   lead to all these great things." But the reality you discover is like, "It's distracting me.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:20.880]   It takes a lot of time. Maybe it strokes my ego, but it's not helping me get better at what I do."
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:24.320]   And so Yale said, "No, enough of that. I'll do something harder and more traditional,
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:29.360]   like trying to publish in a newspaper, push myself to get better." As she points out,
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.320]   we often tell this story to ourselves about social media. We often tell ourselves a story about how
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.920]   what we're doing professionally on social media is critical
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.320]   to our success. We have this big audience and we would disappear without it.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:47.760]   And the reality is often that's not true. The sense that you have an audience that cares is
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.120]   something that is carefully constructed by these platforms to keep you using it.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:58.560]   But for 99.9% of people and jobs and companies, it's not at the core of doing what you do better.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:04.240]   So Yale, I appreciate that case study. All right, what we got for our final segment,
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:09.280]   we'll be talking about the books I read last month. But first, hear from another sponsor.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:18.400]   We actually have a new sponsor today. It is a game-changing product that you can use before
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:25.520]   a night out that will include drinks. The product is called Pre-Alcohol. Let's be honest,
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:33.040]   people like Jesse and I, we're older than we used to be. The 20-year-old Dartmouth student in my
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:39.760]   path probably had an easier time having a few drinks with friends than the 42-year-old version
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:47.120]   of me, where now you get two beers in and the next day you're on a stretcher.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:53.520]   Can't party as hard as we used to there, Jesse. But sometimes it's nice to go out and celebrate
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:58:00.640]   an event or to go catch up with a good friend. And that's where the idea of Pre-Alcohol comes in.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:06.800]   In particular, the product I want to talk about here is Z-Biotics Pre-Alcohol Probiotic Drink.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:11.360]   It's the world's first genetically engineered probiotic. It was invented by PhD scientists
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:16.240]   to tackle rough mornings after drinking. So here's how this works. When you drink,
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:23.120]   alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut. It is this byproduct, not dehydration,
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:29.040]   that's to blame for your rough next day. Pre-alcohol produces an enzyme to break that
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:36.800]   product down. So what you do is you drink the pre-alcohol before you start, before you have
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:41.760]   your drinks. You remember to make Z-Biotics your first drink of the night, then you drink
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:49.360]   responsibly and feel your best the next day. So, hey, I think this is something that's invented
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:56.400]   is a godsend for those of us who no longer rage like we once were able to, and now can actually,
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.840]   again, have that night out, catching up with a friend or a birthday party,
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:07.280]   throw down some Z-Biotics first and lessen the impact of having that fun night out, right?
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:11.280]   So I kept hearing about pre-alcohol and wonder what it was actually like. I've tried this out.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:15.680]   I get what people are talking about. It's a good idea. And with their GMO technology,
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.600]   Z-Biotics is continuing to invent probiotics that will help with everyday challenges of
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:28.080]   modern living. So go to zbiotics.com/cal to learn more and get 15% off your first order when you use

[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:55.840]   Shopify. When you think about businesses where sales are rocketing, right, like Feastables by
[00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:03.360]   Mr. Beast or Thrive Cosmetics or Silicon Valley's new mandatory weekend uniform supplier, Cotopaxi,
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.880]   you might think about their innovative projects, sure, like their progressive band or their
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:11.280]   button down marketing. But an overlooked secret to their success
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:19.360]   is the businesses behind the business of making selling simple. And for millions of businesses,
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:26.560]   that business is Shopify. Nobody does selling better than Shopify. They're the home of the

[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:38.720]   today, Shopify.com/deep. All right, Jesse, let's get to our final segment.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:44.000]   All right, it's the first episode in a new month, I want to review the five books I read
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.400]   in the month before. So we'll be talking now about the books I read in September 2024.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:59.200]   The first book I read was The Devil's Teeth by Susan Casey. I am a big Susan Casey fan. I'm
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.320]   actually trying to find a way to interview her because I want to interview her for my new book,
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.520]   maybe even get her on this podcast. If you know Susan, let me know. But I'm going back and
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:12.480]   rereading some of the Susan Casey catalog. The Devil's Teeth I think was her, I think it was
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:19.360]   her first book. It takes place, so The Devil's Teeth is referring to the Farallones or Farallones,
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.000]   I don't know how to pronounce it, islands off the coast of California, right beyond San Francisco.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.120]   It happens to be the place that has one of the most consistent largest populations
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:36.880]   of large great white sharks. And it's a typical Susan Casey book, so it is adventure/science.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.800]   So she goes out there and she spends time on the island and on a boat off the island,
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:46.240]   and the boat almost sinks. But you learn about the people on the island and the sharks and what
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:52.080]   they're learning about the sharks. And Casey does, she's a great writer. It makes sense,
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.520]   I mean, she was the editor at Outside during the John Krakauer era, so she really understands how
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:02.960]   to do adventure writing. I'm actually rereading The Wave right now, so I'm kind of in a Susan Casey
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:09.440]   trip. Her most recent book, which was about deep ocean, what's it called? The Underworld,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.720]   also fantastic, I recommend it. All right. And then I read The Outrun by Amy Liptrott.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:25.040]   It's a memoir. So Amy Liptrott, she grew up on one of these small Scottish islands,
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.040]   sort of like beyond the Shetland Islands. I don't know the UK geography well, but I think this is,
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:35.280]   you go north from Scotland and they have these islands that people live on. Grew up on a small
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.560]   island, escaped to London, kind of loved the city life, but became a really serious alcoholic.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:48.320]   Returns to this island where she grew up, this is a memoir. Returns to this island as part of
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.240]   her process of getting sober. So it's kind of a memoir of that return to the island and
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:58.720]   rediscovering herself and finding sobriety. She's a very good writer. I think I was attracted to it
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.120]   because I was attracted to these islands. And it was cool to hear about what life is like
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.560]   on these small windswept North Atlantic Scottish islands.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:16.480]   All right. Then I read The Amateurs by David Halberstam. This is about rowers, scholars,
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:25.840]   preparing for '84 Olympics, I think. I don't know. Which ones did we boycott, Jesse? Was that
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:32.960]   1980? I can look it up. Well, anyways, it follows a group of scholars
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:40.400]   who are preparing to compete for the spots on the Olympic team for one of the Olympics in the '80s.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:46.320]   It's called The Amateurs because the point was, scholing was one of the last truly amateur sports
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:52.000]   at the Olympics in that there is no professional career in it. These are people doing it in their
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:00.880]   own time. And Halberstam follows four or five of these characters. They're all ex-Ivy League
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.240]   rowers who are basically scholing full time and trying to compete for these spots. And
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:11.600]   it's good. I mean, clearly, he was influenced by John McPhee. There's definitely a levels of the
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:19.520]   sense of the game type vibe to this book. Maybe more detail than you really want to hear. I guess
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.200]   if I'm going to critique, it's a famous book. These people aren't that interesting.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:31.040]   The story is kind of the same. They went to Yale. They wanted their dad's approval because they
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.400]   weren't playing football like their dad and their grandfather and their great grandfather did.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:40.480]   They get in the rowing. They have freak bodies for rowing. They get really good at rowing. All
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:46.480]   they do is row. Rowing really hurts. They want to win the Olympics. And you kind of hear this story
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:54.800]   again and again. The main variation is, I think, one of them went to Harvard. But that's the thing.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:00.640]   He really gets into the pain of competitive scholing, though, too. Part of it is just pain
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:06.640]   tolerance for the last 500 meters when it's all lactic acid. But it's a classic book. And it
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:12.720]   really gives you a sense of rowing. It actually got me-- I'm back on a rowing program. So it had
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:18.960]   that effect. I'm getting back in rowing shape because I have this dream of, when I take my next
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:24.480]   sabbatical, getting back on the river. Yeah, there's a couple of boathouses around. Do you
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.720]   know there's a real serious boathouse in DC? Yes, I do because--
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.440]   The Potomac.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.040]   --my buddy's rowing in college. And I think he was--
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:36.400]   Yeah, I think it's the Potomac Boat Club. It has some Olympians that train there.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:36.880]   Oh, OK.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.400]   Yeah, it's interesting. All right. Then I read-- and this has turned out to be timely,
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:46.960]   but I didn't know it at the time-- The Machine by Joe Poznanski, the baseball columnist. The
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:57.760]   Machine is about that famous 1970s-era Reds team with Pete Rose and Johnny Bench that went on to
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:03.840]   win the World Series. And it's a baseball book that follows that season. And it's good. I mean,
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.480]   it's a well-covered season. Poznanski had a lot of sources to pull from. He's a classic baseball
[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:14.000]   columnist, so you're going to get that kind of classic baseball column style, which is like a
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.840]   very-- if you haven't read these type of classic baseball books, be prepared. It's a very specific
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:27.520]   way of writing. It's high energy. It's sort of in the room. It's kind of like psychologically,
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:32.000]   like you're inside the minds of the players, like how they're feeling about things. And it moves
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.640]   around. But it also has a sort of old-timey feel. It's a real stylized thing, but a well-written
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.600]   book. But anyway, Pete Rose just died a couple of days ago before recording this, so it's kind of
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:47.520]   sad. But it's a good look at that team. The one flaw from a baseball perspective
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:52.000]   is-- I mean, look, this team, it's called the Big Red Machine, they used to call it.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:59.040]   It had a fantastic offense. But it doesn't matter how good your offense is. You win the World
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:05.680]   Series, you have to have your pitching just working. And in this book, man, the pitching
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:11.280]   doesn't come up that much. Like, we're pitching. It's fine. But it's like Pete Rose and how he was
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:17.440]   hitting or this or that. The other thing that seemed to have caught my attention is the way
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:26.400]   Posnansky talks about hitting. It seems to be just a force of will. Like, Rose was mad and
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:30.400]   wanted some hits and tried really hard and got a lot of hits, as opposed to the reality of hitting,
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:35.920]   which is like a game of timing and adjustments and trying to figure out what's going on with
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:40.720]   my swing and what do I need to adjust it, what are the pitchers trying to do with me.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:47.520]   Modern hitting is a cat and mouse game where you are studying that pitcher in the dugout and trying
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.040]   to understand, OK, here's what they're going to come at me with, and here's my strategy to go
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.000]   after it. It's not just I got mad and I'm going to have a big game, and then you hit it. You can't
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.840]   force yourself to hit. The last book I read, this is kind of crazy. I count books in the month I
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.080]   finish them. I've been kind of slowly reading this book in the background for a long time.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:14.480]   It's not really a book you're supposed to read through, but I did anyways. It's called You Shall
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:22.640]   Be Holy by Joseph Telushkin. This is a book on ethics, and it's like a reference book. I mean,
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:30.320]   it's 600 pages, doorstop, and it's like topic by topic, and then with each topic, it's broken down
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:36.640]   in the numbered subtopics. Here's the ethical thing, here, here, here's what citation for this,
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:42.960]   citation for that. It's kind of like a manual. But look, I'm a member of the Center for Digital
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:48.160]   Ethics at Georgetown. I'm the director of the Computer Science, Ethics, and Society Academic
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:53.600]   Program at Georgetown. I'm more involved in my academic life at the intersection of ethics and
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:59.280]   technology, and I was thinking, "I need to know more ethics." Now, there's the sort of formal
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.440]   study of ethics, like coming out of philosophy, and you can study Kant and all this sort of
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:10.160]   normative thinking. But I was like, "I just need to brush up on what our ancient sources tell us
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.280]   about what's good and what's bad in certain situations." So I figured, "Okay, if you want
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.840]   to keep going back, you're eventually going to end up at Jewish sources." So much of the ideas
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:26.960]   of modern Western ethics originate in ideas that go all the way back to the oldest books of the
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:32.720]   Hebrew Bible, which then influenced Christianity, influenced Islam, and then influenced Enlightenment
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:40.160]   human right-based thinking. All of that goes back to ideas that were being worked out in the second
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.600]   millennium BC. So I said, "Great, I'm going to read a book. This is Jewish ethics." So it goes
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.320]   through just super systematically, like, "Well, here's what we know about this from Torah," or
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.480]   what Talmud says here, what a medieval commentary says here. It's just systematic. At some point,
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:58.000]   I was like, "I'm just going to read this whole thing. I'm just going to load into my head a
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.560]   whole bunch of pre-classical sort of ancient ethical thinking, the kind of foundations that
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.760]   develop into the ways we think about these things today." So I read the whole thing.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:15.520]   >> Do they give scenarios? >> Yeah. No, and it gets super precise.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:21.920]   Like, okay, gossip, right? We're talking about gossip. It's going to really break down in the
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:28.320]   subcategories. Like, okay, but what happens if, what about the situation in which you're
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:35.760]   gossiping about another person, but that gossip could prevent the person you're gossiping to
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.440]   from being defrauded? So it's like the prohibition of gossip or the need to help your friend from
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:46.960]   being defrauded, like, what takes precedence? Well, in that case, you should help your friend
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:54.480]   from being defrauded, but minimize the information you give so that it's sufficient to avoid that,
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.560]   but no more than that, because then you're reveling in the gossip. It's always like,
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.560]   you know what I'm saying? It's like category, subcategory, subcategory, and it's meant as a
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:07.920]   reference book. Oh, I want to know about what does Jewish ethics say about this issue. I'll
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.280]   go to the chapter and then go to the subchapter and you look it up. But I just read the whole
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:19.360]   thing through. And I just did it at night. I just read 20 pages. And then it became a nice meditative
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:25.840]   background. I don't even know when I started that, but I finished it last month, so I count it.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:34.480]   Here's the bad part, though. It's volume one. How many volumes? I don't know. I think two or three,
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:41.040]   but I think I got it. I think I got a lot of ethics out of volume one.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:51.040]   All right. Well, anyways, those are the books I read back in September. I'll report back in October
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.320]   what I'm reading right now. Okay. I think that's all the time we have, Jesse. Thank you, everyone,
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:59.840]   for listening to the show. We'll be back next week with a new episode. And until then, as always,
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.680]   stay deep. Hey, so if you enjoyed today's discussion about what happens when you're
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:09.280]   looking at your phone all the time, I think you'll also enjoy episode 298, which is titled
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:15.920]   Rethinking Attention. Check it out. So today I'm going to argue that we misunderstand
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:23.840]   the impact of how we obtain information on the overall quality of our lives.
