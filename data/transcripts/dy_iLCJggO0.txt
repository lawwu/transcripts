[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220]   Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.040]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.220]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.900]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.820]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.460]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.120]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.100]   And now, my conversation with Dr. Duncan French.
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.840]   Duncan French, great to see you again.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.540]   Likewise, likewise, thank you.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.960]   I don't often have many Stanford professors
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.620]   in the Performance Institute, so I'm really excited.
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.100]   Oh, well, this place is amazing,
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.220]   and you have a huge role in making it what it is.
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.140]   I found dozens of papers
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.920]   on how weight training impacts hormones,
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.560]   and your name's on all of them.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.680]   What is it about engaging motor neurons under heavy loads
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.980]   sends a signal to the endocrine system,
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.080]   hey, release testosterone.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.040]   I've never actually been able to find that in a textbook.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.420]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's a stress response, right?
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.540]   It's mechanical stress and it's metabolic stress.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.860]   And these are, you know, the downstream regulation
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.180]   of testosterone release at the gonads
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.500]   comes from many different areas.
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.320]   You know, my work primarily looked at, you know,
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.240]   catecholamines and sympathetic arousal.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.820]   So things like epinephrine, adrenaline.
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.800]   Correct, yeah, epinephrine, adrenaline, you know, noradrenaline.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.080]   How they were signaling, that signaling cascade using, you know,
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.200]   the HPA axis releasing cortisol, and then, you know, looking at how that also influenced
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.960]   the adrenal medulla to release, you know, androgens, and then signaling that at the gonads.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.660]   That raises an interesting question.
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:43.380]   So in presumably weight training in women, people who don't have testes, also it increases
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.180]   testosterone.
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.300]   And is that purely through the adrenals?
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.780]   When women lift weights, their adrenal glands release testosterone?
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.320]   Absolutely.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.300]   I mean, that is the only area of testosterone release for females.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.560]   And yes, it's the same downstream cascade.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.340]   Obviously, the extent to which it happens is significantly less in females.
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.960]   But that's how you, there's good data out there that shows, you know, females can increase
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.020]   their anabolic environment, their internal anabolic milieu, using resistance training as
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.560]   a stressor.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.180]   And then they get the consequent muscle tissue growth, you know, whether it's tendon, ligament,
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.060]   adaptations, you know, the beneficial consequences of resistance training, which is driven by anabolic
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.800]   stimuli.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.580]   Yeah, I have two questions about that.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.380]   The first one is something that you mentioned, which is that the, the androgens, the testosterone
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.580]   comes from the adrenals under resistance loads in women.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.080]   Is the same true in men?
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.740]   I mean, we hear that the testes produce testosterone when we weight train, but do we know whether or
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.020]   not it's the adrenals or the testes in men that are increasing testosterone more, both a
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.700]   little bit from each?
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.660]   The field is divided presently.
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:53.920]   And as much as understanding the acute adrenergic response in terms of, you know, anabolic response
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.720]   to exercise in an acute phase and the exposure to, you know, a stimulus that is stress driven,
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.700]   which might be partly from the adrenal glands, partly from the gonads versus a longitudinal exposure
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.100]   exposure to anabolic environments, which is primarily driven by, obviously, the gonads and the release,
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.200]   the endocrine environment from testosterone release at the gonads.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.720]   So the field is split in terms of how exercise is promoting hypertrophy, you know, muscle tissue
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   growth, and whether that is very much an adrenal stimuli or if that's significant enough in these
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.980]   acute responses versus the longitudinal exposure, just elevated basal levels of anabolic testosterone
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.460]   habitual levels.
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.460]   And then you mentioned that testosterone can have enhancing effects, growth effects on tendon
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.000]   and ligament also, that you don't often hear about that.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.740]   People always think, you know, testosterone muscle, but testosterone has a lot of effects on
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.020]   other tissues that are important for performance, it sounds like.
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.980]   And what's the story there?
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:55.580]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.300]   I mean, the testosterone hormone is, I mean, listen, there's androgen receptors on neural tissue,
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.140]   on neural axons.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.300]   It's pretty much everywhere.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.860]   Exactly.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.840]   So, you know, the binding capacity of testosterone and influencing different tissues within the
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.020]   body, I touched on, you know, muscle tissue, but, you know, the ligaments, the tendons, even
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.000]   bone to some extent, you know, testosterone is potential to influence that in terms of removing
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.380]   osteopenic kind of characteristics, et cetera.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:31.880]   So, yeah, it's a magic hormone, let's say, with many, many end impacts in terms of adaptation.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.440]   Could you say that there's some general principles of training that favor testosterone production in
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.400]   terms of, that somebody who's not an elite athlete could use, who's trying to use weight
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.240]   training to build or maintain muscle, lose body fat, so body recomposition, and/or stay strong and healthy
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.920]   for sport of a different kind?
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.880]   Testosterone is really stimulated by an intensity factor and also a volume factor.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.560]   Now, growth hormone is a little bit different.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.360]   That's largely driven by an intensity factor alone.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.560]   If you look at many of the exercise interventions that we use to try and investigate and interrogate
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.160]   testosterone, it was usually, you know, a six by 10 protocol.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.240]   So, six sets of 10 repetitions, which is quite a large, you know, 60 repetitions is quite a large
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.200]   volume for a single exercise. And that was usually pitched at about 80% of a one repetition max intensity.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.800]   Okay. So, 80% of the one rep max, six sets of 10 reps separated by rest of-
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.520]   Two minutes.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.280]   Two minutes, which is actually pretty fast.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.600]   Yes.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.240]   At least to me.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.560]   It is.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.760]   Anytime you see these two to three minutes, when you're actually watching the clock,
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.760]   those two minute rest periods go by pretty fast.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.000]   By the third, fourth set, you're dying for more.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.320]   We formulated that kind of exercise protocol to really target, you know, the release of
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.160]   testosterone and try and drive up these anabolic environments to study the, you know,
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.120]   the endocrine, you know, consequences.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.320]   But I think that's the type of protocol that is most advantageous for driving anabolic environments.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.080]   And that was it for the workout?
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.360]   Yeah, we would do that in a back squat. So, you know, multi-joint, you know, challenging
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.760]   exercise, multi-muscle, multi-joint, 80% load of your one repetition max, and then six by 10.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.600]   We did play around with, you know, your classic German volume type 10 by 10 kind of protocols,
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:29.000]   but they were just unsustainable at that 80%. The key to what we also did was we always adjusted
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.360]   the loads to make sure that it was 10 repetitions that were sustained.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:41.480]   So if the load was too high and an athlete or a participant had to drop the weight on the sixth
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.920]   repetition, we would unload the bar and make sure they completed the 10 repetitions.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.400]   I see.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.840]   Bringing me back to the point of it's an intensity and a volume derivative that is going to be most
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.840]   advantageous for testosterone release.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.680]   So that sort of hints at the possibility that the thresholds for going from a workout that increases
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.160]   testosterone to a workout that diminishes testosterone is actually a pretty narrow margin.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.360]   Yeah. And I think it comes back to that intensity factor then, you know, what we saw with that 10
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.040]   by 10 protocol really sees pretty significant drop offs in the load. And again, we're trying to
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.720]   stimulate with intensity, with mechanical strain through intensity, as well as metabolic strain
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.680]   through volume. And I think that's the paradigm that you've got to look at is that the mechanical load
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:31.560]   has to come from, you know, the actual weight on the bar and the volume is the metabolic stimulus.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.600]   How much are we driving lactate? How much are we driving, you know, glycogenolysis in terms of that
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:43.320]   type of energy system for, you know, executing a 10 by 10 protocol. And what we often saw was just
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:49.080]   a significant reduction in the intensity capabilities of an athlete to sustain that. So we shortened the
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:55.560]   volume and to try and maintain the intensity. Is there any evidence that training slowly can offset
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.560]   some of the negative effects of doing a lot of volume?
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:04.360]   The rest is often the consideration that's overlooked out there in general population and in many
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.720]   sporting environments. You know, that the rest is as important a programming variable as the load and
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:16.440]   the intensity, the load, the volume, etc. If you extend the duration of your rest periods, what you're
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:22.440]   ultimately doing is influencing that metabolic stimulus again. You're allowing the flushing of the body, the removal of
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:28.120]   waste products, you know, lactate to be, you know, removed from the body and then the metabolic
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.920]   environment is reduced.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.800]   So if I understand correctly, you want to create a metabolic stress.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.440]   Absolutely.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:41.640]   So I could, I could in theory do a 45 or 60 minute session where I pack in more, more work per unit
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.040]   time. I'm not going to be able to quote unquote perform as well. I won't be able to lift as much.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.360]   Yeah. I'm going to have to, you know, unweight the bar between sets or maybe even during sets if I
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.920]   have someone who could do that, but it sounds like that's the way to go. So it's got to be,
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.160]   so this, the old adage of high intensity, short duration is probably the way to go.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.800]   Correct. And, and, and, you know, in, in, in layman's terms, if the same objective,
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.960]   the same training goal is just muscle tissue growth, and we're not talking about maximal
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.720]   strength or any of those types of parameters. We're just talking about growing muscle.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.600]   If there's an athlete A and they do six, six sets of 10 with two minutes rest, and there's athlete B
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.240]   that does six sets of 10 with three minutes left rest. Athlete A will likely see the highest
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.120]   muscle gains because of the metabolic stimulus that they're driving with the shorter rest periods.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.880]   What about day-to-day recovery? I mean, can the workout that you described as intense,
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.160]   but short, how many days a week can the typical person do that and sustain progress?
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.680]   Yeah. I mean, I think that comes back to your training age and your training history. Obviously,
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:44.040]   there's a resilience and a robustness with, with an incremental training age. So a protocol like that,
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.200]   we would look at two, two times, you know, a week, something that's, that's pretty intensive
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.120]   like that. Because again, it comes back to the point you make is that you really need to be,
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.640]   for want of better terms, suffering a little bit through that type of protocol, both in terms of,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.680]   of the challenge of the load, but also being able to tolerate the, the metabolic stress that you're
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:08.120]   exposed to. It's, it's a, it's a, you know, a bit of a sicko feeling, right? Because of the lactate
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.640]   that you're driving up. So, you know, I wouldn't promote as an athlete doing that type of modality,
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.920]   you know, multiple, multiple times, unless you're from the realms of bodybuilding. And then you really,
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.320]   that that's the sole purpose of, of what you're trying to achieve. If it's just somebody, you know,
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.880]   a weekend warrior that wants to keep in shape and look, and look good, I would say, you know,
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.680]   two times a week for a really challenging workout like that, and then flex the other types of workouts
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.240]   within the week to have more of a, a volume emphasis where you reduce the intensity and you
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.760]   might just look at, you know, larger rep ranges from 12 to 15 to 20, another workout where you're
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.320]   looking at, you know, reducing the volume, but increasing the intensity and really trying to drive,
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.360]   you know, different stimulus to, to give you more end points of, of, of success.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.480]   Mm-hmm. Last time I was here at the UFC Performance Institute, we had a brief conversation and I,
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.520]   I want to make sure I got the details right, that in the short term, and a big increase
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.640]   in stress hormone can lead to an increase in testosterone, like a, like a parachute jump.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.120]   Correct.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:13.800]   Um, but, so stress can promote the release of testosterone.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.160]   That was news to me.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:15.560]   Right.
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.120]   Um, we always hear about stress suppressing testosterone, stress suppressing the immune system,
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.760]   all these terrible things, but in the short term, you're saying it can actually increase the
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.200]   release of testosterone. Uh, so I have that right?
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:28.680]   Correct.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.240]   Okay. And so then the second question is,
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:38.440]   does my cognitive interpretation of the stressor make a difference? In other words,
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:44.120]   if I voluntarily jump out of a plane with a parachute, does it have a different effect on my
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.680]   testosterone than if you shoved me out of the plane against my will? Well, presumably with a parachute.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.240]   Right.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:55.560]   I mean, so, so this was what all my PhD work was, was looking at was the, um, you know,
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:03.160]   the, the, uh, pre, um, the, the exposure to a stressor and the pre arousal of how your body
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.640]   essentially prepares for that stressor and then how it manages it throughout the exposure to the stress.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.680]   We use the resistance training protocol that, that these athletes knew was going to be very,
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.080]   very challenging. It's going to be, there's going to have some anxiety to doing it. They knew there
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.800]   were going to be some physical distress from doing it. Um, and therefore, you know, them,
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.960]   their mindset of how they were going to approach that was already set. So what we saw prior,
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:32.520]   prior, 15 minutes prior to the, the start of an ex exposure to, to the workout, the, the epinephrine,
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.000]   the neuroadrenaline, the adrenaline was already starting to prepare the body sympathetically,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.400]   um, to go into what it knew was going to be a very, very challenging workout.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.360]   So what's the, what was the takeaway there? Is, is the stress good for performance or is it harmful?
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.080]   That's a great question. From my data, certainly the, the greater the arousal, the higher the
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.640]   performance was from a, from a physical exertion perspective. There's definitely a bio,
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:01.240]   an individual biokinetics to some of these, um, hormonal kind of releases in as much as
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:06.680]   those guys that had the highest, um, you know, adreneric response in terms of epinephrine release,
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:13.640]   norepinephrine release also sustained force output, um, through, for a longer period of the workout
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:20.360]   than those that didn't. So the, the, the individuals that had a lower, um, stimulus of, of the sympathetic
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.200]   arousal, let's say, um, certainly didn't perform as well throughout the workout.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:30.840]   There's another side to this, um, that I want to ask about, which is, um, the use of cold, um,
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:36.760]   in particular things like ice baths, cold showers, in theory, that's stress also it's epinephrine.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.800]   And so, um, how should one think about the use of cold for recovery?
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:48.440]   You know, throwing your body into, you know, a cold tub, an ice bath or whatever it may be, um, certainly
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:54.280]   is going to have a physiological stress response. Now people are using that for different end, end
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.200]   goals. And again, I think that's where the narrative has to be explained. Um, if you are using the stress
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:07.640]   specifically to manage the mindset, um, to use it as a specific stress stimulus, that's the same as me
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.920]   doing six by 10, 80%, you know, you, you're just trying to find something to disrupt the system,
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:19.720]   to do something that's very, um, if want a better term, painful, discomfort, whatever. Um, you're just
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:25.880]   finding a stressor and then being able to manage the mindset. But if you're using cold, um, specifically
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:33.160]   from a physiological perspective to promote, um, you know, redistribution of vascularity, you know,
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.880]   of blood flow, you know, to, to different vascular areas of, of muscle that, that you feel have gone
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.680]   through a workout that are damaged or whatever it may be. I think there's, we've got to understand what
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.600]   that stress mechanism is. Um, and you know, the, the data, the literature is certainly still out there
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:55.240]   with respect to cryotherapy and cold baths and some of these, um, you know, high, these, these cold
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.120]   exposures in terms of what they do at the, at the level of the muscle tissue. If that's, if that's the
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:05.800]   target, if you're trying to promote a flushing mechanism or you're trying to promote redistribution
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.920]   of, of the blood flow, what you've got to understand is that cold is going to clamp down every part of the
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:17.720]   vascular system. Um, and we've really got to understand how the muscle would be redistributed, um,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:23.960]   two areas of interest. So, you know, I think the stress response is, is, is, is a real thing with
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:30.280]   respect to, you know, cold exposure. Um, but I think the narrative around what are you using the cold
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:36.440]   for has to precede the conversation. And cold I've heard can actually prevent
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:43.400]   some of the beneficial effects of training that it can actually get, get in the way of muscle growth,
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   et cetera. Yeah. There's, there's, there's some pretty robust data out there now showing
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.280]   that it definitely has an influence on performance variables like strength and power in particular.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:58.280]   Um, but absolutely in terms of muscle hypertrophy and there's a big kind of theme in, in the world
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:04.840]   of athletic performance right now, in terms of periodization of cold exposure as, as a recovery
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:11.080]   modality, you know, what, when do you use cold, you know, should you be using cold for recovery
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.680]   in periods of high training load when you're actually pursuing, you know, it might be general
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:20.440]   proprietary work. We actually trying to pursue muscle growth. Well, that's usually where you get the most
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.320]   sore. It's usually where, you know, you, you feel the most fatigued, but it's probably not the most
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:30.040]   beneficial approach to use an ice bath in that, in that scenario, because you're dampening, you're
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:36.360]   dulling the, you know, the mTOR pathway and, and the, the hyper, hypertrophic, um, signaling pathway.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:42.360]   Whereas in a competition phase where actually quality of exercise and quality of execution of
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:48.440]   skill and technical work has to be maintained, you want to throw the kitchen sink of recovery,
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.640]   uh, capabilities and recovery interventions in that scenario, because you now, you know, the,
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.840]   the muscle building activity should be in the bank. That should have been done in the,
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:02.520]   in the general preparatory work. And, um, now you're focusing on technical execution. So
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.720]   you're absolutely right. That's interesting. So if I, if I understand correctly, uh, if,
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:14.520]   if I want to maximize muscle growth or power or, you know, improvements and adaptations,
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.800]   then the inflammation response, the delayed onset muscle soreness, all the stuff that's uncomfortable
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:25.240]   and that we hear is so terrible is actually the stimulus for adaptation. And so using cold in that
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.920]   situation might short circuit my progress, but if I'm, uh, you know, I don't know that I'll ever do
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:36.600]   this, but if I were to do an Ironman or something or run a marathon under those conditions, I'm basically
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:42.760]   coming to the, to the race, so to speak with all the power and strength I'm going to have. And so they're
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.160]   reducing inflammation is good because it's going to allow me to perform more work essentially.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.920]   Absolutely. Yeah. You have to be strategic about when you use some of these interventions and, you know,
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.600]   the, the time when you're preparing for a competition is the appropriate time when you
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:02.440]   want to drive recovery and make sure that your body is optimized. Um, you know, when you're far away from
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:08.280]   a, a, a competition, you know, dates or, you know, out of season or whatever it may be, and you're really
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:14.440]   trying to just tear up the body a little bit to allow it to its natural, um, you know, healing and
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.480]   adaptation processes to take place. Well, you don't want to negate that, you know, you want the body to
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.440]   optimize its internal recovery and that's how muscle growth is going to happen. So, so interesting that
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.600]   there's a time kind of consideration that you need to make with these interventions for sure.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.640]   At the UFC performance center, are the, are the fighters periodizing their cold exposure or are they
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.160]   just you doing cold, cold at, at, at will?
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:43.080]   Well, it's not just the UFC. And again, I, I talk about my personal experiences with different sports. I think
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:49.880]   just education around where science is at and our understanding of, of concepts like the use of cold
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.920]   exposure for recovery, ice bath, you know, everyone wants to jump in an ice bath. But I think as we've,
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:00.040]   as we've stepped back and scientists have start to say, have started to figure out and look at some of the
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.720]   data, you know, we're now more intuitive about, well, actually that might not be the best or the most
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.760]   optimal approach. And I think that's, that's any given sport. So yes, certainly here at the, at the UFC,
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.040]   we're trying to educate our athletes around, you know, appropriate timing. And it's the same with
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.280]   nutrition. It's the same with an ice bath intervention. It's the same with lifting weights.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.360]   It's the same with going for a run or working out on the bike. You know, the, the, there's, there's
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:29.400]   tactics to when, when you do things and when you don't do things. And I think, you know, stress and,
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.520]   and cold exposure, um, we have to have a consideration around that as well, but it's not just, you know,
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:41.240]   MMA fighters, that's any, any athlete. And I think it's the, the best, the best professionals,
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:46.040]   the most successful professionals do that really well. They understand, they listen, number one,
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:51.480]   they, they educate themselves and then they build structure. And I think, you know, at the most elite
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.360]   level, we, we always talk about it here at the UFC, but the most elite level, you're not necessarily
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:02.280]   training harder than anybody else. Everybody in the UFC trains hard. Like everyone is training
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:07.880]   super hard, but the best athletes, the, the true elite levels are the ones that can do it again and
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:13.160]   again and again on a daily basis and sustain a technical output for skill development. Therefore,
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:18.200]   their skills can improve or physical development, their physical attributes can improve. So that ability
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:25.000]   to reproduce on a day-to-day basis falls into a recovery conversation. Now, when is the right time to
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.200]   use something like an ice bath and when isn't, is part of the, the high performance conversation for
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:37.880]   sure. For somebody that wants to get better at sport, do you recommend a particularly long or short
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:44.840]   training session? It does intensity matter or is it just reps? No, it's, it's not a volume driven
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:52.280]   exercise. It's a quality driven exercise. It is about rehearsal of accurate movement, accurate movement
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:59.720]   mechanics. And the soon, as soon as that becomes impacted by fatigue or inaccurate movement, you're
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:05.000]   now losing the, the, the motor learning. You're losing the accuracy of the skill that, you know,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.800]   people can call it muscle memory or whatever they want, right? But essentially you're grooving neural
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.080]   axons to, to create movement patterns and they're situational throughout sport, right? You know,
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.480]   whether it's a Cruyff turn in soccer or a jump shot in basketball or a forehand down the line,
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:25.720]   you can carve out that particular posture and position and skill, and you can isolate it and
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:32.120]   you can drill it again and again, again. Now, as soon as fatigue is, is influencing that repetition,
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:38.280]   it's time, it's time to stop. And the best coaches understand that it's shorter sessions that are very
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:44.360]   high quality. And I think the best athletes in my experience are the ones that consciously and
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:51.800]   cognitively are aware of it at every moment of the training session, a three hour session versus a 90
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.360]   minute session. You know, we'll, we'll take the 90 minute session any day when it comes to skill
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.720]   acquisition, because that's going to be driven by quality over quantity.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:06.920]   Yeah. Training and skill learning is incredibly mentally fatiguing. You hit a really hard workout
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:12.440]   or run early in the day. What leads to the mental fatigue after physical performance?
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.760]   If you have an amazing coach who is setting up training in a particular way, it's challenging.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.120]   There's a strain related to it. And I'm not talking physical strain, I'm talking
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.560]   figuring things out, you know, figuring out the skill. And I think that can be stressful. Like,
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.480]   you know, if they hit the right technique, you know, that reward center in the brain,
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.680]   that dopamine shot is going to fly up there. And there's only so many times that we can get
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:39.240]   that before that becomes dampened. And I think there's an energetic piece to it. You know, there's
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:46.920]   the fueling of the brain. There's the carbohydrate fueling exercise that actually the strategy around
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:52.680]   how you fuel for learning and fuel for physical training is actually pretty similar.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.600]   Yeah, it's glucose. It's sugar at the end of the day, right?
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:03.240]   Do you think that nutrition that doesn't include a lot of glucose, doesn't include a lot of carbohydrates,
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.480]   is a problem?
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:12.920]   Yeah. Again, disclaimer, I'm not a dietitian. But I think it comes down to metabolic efficiency. You know,
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:19.720]   we rarely advocate a high performance athlete in a high intensity intermittent sport like MMA,
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   being totally ketogenic. Because at the end of the day, some of those high intensity
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:30.840]   efforts usually require, you know, carbohydrate fueling for the high and the energy,
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.960]   the energy is produced at those high intensities.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:39.560]   Can I interrupt you real quick? What about ketones for people that are ingesting carbohydrates?
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.640]   This is an interesting area because people always hear ketones and they think, oh, I have to be ketogenic
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:49.640]   to benefit from taking ketones. But there are a number of athletes and recreational athletes now,
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:57.400]   as well, taking liquid or powder based ketones, even though they do eat rice and oatmeal and bread and
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:04.680]   other things. So are there any known benefits of ketones, even if one is not in a state of ketosis?
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:10.440]   The use of ketones that I'm primarily aware of is in our sport is after the event, you know,
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.080]   in terms of the brain health with athletes that take, you know, potentially taking trauma to the brain,
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.680]   et cetera, and looking to maintain the fueling and the energy supply to the brain. But yes,
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.680]   it's probably a little bit out of my remit. So I don't want to talk on that because I'm not,
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   I'm not fully familiar with that. And to come back to the original question, if it's a,
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:33.080]   you know, general population, then yes, I think there's, there's a place to argue that actually
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.800]   being on a ketogenic diet at times, and maybe that's a cycling exercise, maybe not, you know,
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:44.280]   I don't mean cycling a bike, I mean cycling ketosis is beneficial because I think it's going to lead
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:50.120]   to better metabolic management and metabolic efficiency. Those lower intensities where we should
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:57.400]   be fueling our, our metabolism with lipids and fats. Clearly the, the Western diet and, you know,
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:02.840]   the modern day diet is heavily driven by processed foods and carbohydrates that, you know, people
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:11.000]   become predisposed to utilization of that fuel source, um, above lipids use, fat use, um, intensities
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.120]   that are very low. So, you know, some of our data with the fighters shows that as well. Um, but I think
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:21.880]   the challenge for us is that we're working with a clientele that require high intensity bouts of effort.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.120]   Um, so, you know, fueling appropriately, um, is very important for that.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:31.720]   Now we use, we use tactics here where we essentially have athletes on what you would
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:38.520]   say kind of a, is it a largely a ketogenic diet, but then we will fuel carbohydrates around
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:44.120]   training sessions. So we'll do very timed exposure to carbohydrates. So it's not post-training,
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:49.640]   post-training, immediately pre during, and then immediately post. And then the rest of their diets,
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:55.320]   you know, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, uh, what would look like ketogenic type approaches. So we're
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:00.920]   trying to be very tactical in the exposure to maximize the intensity for the training, um,
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   and then return to a metabolically efficient diet, which is heavily reduced in carbohydrate
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.800]   because we've fueled the, the, the sessions that need it.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:15.240]   The way I understand metabolic efficiency is that you're, you teach the body to use
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:22.200]   fats by maybe doing long, long bouts of cardio, maybe lowering carbohydrates a bit. So teaching
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:27.560]   the body to tap into its fat stores for certain periods of training. And then you also teach the
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.840]   body to utilize carbohydrates by supplying carbohydrates immediately after training and before training. You
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.000]   teach the body to use ketones, and then you use them at the appropriate time, as opposed to just
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.880]   deciding that one of these fuel sources is good and all the others are bad or dispensable. Do I have
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:47.960]   that correct? Yes, you're absolutely right. I mean, at low intensities of exercise or just day-to-day
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:54.200]   living, we shouldn't be tapping into our, um, carbohydrate fuel sources extensively. That that's,
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:00.200]   that's for higher intensity work or, you know, the fight or flight needs of, of stress, you know? Um,
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:07.240]   if, you know, athletes or any individual has a, you know, a high carbohydrate diet, they're going to
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:13.160]   start to become predisposed to utilizing that fuel source preferentially. Now, at low intensity,
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:19.240]   that can be problematic, certainly for an athlete, because if they preferentially use carbohydrate at
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:24.200]   lower intensities, when the, when the exercise demand goes to a higher intensity, they've already
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:29.000]   exhausted their fuel stores. You know, they can't draw upon fat because the oxidization of that,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.200]   that fat is just too slow. So they're essentially now become fatigued, um, because they've already
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:39.400]   utilized the carbohydrate stores. So what we tried to do, yes, through diet manipulation and a little
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.760]   bit of exercise manipulation is, as you say, teach the body or train the body to preferentially use a
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.400]   specific fuel source, fat, obviously at lower intensities and carbohydrate at high intensities.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:54.600]   And we look at specifically the crossover point between the two tells a lot in terms of how an
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.520]   athlete is, is ultimately, um, you know, how their metabolism is working.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.800]   I think most people are looking for that one pattern of eating, that one pattern of exercising,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:10.200]   that's going to be best for them or sustain them. And they often look back to the time when they felt
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:15.240]   so much better switching from one thing to the next, but the adaptation process itself is also key,
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:22.200]   right? Teaching the body. And I, um, so if we were to, um, just riff on this just a little bit further,
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.920]   if somebody is eating in a particular way and they want to try this kind of periodization
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:32.520]   of nutrition, um, could one say, okay, for a few weeks, I'm going to do more high intensity interval
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.800]   training and weight training, and I'm going to eat a bit more carbohydrate because I'm depleting more
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:42.520]   glycogen. Then if I switch to a phase of my training where I'm doing some longer runs, maybe I'm not, maybe I'm
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:47.000]   training less, maybe I'm just working at my desk a little bit more, then I might switch to a lower
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.800]   carbohydrate diet. Do I have that right? And then if I'm going to enter a competition of some sort,
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:59.000]   certainly not UFC or MMA of any kind to be clear, uh, not because it isn't a wonderful sport, but because
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.920]   it's a, that wouldn't be good for my other profession. But, um, if I were going to do that, then I would think about
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:10.360]   stacking carbohydrates, ketones and, and fats. Is that, do I have that more or less right?
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.360]   I mean, I think, yeah, you said it eloquently. At the end of the day, you're consciously
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:21.960]   understanding what the, um, the exposure to, to physical exertion is, and you're flexing your diet
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.920]   accordingly. A couple more questions. I, I can't help myself. I know we talked about temperature earlier.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:33.320]   I have to ask you about heat. One of the reasons to deliberately expose oneself to heat is for things like
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.680]   growth hormone release, et cetera. We can talk about this, but how does one get better at heat
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.840]   adaptation? Or at least what are you doing with the fighters to get them better at dealing with heat,
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.840]   barring like hyperthermia and death? Like, I mean, obviously you heat up the brain too much. People
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:53.400]   will have seizures and die, but, um, you lose neurons, but, uh, what's the right way to acclimate heat?
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:59.240]   Yeah. So we, we, we normally start with about 15 minutes of exposure. Now, if someone's really lacking
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.480]   acclimation to heat, you know, you can do that in three, five minute efforts. Do you know what I
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.240]   mean? And actually take this hot, hot sauna. Yeah. Hot sauna. Take time to step out.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:12.840]   200 degrees or something. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. 200 Fahrenheit. Yes. Um, and we, we, we try to work
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:19.640]   up to 30 to 40 minutes to 45 minutes in the sauna continuous. Now we, we have to understand, you know,
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:26.600]   what, what's the advantage of heat acclimation for our athletes? Ultimately their ability to sweat and to lose,
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:32.680]   you know, body fluids is going to be advantageous to their weight cut process. So their ability to
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.560]   make weight, it is a technique that these guys, some of these guys adopt. So if you don't have,
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:42.440]   you know, high sweat rates, it means you're going to have to sit in the sauna for longer and longer and
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:49.160]   longer to get the same delta in sweat release. Um, so the more acclimated you are, the more your body
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:54.600]   is thermogenic genetically adapted, the more sweat glands you have. So, you know, we start with 15 minutes
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.320]   and then we just try to add on and add on across the time. And now, now for us, we kind of found
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:05.560]   about 14, um, sauna exposures starts to really then drive the adaptations that we're looking for.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:11.160]   So it's not a quick fix, you know, a heat acclimation strategy has to happen long before
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:15.640]   fight week or long before the fights. You know, this is a, this is a process that has to begin,
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.440]   you know, eight to 10 weeks before the fight so that we can actually get that adaptation and that
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.560]   tolerance to the stressor, to the exposure of heat.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:27.320]   This is interesting. I, until today, when we were talking about this earlier and again, now,
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:34.440]   I didn't realize that, um, but it makes perfect sense now that I hear it, that heat adaptation is
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.280]   possible, that you're basically can train the body to become better at cooling itself,
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.160]   which is what, what sweating is.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:45.720]   The body is, uh, you know, as an organism, as an organic system, it's, it's hugely adaptable.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:51.080]   It's hugely plastic. But I think the skill is understanding the whens, the whys and the where
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:57.720]   ofs in terms of changing the overload, changing the stimulus to drive specific adaptation. And
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:03.640]   philosophically, that's, that's how we go about our work here. We talk about adaptation led programming.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:09.240]   Now adaptation led programming fits into every single category, not just lifting weights or
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:14.360]   running track. It fits into nutrition. It fits into sitting in the sauna. It fits into being in
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:20.040]   a cold bath or not. It fits into so many different things because we're driven by scientific insights.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.760]   And that's how we really want to go about our business.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:28.040]   If someone wanted to experiment with heat adaptation or experiment with cold adaptation or change up their
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:34.680]   training regimen or, or diet and look at metabolic efficiency, do you think, um, 12 weeks is a good
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:40.360]   period of time to really give something a thorough go and get and gain an understanding of how well or how
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:44.040]   poorly something works for oneself? Or would you say eight is enough for three?
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:50.920]   For 99% of things that change within the body that physiologically adapt to a training stimulus or an overload
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:55.720]   stimulus, you're going to start to see either regression or progression, um, you know,
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.000]   beneficial or detrimental effects within three months. Absolutely.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.040]   I would say, and I think, you know, the individual interpretation is always has to be considered.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:09.160]   And I think that's where it comes back to, to be a thinking man's athlete or be a thinking man's
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:15.800]   trainer, like someone that's going through exercise. Don't you have to cognitive consciously
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.480]   understand where your body's at any moment in time. You know, you've got to be real with yourself.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.880]   You create a journal, create a log of your training, create a log of your feelings, your subjective
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:28.520]   feedback of, um, you know, how you felt, your mood, your sleep, your athletes do that.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.760]   Yeah. Yeah. We, we, we try to promote that because again, that's, that's part of this,
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:37.720]   this process, you know, um, maybe 12 weeks for you, but I might get the same responses in eight,
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:44.680]   eight weeks. You know, we could put 15 guys on the mat and give them the same workout. And there's
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:51.640]   going to be 15 different responses to that same workout because the human organism is so complex
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:56.520]   and in nature that it's going to adapt differently. You know, some people will tolerate it. Some people
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.920]   are going to be challenged by it. Some people have got a metabolic makeup that's going to promote it. Some
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:05.240]   people are meta metabolically challenged by it. You know, there's, there's just so many different
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:10.600]   things that we have to consider. And that's what we try to do here. It's the cross we bear is that we try to
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.840]   understand on an individual level, how to optimize athletic performance.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:20.920]   Duncan, when you speak, I learn so much. I I'm going to take the protocols that I've heard
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.200]   about today. I'm going to think about how I'm training and how I could train differently and
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:30.040]   better how I'm eating, how I could eat different differently and better for sake of performance.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:36.040]   And just in, in general, um, thank you so much for your time, your scientific expertise,
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:40.920]   the stuff you're doing in the practical realm. It's, it's immense. So, uh, hopefully, uh, we can do
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:45.080]   it again. Yes. Thank you. This has been a blast. I appreciate it. And, uh, yeah, keep doing what
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.760]   you're doing because I know there's a lot of people out there that love the platform. So thanks for the
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:56.440]   invite. It's been awesome. Oh, thank you. Thanks so much. All right.
