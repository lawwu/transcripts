[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.000]   At DesiringGod.org, we believe in the sovereignty of God
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.760]   and we believe it because we see it in scripture.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.520]   And not only do we believe in God's sovereignty
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.560]   over all things, but we celebrate it.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.240]   And we also field important questions
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.320]   about what all this means for our own lives today.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.780]   Today's question is short and simple,
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.180]   but it's pretty profound and it comes
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.320]   from a podcast listener named Zena, who writes this,
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.440]   "Pastor John, did God elect me because He loves me
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.160]   or does He love me because He elected me?"
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.120]   How would you answer Zena?
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.120]   - Like so many questions, this one almost answers itself
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.520]   as soon as we define our terms,
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.320]   or as soon as we, in this case,
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.360]   clarify what these two questions mean.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.320]   In fact, the reason I think this question
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.320]   is worthy of answering is precisely to clarify the terms
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.560]   because if the terms are given certain meanings,
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.440]   very wrong teachings can emerge.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.160]   For example, someone might ask the question,
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.160]   did God elect me, that is, choose me for Himself
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.840]   because He loves me, assuming that God saw something
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.280]   lovable in me and then was inclined to me on that basis,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.240]   and then because of that inclination towards me
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.480]   and my peculiar value that He recognizes,
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.080]   He chose me as part of His family.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.080]   Now, that would be a dreadfully wrong picture.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.100]   God is surveying humanity and all the people out there
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.960]   to see who's worthy of His adoption,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.000]   people who have the necessary qualifications
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.440]   to be chosen out of a fallen and condemned humanity.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.760]   That's not the picture of the New Testament.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.200]   And as soon as we clarify that,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.920]   the answer starts to become clearer.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.520]   Or someone might ask, does He love me
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.520]   because He elected me, assuming that God in His choosing
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.640]   is somehow emotionally neutral or indifferent
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.400]   and that His choice of us is at the very beginning
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.000]   maybe begrudging or without any heart or any joy,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.480]   and then only after He has collected His elected ones
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.760]   with no delight in the election,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.320]   He somehow comes to love them because He elected them.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.120]   That too, it seems to me, would be a dreadfully wrong
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.080]   impression from the New Testament.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.760]   So let's look at a few passages
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.340]   to see if we can get clarity from the words of Scripture
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.320]   about the relationship between election and love.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.240]   The picture of election of God's people
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.560]   in the Old Testament goes like this.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.680]   Deuteronomy 7, 6, following,
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.680]   "The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.240]   for His treasured possession
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.400]   out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.800]   It was not because you were more in number
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   than any other people that the Lord set His love on you
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.240]   and chose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples,
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.040]   but it is because the Lord loves you."
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.320]   So Moses mentions election and love,
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   but he doesn't prescribe or describe a sequence.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.080]   And in fact, it reads as though the terms
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.480]   are almost virtually interchangeable.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.480]   The Lord your God has chosen you to be a people, why?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.280]   It is because you were loved.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.120]   That is, He chose you.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.640]   You can't force a temporal sequence out of the phrase,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   "Set His love on you and chose you,"
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.160]   any more than you can make a temporal sequence
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.560]   out of the statement, "I made my vows to you
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.360]   and I married you."
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.960]   In choosing them, He loved them.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.880]   In loving them, He chooses them.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.600]   His loving was His choosing.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.560]   His choosing was His loving.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.880]   Now, if I'm on the right track here,
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.800]   let's see if that's confirmed in the New Testament.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.640]   1 Thessalonians 1, verse 4 says,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.640]   "We know, brothers, loved by God, that He has chosen you."
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.400]   As if perhaps seeing that they are loved
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.640]   is evidence of a prior election.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.000]   But then it flips in Romans 11, 5,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.080]   and we read, "So too at the present time
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.080]   there is a remnant according to the election of grace."
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.880]   As if, perhaps, election came from a prior act
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.040]   of grace or love.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.240]   Or we read in Ephesians 1, 4,
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.920]   "He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.040]   that we should be holy and blameless before Him.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.640]   In love, He predestined us for adoption
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.200]   to Himself as sons."
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.040]   So it looks essentially the same.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.280]   In election, He predestined us,
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.080]   and in love, He predestined us.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.440]   Or chapter 9, verse 11 to 13,
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.720]   we read about the election of Jacob over Esau
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.200]   before they had been born, done anything good or evil,
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.720]   and nothing in either of them
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.360]   to attract God's preference of one over the other.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.800]   And so it goes like this,
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.440]   "Though they were not yet born
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.720]   and had done nothing good or bad,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   in order that God's purpose of election might continue,
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.520]   not because of works, but because of Him who calls,
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.280]   He was told, 'The older will serve the younger,'
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.160]   as it is written, 'Jacob I loved.'
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.880]   But Esau I hated."
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.600]   So the words, "Jacob I loved,"
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.760]   it seems to me to stand virtually in the place of,
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.440]   "Jacob I chose before they were born
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.080]   or had done anything good or evil."
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.720]   One more text, and I think this one provides a phrase
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.120]   that may help us get the balance we need
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   in relating these two important realities
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.120]   of love and election.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.240]   Here's Romans 11:28.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.440]   Paul says about the Jewish people,
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.000]   "According to the gospel,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   they are enemies for your sake, the Gentiles' sake.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.600]   But according to election,
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.400]   they are loved for the sake of their forefathers."
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.400]   Now the phrase, "According to election, they are loved,"
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.760]   says being loved accords with election.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.560]   It doesn't say which comes first or which causes the other.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.560]   It simply says they accord, they fit together perfectly.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.240]   They always go together in accordance.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.240]   So my conclusion is that election is the act of God
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:59.640]   as He foresees a fallen world of undeserving sinners.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.240]   And for Christ's sake, I say that on the basis of,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.400]   Ephesians 1:5, "For Christ's sake,
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.000]   He sets His love on some in total freedom,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.760]   guided only by His hidden counsels."
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.960]   And I can't see any warrant in the Bible
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   for separating sequentially God's love for
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.040]   and His choosing of whom He will save.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.020]   There's no election that is not loving,
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:39.020]   and there's no primal initiating loving that is not electing.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:46.240]   To say that electing is not based on loving,
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.000]   which is what I'm arguing we should not say,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.360]   to say that electing is not based on loving
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.000]   protects us from the possible misunderstanding
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.800]   that we are chosen because of something lovely in us.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   And to say that loving is not based on electing
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.720]   protects us from the misunderstanding
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.880]   that God's choosing was somehow heartless
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.960]   or emotionally neutral.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.960]   And to say both of these should fill every child of God
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:25.880]   with both a sense of utter unworthiness
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.520]   and utter amazement that God took delight
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.000]   in making us His own.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.080]   - Amen, may God work these truths deep into our hearts.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.520]   There's such an infinite depth of awe here
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.120]   to uncover throughout the years, throughout the millennia.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.360]   Thank you, Pastor John and Zena.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.400]   Thank you for the simple but really thoughtful question
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.240]   that you sent in to us.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.720]   It's short and simple and clear and to the point.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.920]   Super helpful.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.440]   Thanks for listening and making the podcast
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.160]   part of your day and a part of your commute.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.960]   I know a lot of you listen to or from work.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.520]   And three times a week we publish.

[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.080]   you may be facing about how God's sovereignty
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.160]   relates to your life.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.480]   You can do all of that through our online home
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.200]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.140]   Well, marriage is a precious gift from God.
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.960]   But when does marriage move from being a precious gift
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.960]   from God into a false god, an idol of personal security?
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.880]   It's a really important question.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.360]   And it's a sharply worded question from a listener
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.340]   who lives in France.
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.400]   And it's on the table Friday when we return.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.440]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.920]   A long time author and pastor, John Piper.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.880]   We'll see you then.
