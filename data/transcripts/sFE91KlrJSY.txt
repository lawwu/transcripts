[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920]   Question from Natalia.
[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.400]   You've mentioned that one way to answer the question,
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.320]   what makes a good life good is to turn to biographies
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.720]   of people whose life you admire.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.200]   Who do you personally admire?
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.640]   - Well, I have a lot of answers to that question,
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.400]   but why don't I just give you one example
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.640]   of someone I admire and that admiration has been developed
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.820]   and nuanced through the reading of biographies.
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.880]   And one of my classic examples there is Abraham Lincoln,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.180]   real influence on me.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.640]   I'm actually reading John Meacham's new biography
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.520]   of Lincoln and there was light.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.400]   So I'm about halfway through that.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.220]   I'm enjoying that one.
[00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.520]   I've read a lot of Lincoln books,
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.320]   but that one is ranking pretty high up so far.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.360]   So I like what he's doing there.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.360]   All right, so here's the two things I learned about Lincoln
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.400]   through going deep through biographical material
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.240]   that makes him someone I admire.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.840]   One is the fact that Lincoln was a moral being.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.000]   I wanna be really clear about what I mean by that.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.960]   I don't mean that in the sense that he was a superlative
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.400]   example of morality that even by 21st century standards,
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.520]   we look back at everything he did or think and said,
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.640]   wow, he had found some sort of crystalline, pure morality.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.600]   He had broken free from any sort of parochial
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.200]   or cultural influences and just saw
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.680]   the abstract platonic light of the perfect moral sentiments.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.360]   It's not that his morality was at a very high polished
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.160]   plane, but that he saw his morality
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.680]   as an important part of his life.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.600]   And he worked on it explicitly throughout his life.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.800]   He is a moral being.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.680]   What you get out of reading his biographies
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.480]   is the degree to which he thought that maintaining
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.720]   and evolving his sense of principles
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.520]   and living his life by them was a key project
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.480]   of a life well lived.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.920]   A good book that really looks at this
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.800]   is William Lee Miller's "Lincoln's Virtues."
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.920]   Miller, it's a moral biography or an ethical biography,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.600]   I think he calls it, of Lincoln.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.280]   And he goes through just the development
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.720]   of how Lincoln repeatedly would interrogate
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.040]   his own underlying principles and evolve them
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.520]   and grow them and nuance them and then let that then
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.600]   speak back to what he was doing in his life
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.280]   and in his political career.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.840]   That's what I think was important.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.960]   He thought that was key.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.600]   I am more impressed by someone who throughout their life
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.040]   really cares about, struggles with, and tries to evolve
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.800]   and live by a evolving empathetic moral code
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.280]   than I am by someone who maybe has, in isolation,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.960]   the better moral beliefs but came by it easy.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.520]   That they were born at a time where it was
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.440]   just really obvious.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.920]   And in fact, if you had a different belief,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.240]   someone would yell at you anyways.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.520]   There's no strain there.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.200]   It's the life interrogated.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.320]   That's really rare.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.520]   And he really did that.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.560]   All right, number two, the other thing I've learned
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.920]   about Lincoln, why I admire him,
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.320]   is the fact that he has a purposive intelligence.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.800]   P-U-R-P-O-S-I-V-E.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.560]   I think it was actually William Lee Miller
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.920]   who used that term in talking about Lincoln.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.440]   What that means by purposive intelligence
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.720]   was he had a brain that worked and he put this brain
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.240]   to work to try to impact the world in positive ways.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.960]   He saw his brain as an asset and systematically
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.160]   developed this asset to try to get a return out of it,
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.440]   and a particular return in terms of making
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.080]   a positive impact on the world.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   It really is an amazing story how this kid,
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.360]   growing up in the depths of early 19th century
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.320]   American poverty, just on the strength of his brain alone,
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.000]   emerged out of this context, backwater Kentucky,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.040]   barely literate father, dead mother, single father,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.400]   barely literate, who had him just doing
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.220]   the harshest of manual labors, suspicious of book learning,
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.520]   renting him out to other people for just labor
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.200]   for these other people, you don't get to keep the money.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.040]   Lincoln hated that.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.520]   He emerged from that just off of the strength
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.160]   of his brain, which he developed,
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.680]   and he knew there was something there,
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.920]   and he developed that and applied it.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.080]   All of his impact comes from the very careful
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.800]   cultivation of this intelligence.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   You look at his debates with Stephen Douglas.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   It's a masterclass in just working through
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.840]   clarity and thinking.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.460]   Look at his Cooper Union address as he's building up
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.320]   to his potential nomination for the president in 1860.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.860]   You see here, again, a masterclass in weeks,
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.400]   if not months, of research into the history of the country,
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.820]   building step by step these incredibly logical arguments.
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.520]   You have to understand how unique this was in its time.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.560]   The great rhetoricians of the 19th century were pompous,
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.380]   and it was emotional.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.840]   It was a lot of classical allusions,
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.640]   a lot of Cicero being quoted, and a lot of personal,
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.780]   vindictive, or emotional appeals.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.800]   It was a lot of trying to get people fired up
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.480]   by appealing and inflaming their passions,
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.400]   and there's a lot of ad hominem going on,
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.080]   and then trying to establish your intelligence.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.000]   You look at all these different books I can cite.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.240]   Lincoln came in and said, "I'm gonna be logical
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.300]   "and incredibly plain spoken.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.980]   "I'm gonna step by step, like the lawyer he was,
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.140]   "bring you through why the Nebraska Act
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.060]   "is actually against the founder's intentions,
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.000]   "why this would be devastating to the country."
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.280]   Taking down his anti-slavery arguments
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.740]   were not like you would get more
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.840]   from maybe the William Lloyd Garrison,
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.320]   not barn burners, but we're gonna go A to B to C to E,
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.280]   and when we get to F, it's clear that this makes no sense.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.720]   That was an incredibly effective rhetorical strategy.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.580]   It's all based off of purposive intelligence,
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.000]   and it made a massive difference.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.180]   It was why he got nominated for the Republican ticket,
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.860]   was because he had built this reputation of,
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.300]   he's not out there inflaming people,
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.900]   he's not out there in the 1860 equivalent of Twitter
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.220]   trying to score points for his team.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.660]   It's this incredible reasonableness and logic,
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.540]   and there's a moderatism that actually,
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.820]   that's what worked, that's what worked.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.060]   That's what led to the 13th Amendment.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.300]   So to me, that was a big inspiration.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.900]   The way that he cultivated an intelligence
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.940]   to effect change, very systematic.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.020]   A good book for that,
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.860]   so I'm kind of giving book recommendations around the way,
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.380]   John Stauffer from Harvard, his book "Giants".
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.620]   What it does, and it's interesting,
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.420]   is he takes Frederick Douglass and Lincoln.
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.700]   Here's two people who are coming out
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.180]   of impossible situations.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.320]   Douglass' situation, of course, even more impossible,
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.480]   being an Eastern Shore slave on the Eastern Shore.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.600]   Lincoln, of course, was not a slave,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.080]   but they were both coming out of these
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.720]   impossible circumstances, and they both,
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.000]   this is what Stauffer really characterizes,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.240]   is through the development of their mind,
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.760]   how they were able to become, in the end, giants,
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.440]   and their lives became very intertwined.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.360]   So that's sort of, giants sort of gets
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.720]   into the intertwining of the lives
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.540]   of Frederick Douglass and Lincoln.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.800]   So they kind of have these parallel emergences,
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.160]   all about taking these minds, cultivating them,
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.720]   and then putting them systematically
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.000]   towards what they thought was important uses,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.200]   and then their lives end up becoming quite intertwined.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.640]   They were, at some point,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.360]   at some point, they were almost adversarial.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.520]   So you get Douglass' famous speech
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.520]   on what the Fourth of July means to a former slave,
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.920]   but they come later in life,
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.320]   that Douglass is an incredible supporter, actually,
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.340]   of Lincoln's very systematic approach,
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.340]   and his very functionalist approach,
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.100]   and let's try to actually make change happen,
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.780]   as opposed to making the people on our side
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.780]   as happy as possible.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.380]   And there's a whole interesting story there.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.840]   One more book recommendation, then,
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.060]   if you like that particular line of thinking,
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.420]   H. W. Brown's "Zealot,"
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.380]   which contrasts John Brown and Lincoln,
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.740]   and their approach to antislavery movements.
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.300]   Brown's was very zealous and very pure,
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.940]   and we get a lot of likes on the Twitter,
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.060]   but he ended up not only hung,
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.300]   but actually perhaps even causing issues with the movement.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.300]   Lincoln would not be popular on Twitter,
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.100]   but did get the 13th Amendment.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.460]   So anyways, that's an example, Natalia.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.780]   Lincoln is someone who I grew to admire
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.340]   through reading as much as possible on him,
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.940]   and picking out these very specific things,
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.400]   which I think have a general application,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.340]   are generally relevant to a lot of us.
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:55.060]   Justin, I actually met someone at the live event.
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.500]   - Mike. - Mike.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.300]   Mike gave me a recommendation.
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.820]   I gotta read this book.
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.180]   It's about, this sounds so me,
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.100]   it's Lincoln, Civil War,
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.820]   and the role of technology in the Civil War,
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.220]   and how the telegraph and the railroads,
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.500]   and it was actually these really advanced
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.300]   technological systems were so intertwined
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.560]   with Lincoln's managing of the war.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.060]   I mean, that's kinda hitting all my buttons probably.
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.000]   - How many Lincoln books do you think you've consumed?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.040]   Like 30?
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.540]   - Probably not 30.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.220]   A dozen, I would say.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.840]   - Have you always been a fan?
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.080]   - I came to him through books.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.400]   I came to him through,
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.800]   it was my mother-in-law bought me Lincoln's Virtues,
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.120]   and then Miller wrote another book
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.480]   about Lincoln's time in the White House.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.320]   I read those.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.640]   This would have been grad school.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.640]   And that kinda set me down.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.880]   Then John Stoffer we knew.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.340]   So John Stoffer, when I was at MIT,
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.380]   my wife worked at a nonprofit in Watertown
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.000]   with John's wife, and they did,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.280]   it was an education nonprofit,
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.520]   history education nonprofits.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.920]   Like John, he was always involved and would do events.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.040]   So I remember John Stoffer and Skip Gates from Harvard
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.600]   were always sort of around.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.320]   And so I remember his book signing party for that book.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.000]   So we knew John, just knew him from our time in Cambridge,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.800]   babysat his kids before.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.160]   So then that book also was exposed to around that same time.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.060]   It's a great book.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.300]   (upbeat music)
