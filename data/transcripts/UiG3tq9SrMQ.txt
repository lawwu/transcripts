[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   All right, can you introduce yourself?
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.760]   Hi, my name is Pastor Justin Beer.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.200]   I'm with Masters Bible Church in Vancouver, Washington.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.640]   We are a Grace Advanced Church plant.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.400]   We've been up there about seven years now, and we are really enjoying the conference.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.500]   We actually have a bunch of our guys that come here regularly and make a good men's
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.040]   retreat out of it in a way so that everyone is edified and built up as we seek to build
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.480]   up men in the local body.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.480]   Awesome.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.960]   And how many times have you been at Shepard's Conference?
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.600]   Yeah, this will be my fifth time.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.080]   And you've been reading the LSB.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.080]   What do you think?
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.920]   Yeah, we love the LSB at Masters Bible Church.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.920]   That's what we use.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.640]   That's what we recommend to our congregants.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.440]   And it's just been such a blessing to have that more literal translation, word-for-word,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.480]   and being able to dive into the text and let the reader decide for themselves.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.480]   All right.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.680]   Hey, thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.200]   Appreciate it.
