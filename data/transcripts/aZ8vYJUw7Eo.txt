[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words which are to be found in the book of the prophet Isaiah,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   the 40th chapter, reading this evening from verse 18 to verse 24.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   From verse 18 to verse 24 in the 40th chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   "To whom then will ye liken God, or what likeness will ye compare unto him?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   He seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Have ye not known? Have ye not heard? Hath it not been told you from the beginning?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   that bringeth the princes to nothing. He maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown; yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither; and the whirlwind shall take them away as double.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Now we've been considering this great and magnificent chapter of Isaiah's prophecy for a number of Sunday nights.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And if we are to understand aright and truly the message of this particular section,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   which I've just read to you now, it is essential that we should have in our minds
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   a fairly clear picture of the contents of the chapter as a whole.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   It is of course this great evangelical prophecy, this message that was given here to this prophet Isaiah
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   some 800 years or so before the coming of the Son of God into this world,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   the prophecy of his coming, and of what he'd be like, and what he'd do.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It is a kind of synopsis, as we have seen in our studies of the Christian message and of the Christian faith.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Now all that is stated in the first eleven verses. There it is presented to us in all its glory.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   This astounding proclamation from God to men, that in spite of their sin,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   because God has love and mercy, he has found a way to pardon our sins.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   So that though we deserve punishment and retribution, the message that comes to us in the gospel
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   is one of comfort, is one of peace, and it's all because of what God has done in his only begotten Son.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   The gospel is a revelation to us of God's way of salvation through Jesus Christ his Son.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   The message is, "Behold, you are God."
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   In other words, into the midst of the sin of this world, and the hopelessness and the chaos of men in this world,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   God has sent his own Son, and he has sent him to make and to produce a way of salvation.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   There's never been anything like it, there never will be anything like it.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   It is entirely of God, and it's the greatest good tidings that mankind can ever know.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   So those who believe it are called upon to get them up into the high mountain,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   and to lift up their voice, and to lift it up, and not to be afraid,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   but to proclaim it without fear or favor, and with a holy boldness,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   because it is an account of what God has done for sinful men in Christ Jesus.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   That's the message.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Translating it into practical terms and interpersonal terms for every one of us, it's this,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   that it matters not how sinful a life we may have lived until this very moment,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   it matters not how godless we may have been and how vile in our conduct and behavior,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   however much we may have spurned the vice divine and spat upon the sanctities,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   if we but realize our sin and our condition, and our rich desert of hell and perdition,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   and acknowledge it and confess it to God with humility,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   and turn to him and cast ourselves upon his love,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and believe the message that he will give us as we do so,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   concerning his Son and the way of salvation at this moment without waiting a second.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   All our sins will be forgiven, blotted out as a thick cloud.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   We will be reconciled to God.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   We will be adopted as children into his family.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   He will give us his Spirit in the new nature,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   and he will lead us and guide us, and shower his blessings upon us as our Father,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   and ultimately at the end will receive us unto himself and into everlasting bliss and glory.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   That's the gospel message.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   That is the evangel of the New Testament here foreshadowed, pictured, and prophesied.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   That's the whole message of the New Testament,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   the message that was preached by the apostles,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   the message that has been preached by the Church throughout the running centuries,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   this astounding message.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And yet, you see, we all know full well that we are confronted by this position,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   that the world doesn't believe it,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   that the world is living tonight in the mess and in the main as if this had never happened,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   as if it were not true,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   as if it indeed were nothing but a cunningly devised fable, an idle stall,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   some sort of figment of men's disordered imaginations,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   some kind of fantasy worked up by some overwrought imagination.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   That is the simple fact, as I think you all will agree.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And it has been the fact.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And the great question that confronts us is,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   "Why is that? What's the matter with mankind?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Why is it that men do not jump at such a message and cling to it at all costs,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   and spend their time in praising and in thanking God for it?"
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Well, that, it seems to me, is the question that is considered and argued and reasoned through
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   by this very prophet in this fortieth chapter of his prophecy,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   from verse twelve to the very end of the chapter.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   He takes up our difficulties and our objections and he answers them.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   What a wonderful book the Bible is.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   What a wonderful God is God, if I may speak with reverence.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   He not only gives us his gospel, he commends it to us.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   He goes further.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   He even meets us with our difficulties and solves them
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   and deals with them before our very eyes,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   not concerned merely to tell us what he's done.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   He stokes to our weakness, he comes right down to us,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and in his word to us he says, "Now this is your difficulty, isn't it?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   This is the thing at which you stumble."
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And he deals with it and analyzes it and unmasks it, answers it,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   and the whole case is stated plainly and clearly before us.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   That's precisely what you've got in this chapter.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Now, we've already looked at the first way in which the prophet does that.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   It's the argument from verse twelve to verse seventeen.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   He starts out once, of course, by saying
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   that the real source of all this difficulty is our appalling ignorance of God
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   and the true nature and character of God.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And very especially in that section, in that paragraph,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   he's concerned to show this great point of what I've described as the inscrutability of God's ways.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   That was really the central argument there.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or if you like,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   who can weigh the mind of God, or being his counsellor, hath taught him?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and showed to him the way of understanding?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And you remember how the apostle Paul takes that up
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   and works out his own mighty argument and logical case
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   about the whole presentation of the gospel in the second chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   He says the whole difficulty with you Greek philosophers is
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   that you're trying to understand something that by hypothesis is beyond your understanding.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Not that it is irrational, not that it itself is unreasonable,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   but because it's God's wisdom, your wisdom can't comprehend it.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   It's too small. The thing itself is so great and your minds are so finite.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   In other words, the ultimate cause of trouble, he argues, there is intellectual pride.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Man's fatal confidence in the ability of his own pygmy powers to span the mind of the eternal,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   how ridiculous it is.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And the prophet has dealt with that argument.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   But here he goes on to a further step.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And you notice how he introduces it.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   He's got a formula here which he uses in the 18th verse and again in the 25th verse.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   He stands back and says, "Well now, if that doesn't satisfy you,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   let me approach you like this," he seems to say.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   You say, "Still I don't understand about God and about such a marvelous gospel."
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Well then he says, "To whom then will ye liken God?"
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Or with what likeness will ye compare him?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   And then he repeats it as I say in verse 25.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Having again worked out an argument, he comes back again and says,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   "To whom then will ye liken me? Or shall I be equal, saith the Holy One?"
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   As if almost in desperation, he says, "Now how can I put this to you?"
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   What is your trouble? What is the thing that's holding you up?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   What's the thing that's preventing you from believing and accepting this gospel?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And here in this particular paragraph we're looking at tonight,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   he again deals with this great difficulty about doubting God's power
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   and God's ability to do what he has promised to do.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Now that is mankind's stumbling block.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   "Ah," they say, "that gospel sounds all right, but can these things be done?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Do these things really happen?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   It's all very well to tell us things like that, but can such things really take place?"
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Well, says this man, if you don't believe it, your trouble is that you still don't understand
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   the true nature and being of God. He's put it in general before.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   He's reminded us that God is the one who's measured the waters in the hollow of his hand
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   and meted out heaven with a span and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   He's told us about him already that the nations to God are but as a drop of the bucket
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   and are counted as the small dust of the balance.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   and that his glory is such that if you offered all the beasts in Lebanon
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   and burnt up their bodies with all the trees in Lebanon cut down,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   still it wouldn't be enough to satisfy this glorious God,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   because all nations before him are as nothing
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   and are counted to him less than nothing and vanity.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   But still, you see, he seems to realize that these people can't rise to it, they can't grasp it.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Well, why not? Well, evidently they're thinking about God in a wrong way.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So, he issues a challenge to them. He says, "What are your ideas of God?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   With whom are you comparing God?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Are you, I wonder, he says, thinking of God in terms of idols?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Is that your standard of measurement and of comparison?
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Or are you, perchance, thinking of God in terms of the great princes of the world
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   or perhaps the great judges, the wise men, the men who can hold the legal balance
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   and can sift and analyze evidence and having thought and pondered,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   can deliver a sound and a just verdict?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Is that the way you're thinking of God in terms of idols, princes, and great judges and great men?"
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And he takes up the challenge.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   He wants to help them, so he deals with this.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And this, as I understand it, is the way in which he puts his argument.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   He says, "It's perfectly clear to me that you believe in such.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   You believe in your idols.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   You believe in your princes. You believe in your judges and in your great men.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   And yet, though you can repose your faith and your trust and your belief in them,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   you say you can't believe in God and in the things that he has revealed.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   What a position! What an exposure of unbelief!"
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   That's his message, as I understand it.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   So, he proceeds to deal with that attitude, with that position, with that condition of mankind,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   this terrible state of unbelief, this staggering at the promises of God
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   and this readiness to believe and to accept the promises of men,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   the princes and the judges, and the trust that we put in our idols.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Now, there's his argument.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And from that argument, we are surely entitled to deduce
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   certain clearly defined teaching in the Bible
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   with regard to this unbelief from which mankind suffers in such a tragic manner.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Oh, in a sense, it's the great theme of the Bible.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Unbelief is our final curse.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   If only we all of us could believe in God tonight and in God's Son
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   and in God's way of salvation, oh, what a different place this world would be.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   If only men believed it and practiced it, if only men exercised faith and embraced it,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   the whole face of the earth would be so changed it would indeed become paradise.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   All our troubles come ultimately from unbelief.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   It's the final sin.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   It's the thing that has dug the footsteps of mankind.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   It's the cause of the original trouble, a doubt, a query, a question.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Hath God said, "There you are at once," a query.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   And then you begin to inflate yourself and to exaggerate yourself,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   and you begin to ask your questions.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   It's all a manifestation of unbelief.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   So I say it's the great theme of the Scriptures.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   But here, fortunately for us, the biblical case with regard to unbelief
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   is unfolded and unmasked before us in the form of these simple propositions.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   The first one is surely this, that unbelief is unutterably foolish.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   What folly it is not to believe in God.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Now, you can go through the Bible and you'll find that it's got many things to say about unbelief,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   many things to say about sin.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   It talks about it as rebellion, as arrogance.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   It talks about it as lawlessness.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   It talks about it as missing the mark.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   It's got many terms which it applies to it.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   And yet I think you'll agree with me when I say
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   that there is nothing that the Bible says quite so frequently about it as just this,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   it's unutterable folly.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   There are two Psalms which put it in a perfectly clear manner.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   They come as a kind of thunder clap to us when we read them.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   "The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'"
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And that's the final word to say about a man who says there is no God.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   He's a fool.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And when the Bible calls him a fool, what it means is that he's a foolish man,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   that he's dull, that he's stupid,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   that his real trouble is that he can't think straightly,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   that he's lacking in reason and in ability to understand.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   You remember how our Lord uses exactly the same term about a man
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   who lived entirely for this world and wasn't rich toward God,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   the man who'd got his barns bursting with the marvelous harvests that he'd had
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   and who'd become so wealthy that his very riches had become an embarrassment to him,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   and he congratulates his soul and says,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   "So, thou hast much goods laid up for many years.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry."
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And that night God said unto him, "Thou fool!"
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   You're a fool!
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   You think you're a hard-headed, wise businessman, a man of the world who is so wise,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   who hasn't become soft and got a religious complex and believes in God.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   He's the man of wisdom.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   But God's verdict is, "Thou fool!"
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Far from being a level-headed, far-sighted man,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   the real trouble with such a person is that he doesn't know how to think.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   He's a fool.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Well, here I say that is the aspect of the matter that the prophet brings out
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   in his own way with his own poetic imagery.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   But how plain and clear he puts it, this is how he puts it.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   He proves the folly of the unbeliever in this way,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   that the man who doesn't believe in God invariably believes in something.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   And what does he believe in?
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Well, he believes in idols.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   To whom then will he liken God, or what likeness will he compare unto him?
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Here's the answer.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   "The workman melteth a graven image,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   and casteth silver chains."
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   You see the trouble they make to make their idols?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Then he says, "He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   chooseth a tree that will not rot.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   He seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   that shall not be moved."
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   That's his description of men
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   as they're so busily engaged in making and in fashioning their idols.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   If they can afford it, they take a piece of gold,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   they take the most precious metal they can lay their hands on,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   they'll pay great money for it,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   and they get it fashioned into a particular form,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   and then these final touches are put,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   "The goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   and casteth the silver chains."
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   That's how they make their idols.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   All the best that they have, they put it into it because they believe in it,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   and because they think that this is going to help them.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   It's something to which they pin their faith,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   it's something by which they live.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Then there's this other curious statement about which the authorities are not agreed.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   "He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   chooseth a tree that will not rot."
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Here is a man who's so poor
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   that he can't make his idol of gold, nor of silver,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   nor of any precious metals.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   These precious metals, of course, are very expensive.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   And here's a man, he says, who can't afford a precious metal.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Well, what does he do?
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Well, he chooses the best type of wood he can get.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   He tries to find a piece of wood that's not likely to rot.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   The sort of wood that's well seasoned and hardened,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   it'll stand up to the elements and all the rigors of any climate.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   He chooses a tree that will not rot,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   and then he proceeds to fashion that,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and he puts that up and worships that as his idol.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   I say the authorities are a little bit disagreed at this point.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Some of them say that that is just a description of poor people,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   that the world can be divided into rich and poor.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   The rich people have their golden idols,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   the poor people can't afford that,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   so they make them of wood, the best wood they can possibly get.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Yes, but some others suggest this, and they may very well be right,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   that this is a reference not so much to those who were originally poor,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   but to those who have made so many idols
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   and have spent so much money on their idols
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   that they've made themselves poor in doing it,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   and that they've got nothing left now but to buy a piece of wood,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   the best they can get, and turn that into an idol.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Well, you see, it doesn't matter in a sense,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   except that that second exposition brings out this point,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   that it emphasizes the belief of people in these idols.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   If men actually will make themselves poor in paying homage to them,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   and in making them and in fashioning them to this extent,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   well, that is a measure of their faith and their belief in them.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   But whether we take this or the other explanation,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   you see, the poor man even healed by this piece of wood,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   the best he can get, in order that he may have his idol and his God,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   whom he can worship.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Now, these children of Israel who couldn't believe
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   the message of God through Isaiah about God,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   they'd been turning to idolatry.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   These people whom God had made for himself,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   he'd taken a man called Abram and had turned him into a nation,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   and he'd done his wonders in their presence.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   They turned their backs on it all, and they went to idol worshipping.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   In other words, they believed in idols.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   And they gave themselves to that kind of thing.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   They say they can't believe in God, but they can believe in idols.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Oh, my friends, I needn't keep you.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   The world is full of this kind of thing.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   People tell us that they're too intelligent and too able to believe in God.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   They can't do that sort of thing, they say.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   But look at the things which they do believe in.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Look at the modern idols.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   They say that this gospel is something that they are far too intelligent to believe in,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   to accept and submit to.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   But look at the things in which men do place their faith and their trust.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Look at the gods that the world makes for itself, sometimes just sheer wealth,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   sometimes money, sometimes position and status,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   sometimes dress, just mere clothing.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   The desire to be thought great, or people who are considered great,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   they turn them into idols.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Oh, there's no limit to the variety of idols that men and women make
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   and they're prepared to give themselves and impoverish themselves,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   as Isaiah here describes it.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   In doing these things, they'll give their time, their enthusiasm, their energy and their money.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   There are people who even become bankrupt because they're trying to keep up to a social level that's beyond them.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   They're so keen on the thing, it's so much to them.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   I say they even become bankrupt in order to try to do it.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   That's exactly a repetition of what these people did in ancient times
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   with their idols of gold and silver and things like that.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   There are people who are constantly in financial troubles and difficulties
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   and having to borrow money simply to try to keep up that kind of thing.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   That's idolatry.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   They're worshipping that kind of life.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   They think it's marvellous, they think it's wonderful,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   they think it's going to be productive of results.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And there are others who worship thought and who worship learning.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   There are people who undoubtedly worship science.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   They're always talking about it as if science was some kind of deity.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   They've turned something that is really abstract into something concrete.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   They say, "But science teaches and says."
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Of course, there's no such thing.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   What they mean is that certain scientists say this or that.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   But you see, science has become a god, and we fashioned it and made it into a god,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   and we are bowing before it and we are worshipping it.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   This tremendous thing that's there over us and over the whole life of mankind in the world tonight.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   I needn't keep you.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   The modern man says, "I believe in science.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   I believe in learning and in knowledge."
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   He's turned his back on God.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   He can't believe this sort of thing.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   But he believes that the advance of knowledge and learning,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   it's really something that's going to save man and the world.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   It's going to put everything right and straight.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Political action, all these things.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   These are the modern idols, the modern gods.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   You notice how he describes graphically the respect that people pay to their idols?
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   The faith they place in them, the trust they have in them,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   and they go to all this trouble and to all this expense,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   and there's nothing in a sense they won't do, because they believe in these things.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   It's exactly the same with the princes and with the judges of the earth.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   The modern man, increasingly it seems to me,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   believes in men and believes in great men.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   We surely all ought to be wide awake to this.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   It was the whole explanation, in a sense, of the tragedy of the last war.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   This idea of the supermen, the dictator.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   The great men, yes, it's all very well for us to look on
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   at what happened in Germany before the war.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   My dear friends, this country is rampant with the same thing, in a sense.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Always the same great men, but great men believe in men.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   It's perhaps one of the greatest dangers still confronting the modern world,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   this tendency of people in a sheep-like manner to listen to any leader
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   and to implicitly do what he tells them.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Work it out for yourselves.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   There are many evidences of this and many, many festations of it.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   The tendency to turn men into gods, to idealize them,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   to write them up, to work them up in our imaginations.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   We put things into them that are not in them, rarely.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   We do it with men and with women.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   I could give you many illustrations of the thing I have in my mind.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   It's done with princes.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   And with that whole view of life, we turn them into idols.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And it is done in the same way with this kind of person who is here summed up
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   and depicted in the character of the judge, the wise men, the farsighted leader.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And we are prepared to trust these men utterly and absolutely.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   We believe in their star, as we put it.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   We put a kind of aura around them and we tend to say that, of course,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   they are ultimately infallible and they can't go wrong.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   We say, you know, you don't always understand, but, oh, there's something there.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   There was a time when people believed in the divine right of kings
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   and they believed that there was a sort of divinity that would hedge a king.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   They no longer believe it in that form, perhaps,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   but they believe it concerning certain men.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   And we turn these into our gods.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Mankind, I say, believes in these princes, in these judges, and it respects them.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   We tend to do it with the philosopher, the philosophers, the wise men, the great men.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And the average person who doesn't believe in God and in the Christian faith,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   he's got unbounded faith in the wisdom of these great thinkers,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   these great philosophers who are going to solve all the problems of life for us
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   and are going to lead us into some kind of paradise.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   The princes, the princes in every sense, and the judges,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   these wise, learned, profound men.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   And as the world shows its respect to its idols,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   it shows the same respect to these princes and judges.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   It puts its faith in them.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   It will do anything for them.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   It will submit itself to them and allow them to rule and to govern
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   and to have almost a totalitarian control of their lives.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   They're lost in these things.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Isn't that the position?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Well, listen to the prophet's argument.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   He says, "You are believers in idols and in princes and in judges,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   and yet you don't believe in God."
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Oh, how terrible.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Listen to him and his divine sarcasm.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Having described all this production of images, he says,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   "Have ye not known? Have ye not heard?
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Hath it not been told you from the beginning?
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Have ye not understood from the foundation of the earth?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth," and so on.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   That's God. Contrast him with these.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   What he means, you see, is this.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Your idol, after you've spent all your money on him,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   on the gold and the silver and all the rest of it,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   has no existence at all.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   He has no being.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   The Bible is constantly exposing this.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Listen to the 115th Psalm doing it, for instance.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   He says, "Our God is in the heavens.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   He hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands."
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Listen to the description of them.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   "They have mouths, but they speak not;
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   eyes have they, but they see not;
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   they have ears, but they hear not;
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   noses have they, but they smell not;
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   they have hands, but they handle not;
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   feet have they, but they walk not;
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   neither speak they through their throat.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   And they that make them are like unto them,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   and so is every one that trusteth them."
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   If I tried to add to that, I'd be a fool.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   It's all there, my friends.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Oh yes, you employ the best engraver you can lay your hands on,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   because you want this to be a perfect image, a perfect idol.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   You're careful about the eyes and the carving of the nose
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   and the formation of the ears and the lips
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   and the hands and the feet, and there it is, it's finished.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   How marvellous that is worship.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   But before you proceed to worship,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   ask a simple, obvious question.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   What can he do for you?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Perfect eyes, yes, but he can't see.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   What a wonderful mouth, yes, but he can't speak.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Look at those hands, all the anatomy, the formation,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   everything's absolutely perfect, but he can't use them.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Look at the feet, yes, but he can't walk.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   After you've done it all, and you say, "How marvellous, aren't I wonderful,"
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   it can do absolutely nothing, it's useless.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   I needn't have taken you to the Psalms.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Isaiah himself does the selfsame thing
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   in the 46th chapter of this prophecy
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   in an equally perfect manner.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   He tells us there that the difference between God and an idol
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   can be put in this simple manner.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   An idol is a God that you have to carry.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   God is a God that'll carry you.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   You see, when you've made your idol, he can't move, he can't do anything,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   and you've got to do everything for him.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Men put their faith and their trust in idols,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   mere figures that are useless and can do nothing,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   and yet they don't believe in God, my friends.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   There's only one word for it, it's folly.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   People who make idols and who put their trust in idols
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   are like the very idols that they've made.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And it's exactly the same with the great men,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   with the princes and with the judges of the earth.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   What of them will listen to what he says?
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   "Yea, they shall not be planted, yea, they shall not be sown,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   He, God, shall also blow upon them,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   He bringeth the princes to nothing,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity."
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Isn't this clear and obvious to us, my beloved friends?
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Take all the idols that the world is worshipping tonight,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   what can they do?
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   What was the value of the idols during the last war?
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   How did they help you when your loved ones and dear ones were far away from home fighting?
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   What was the value of these things when you had the information
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   that some beloved son had suddenly been killed or a daughter killed in an air raid?
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   What's the value of all these things to you when you lose your health,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   when you lie upon your deathbed?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   No, there's nothing there, they can't do anything.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   And likewise with these great men, these princes, and with these judges of the earth.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   My dear friends, they've been tried and they've failed us.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   We are living in the twentieth century.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   The century that has followed the last century with all its learning
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   and all its advance and all its knowledge.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Are we still trusting to governments and to men, to princes and to powers?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Do we still believe in human wisdom and philosophy and political action?
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   What have these things done? Have they helped us?
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Haven't they all been proved to be vanity before our very eyes?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Haven't they all failed us in the hour of need?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   The world is proving it before our eyes and yet we trust these things.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Though they're obvious vanity, we believe in them and we trust them.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   And we make a kind of religion of them.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   We believe in vanity and we do not believe in God.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Don't you think that the prophet's argument is fully justified,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   that unbelief is unutterable folly?
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Don't you see that he is perfectly fair in what he argues and in what he reasons?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   We believe in them and we don't believe in God.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   My dear friends, there's only one word to describe that kind of thing.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   It is sure folly.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   But let me say a word on the second matter which he argues out.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   The second point he makes is that unbelief is always tragic ignorance.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And where do I find him saying this?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Well, let me show you. He says it in two ways.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   He says it first of all in the 21st verse.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   "Have ye not known? Have ye not heard?
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Hath it not been told you from the beginning?
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Have ye not understood from the foundation of the earth
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   that it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in?"
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   What's he mean?
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Well, what he means is this.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   It's another great argument in the Bible everywhere.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   That for men not to believe in God is just to display
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   a profound and tragic ignorance of the fact that God is, after all, the creator.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   "Haven't you heard this?" he says.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   "Didn't you know this?
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Hasn't this been something that has been known from the very dawn of civilization?
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   We believe by faith that God made the worlds out of nothing."
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Now, that is, as you remember, the great argument of the apostle Paul
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   in that section of the first chapter of the epistle to the Romans
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   that we have read together at the beginning.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Paul argues there that mankind, in sin and in unbelief,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   is inexcusable and is utterly without an argument. Why?
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Well, he says, there without excuse for this reason,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   that the invisible things of God have been clearly revealed from the very beginning.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   In creation, in nature, there is a proof and a manifestation of God.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   He says, if mankind hadn't had this revelation of God in nature,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   there would be some excuse for its unbelief and for its sin.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   But in view of nature, there is no excuse.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   God has revealed himself as the creator.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Now, this is a famous argument.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   It's the argument, if you like, from design and from order and from arrangement.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   It's the perfection of a flower. It's the perfection of a little lamb.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   It's all that you see in the seasons, coming regularly year by year,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   and all the provision that God has made.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   It's the instinct in the bird that accounts for migration.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   It's all these things. Can you really explain it apart from God?
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   The argument of the scripture is that that evidence is more than enough.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   It's the kind of argument that has been put in a much more feeble manner
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   by Sir James Jeans and by others,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   that they are driven by this very design and purpose to believe in an ultimate mind.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   But here it is.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   So that when a man doesn't believe in God, he's not thinking clearly about nature.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   He's not reasoning about creation.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   He's assuming things. He's taking things for granted.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   He's relying upon some hypothesis such as evolution,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   with its terrible gaps and with its piltdown men and all such things.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   He'll put his faith in that. A scientist gets up and says,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   "The piltdown man has established this." And we believe it and we say, "Marvelous."
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   And there's never been a piltdown man.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Now that isn't being cheap, my friends. I don't want to be cheap or unfair.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   I'm simply stating facts.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   We are more ready to believe in the theories and suppositions of scientists
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   than we are to believe the evidence of creation and this ultimate mind of God that's behind it all.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   It's just a sure fact.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And it's our ignorance that makes us do it.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   If only we understood the heavens and the earth and all the handiwork of God,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   we'd believe in him.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   But sin has blinded us.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   We're ignorant. The God of this world has blinded our minds.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And then let me say a passing word on the second argument which he brings,
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   which is in the 23rd verse.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   He tells us that God bringeth princes to nothing and maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   God has not only revealed himself in nature and creation,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   he has revealed himself also in history.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Now, I read to you the 46th Psalm at the beginning
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   in order that I might give you one of the brief, succinct statements of that particular argument.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   The argument of the psalmist is this. He says, "Consider these things.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Look how wars have been caused to cease,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   how the spear and the bow has been broken in sunder,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   and the chariots destroyed.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Who's done it all? The answer is God."
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   And therefore he says, "Be still. Give up, give in, and admit that he is God."
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Now, the argument of the scripture right through is just this,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   that the whole of history is a proof of the being of God.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   You can look at it, if you like, from the standpoint of secular history alone
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   and the rise of great dynasties and the fall of great dynasties.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Watch them coming up, watch them thriving, watch them receding.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Up they come, down they go. Why is that?
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Why do civilizations go down? What's the matter?
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Well, you may believe your modern historian who says that there is some implicit power
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   in the very historical process that does that.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   You see, he's idealizing and deifying historical process.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   He's turning that into a God.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   But can you believe that?
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Is that adequate? I find it totally inadequate.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   I only know of one adequate explanation. It's that of this book.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   It is the Lord God Almighty that's sitting on the circle of the universe,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   that's controlling history. It belongs to him.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   He started it, he made men, he set it all going, and he's controlling it.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   He's allowed sin to come in, but that doesn't mean he's abdicated.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   And when men build up their tower of Babel and say that their own intelligence is enough,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   he smashes it and he scatters them.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   Another great civilization arises and God blows upon it and it's gone.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   What a summary of history, and what accurate history, incidentally.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   And see them coming up in the Bible, these great dynasties rising one after another,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   Assyria, Babylon, the Chaldeans.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   He allows them to arise and down they go.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   He smashes them with the breath of his mouth.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Read your Old Testament history, my friends, and as you do so, see the hand of God in history.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   God will not allow any great nation to astride the earth as a colossus.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   You needn't be afraid.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   He's never allowed anybody to do it, he never will allow anybody to do it.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   They may appear as if they're going to do it.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   The world dictators come up one after another, and just with them, everything, God smites them, and down they go.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Read the book of Daniel, read the book of Revelation, read the history, I say, there it is.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Read the secular history since the birth of Christ, and you'll see it.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   You see, God is there, the Lord reigneth.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Let the people of God rejoice, but let the earth tremble.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   The God of history, he's revealed himself in history.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   He's doing these things, and you and I are so blind that we can't see it.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   We can't see it in this present century.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   We can't see it in the past century, and yet, there it is before our very eyes.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   But as you look back at it through the eyes of this prophet in this paragraph, aren't you ready to sing with me?
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   "Frail as summer's flowers we flourish, blows the wind and it is gone.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   But while mortals rise and perish, God endures unchanging on."
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Can't you see him? Don't you know him? Hast thou not known? Hast thou not heard?
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   He's sitting upon the circle of the universe, and all its people are but as grasshoppers in his sight and under his eyes.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   The Lord God of history, the creator, the controller of everything that is and ever will be.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   But man in his ignorance doesn't see it. He doesn't believe it.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   He'll believe in his star. He'll believe in luck.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   He'll believe in the greatness of his own nation. He'll believe in a particular leader.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   He'll believe in learning. He'll believe in all these things and believe that they do control destiny.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   "And the God in whose hand our breath is and all our ways, he does not glorify."
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   Oh, the ignorance of sin, the ignorance of these facts that God has proclaimed and put before us.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   We are without excuse, as the apostle Paul argues. The evidence is against us.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Face it, my friend, in nature, in history.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Follow the mighty argument of this inspired prophet.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   And that brings me to my last remark. Unbelief is folly. Unbelief is ignorance.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Unbelief is unaware of the consequences of its own attitude.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   I hesitate to say these things. I know they're disliked. I know they're unpopular.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   But, my dear friends, if I didn't say these things, I'd be false to my calling.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   I'd be a cad. I'd be a worst friend.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   Unbelief, I say, is unaware of the consequences of its own attitude.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   What do I mean? I mean this, that whether you and I believe these things or not, they're facts.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   God is God, and God is the Lord.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   The fact that I don't understand him doesn't mean that he isn't there.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   We don't understand electricity, but there it is.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   And though you and I may say that we don't believe in God because we don't understand him,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   God remains entirely unaffected.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   The God who has revealed himself in creation and in history
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   is the Lord God Almighty, the God of the universe.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   He is the Lord. He has the power.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   He's shown it in history when he's blown upon dynasties and they've gone,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   and when he's brought down tyrants and elevated nothings.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   And he is the judge of the universe.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   He sits upon the throne, and he'll share it with no one.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   He is alone and absolute in all his attributes and powers.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   And you and I, my friends, are all of us in his hands, every one of us.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   And we can't escape him, we can't avoid him.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   That's what this man is teaching. He's desperate, you see.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   Why is he pleading with these people? Well, he sees them.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   They're not believing in this God, this Almighty God.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   The business of preaching is to tell men and women, to tell us all,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   But our times are in his hands.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   Science can't help you, wisdom can't help you, it can't banish death,
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   it can't abolish the end.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   My dear friends, when will we wake up and be wise and realize these things?
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   What's the value of talking about our princes, our judges, our great men,
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   our great nations, and our great ideas, when we know they don't help us at this point?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   We are here and God is there and we've got to stand before him.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   And it's madness not to realize it. It's tragic folly, I say.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   If there were no other reason for believing in him, that would be enough.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Wisdom dictates that we should believe in God, because he is God.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   And because as God he has a right to everything.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   He's made us for himself and he's entitled to us.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   And we have no right to ourselves, for we haven't given ourselves being,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   we haven't given ourselves life, we haven't given ourselves health, strength, or anything else.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   We owe all to God. He's the giver of every good and every perfect gift.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   Wisdom alone dictates we should believe in him,
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   because not to believe in him is to pit yourself against the Almighty
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   and to invite being crushed to all eternity.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   But thank God I have something to commend belief in God to you,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   which takes us beyond wisdom, though that is enough.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   And that is that this Almighty God, the Lord of the universe,
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   though you and I, fools as we are, and pygmy creatures of time as we are,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   have rebelled against him and have sinned against him and have blasphemed his name
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   and have tried to spit in his face, though we've done it and deserve ultimate retribution and hell,
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   he has looked upon us with a piteous eye.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   He's loved us in spite of it.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   His grace and mercy and compassion are such
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   that into a world of such people he sent his only Son
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   and not only sent him in the likeness of sinful flesh,
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   but sent him to the cross and laid upon him our sins
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   and beat him with our stripes, the stripes that we deserved,
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   and there he's revealed his love to you and his compassion,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   as if to say, "If you don't believe in me, of the evidence of creation
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   and the evidence of history and the marks of my handiwork,
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   believe me there as I open my heart to you
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   and ask you to come back to me,
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   that I may love you and possess you and bless you
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   all the days of your life on earth
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   and then receive you to myself and share my eternal glory with you."
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   Can you still resist him?
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   You believe in idols.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   You believe in princes. You believe in judges.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   Can you refuse to believe in such a God?
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   Beloved friend, there's the argument.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   See its inevitability.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   Put your signature to it. Set your seal to it that it's true.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   Turn to him immediately, without a moment's delay or hesitation,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   and say to him, "I see it. I believe it.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   I can't understand it. I can't understand such love
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   that thou shouldst ever have looked upon me in spite of my sin and arrogance,
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   but I believe the message.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   Thou art so great, so good. Such love.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   I believe it. I accept it.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   I give myself to thee in Jesus Christ.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   Be wise. Be reconciled to God.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   Amen.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
