[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.760]   - Happy Memorial Day to everyone listening.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.480]   The Ask Pastor John podcast continues to roll along
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.720]   and for the next few days,
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.500]   we're gonna talk about adoption.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.840]   Pastor John, your 18 year old daughter, Talitha,
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.480]   recently graduated from high school,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.280]   a momentous occasion you've written about
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.680]   and blogged about recently at the Desiring God blog.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.560]   At this stage in her life and at this stage in your life,
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.600]   do you have any reflections about her story
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.900]   and about adoption in general?
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.120]   - Yeah, I wanna take this opportunity, Tony,
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.120]   to encourage again, those who are considering adoption
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.860]   and or even have already adopted
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.820]   and might be running into difficulties.
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.880]   Remember, I was 50 years old when we adopted Talitha.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.040]   She was eight weeks old.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.360]   She's born in Georgia.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.240]   We were living in Minneapolis.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.480]   She was our only daughter.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.480]   We raised four sons, only adopted child,
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.500]   only African-American child, and it was a closed adoption.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.140]   We don't have any idea who her mother or her father are.
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.600]   And we would be totally fine if Talitha wanted to know
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.900]   who they are, but I just mentioned those facts
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900]   to show that the challenges we were facing,
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.360]   they felt very significant to me.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.280]   And the reason I feel like I wanna encourage folks
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.140]   is not just 'cause we overcame some of those obstacles
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.500]   like being 50 years old, but because the more,
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.800]   the longer and the wider the culture of adoption
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.400]   becomes in our churches, the more stories multiply
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.160]   of great pain and great sorrow in these experiences.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.560]   And I don't wanna whitewash any of that.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.040]   People need to have their eyes open.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.200]   Parents who are pondering adoption need to know
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   the kinds of sorrows that they might encounter.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.960]   But of course, they will say, and they're right,
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.160]   all parenting is unpredictable.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.280]   A biologically born child to a mom or dad
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.220]   may have huge physical or psychological issues.
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.460]   They may die early.
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.400]   They may be disabled in an accident.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.160]   You may wind up caring for your child as long as you live.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.780]   And that's quite apart from adoption.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.480]   They may break your heart, turning away from your faith.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.720]   They may experience divorce or professional catastrophe
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.160]   and on and on and on.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.320]   And parenting never stops.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.680]   We thought, wow, we'll parent for 30 years
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.880]   and then we'll be done.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.360]   And it's not true.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.700]   So I just want to encourage those folks
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.120]   who are considering adoption that yes,
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.580]   you will encounter the possibilities
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.900]   of incredible and unbearable challenges.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.860]   Children who've lived in orphanages
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.280]   or been passed around among relatives,
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.520]   they bring issues, they bring stuff to the family
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.560]   that you don't have any idea about.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.180]   I've seen cases of compulsive stealing and lying
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.560]   and running away from home and expressed hatred
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.700]   for mom and dad and bizarre behaviors
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.600]   like banging your head against this concrete floor
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.280]   until it bleeds.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.520]   I mean, you're sometimes just, what have we gotten into?
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.800]   And everybody needs to know that whether it's a natural,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.580]   naturally born child or a naturally adopted child,
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.500]   that might be your lot.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.800]   And when you embrace a child one way or the other,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.760]   God expects you to fulfill your obligations.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.840]   And yet, sometimes it can't happen.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.360]   I've seen disruptions that break everybody's heart.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.620]   And I don't think the parents were wrong
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.140]   to do that kind of disruption.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.140]   But the main thing I want to say is there are happy stories.
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.760]   And I want to make sure people hear happy stories
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.940]   'cause there's so many of the other kind, I think.
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.060]   And Talitha, our daughter, is a happy story.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.800]   And I'm not so naive as to think, well, it's over.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.520]   You know, she's home free at 18.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.480]   That's not true.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.620]   I know that's not true.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.620]   But at this point, I am so thankful that we did what we did.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.760]   She's just graduated from high school,
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.180]   which is why I'm thinking about this.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.960]   And she's going to Boyce College in Louisville in the fall.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.860]   And she trusted Christ when she was eight years old
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.040]   and I think has given significant evidence
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.260]   of the work of the Spirit in her life.
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.140]   We've got our tensions at home,
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.480]   and I think probably some of them are unique
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.760]   to an adoptive situation.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.560]   But she has been so blessed,
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.480]   and her work ethic is just off the charts reliable.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.560]   She's done all of her schoolwork
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.480]   without any arm twisting whatsoever.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.600]   She wonders why college freshmen
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   can't get their assignments in on time
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.780]   when she's in the same class with them online right now.
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.720]   And she's loved to learn to cook,
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.080]   and she keeps her room neat,
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.600]   and she's avoided major destructive relationships.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.180]   And she's loved the church,
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.160]   and she's got wonderful deep friendships.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.840]   And she and we are not perfect,
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.200]   and we're all growing to greater maturity,
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.840]   and that's necessary.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.280]   But it's a good story.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.240]   And people need to know
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.800]   that we don't look back with any regrets.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.800]   I'm 68 years old and have a graduating daughter
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.640]   from high school,
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.120]   and I wondered when we adopted her,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.920]   what would it be like for an African American daughter
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.320]   to have an old man for a dad?
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.600]   And God has been good.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.440]   She's never said anyway,
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.180]   I don't like having a grandfather for a father.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.120]   So it's been good.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.120]   We are very thankful.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.640]   We're so encouraged.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.680]   And we just want to say
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.600]   that God is able to make all grace abound to you
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.160]   so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.000]   you will abound in every good work.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.880]   He'll be enough for you, whatever you have to face.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.680]   - What a precious testimony.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.160]   Thank you for sharing that with us, Pastor John.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.720]   And tomorrow we'll talk to couples
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.200]   who are considering adoption,
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.520]   and then Lord willing on Wednesday,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.360]   we'll wrap up this little three-part series on adoption
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.400]   to talk about one big issue of raising an adopted child.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.120]   And that is explaining adoption to your child.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.800]   When and how do you do that?
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.480]   Well, perhaps you're like many couples
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.360]   and you're listening to this and thinking to yourself,
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.000]   with so many orphans in the world,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.200]   why would any Christian couple
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.740]   even consider having biological children of their own?
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.200]   If that's a question you've thought about,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   and it's a very important one,
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.520]   be sure to check out Ask Pastor John,
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.040]   episode number 202 in the archive.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.560]   We've talked about that in the past
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.960]   and we'll be back tomorrow,
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.480]   and Pastor John will offer some counsel
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.560]   to couples pondering adoption.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.040]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
