[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   Well, have we forgiven someone if the wrong they committed against us keeps replaying
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.800]   in our minds?
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.680]   It's a question from a listener named Emily.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.880]   It's a very good question.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.160]   But before we get to that question, today is the final day of T4G in Louisville, and
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.000]   we're talking today over the telephone, not over the studio line.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.400]   And so here's that email from Emily.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.640]   Dear Pastor John, thank you for your years of faithful ministry online.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.000]   My question is in regards to forgiveness.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.280]   The other day, my husband made a hurtful comment about my appearance and with the help of wise
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.800]   counsel and older woman in the faith, walked me through expressing my hurt to my husband
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.320]   about it.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.960]   Of course, he asked for my forgiveness right away.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.640]   But the lingering question I have is this, how do I know if I've truly forgiven him?
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.040]   It still hurts when I think about it.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.920]   And I do think about the event.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.200]   I'm seeking by God's help to serve and love him despite what I feel.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.360]   But is lingering pain from the offense a sign that I have not really forgiven my husband?
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.600]   Let me start broad in a way that I think will be more generally helpful to all of us who
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.640]   are married and even others in similar kinds of relationships, perhaps, and then get more
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.840]   specific for Emily's issue of whether she has really forgiven her husband.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.640]   What I have found in our marriage, which I did not expect, and which I think is true
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:50.080]   more generally in marriage, is that for Christians, that is for me, who want to bring their lives
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.120]   into complete conformity to the teaching of Scripture, the great battle for holiness,
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.480]   that is the battle for being the most loving person that you can be, as God portrays and
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:13.040]   defines holiness in the Bible, that battle consists more than I ever thought it would
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.040]   in the struggle to avoid sinning in response to being sinned against.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.320]   Let me say that again because it might sound a little complicated.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.080]   One of the greatest battles for holiness and love in Christian marriage is the battle to
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:41.580]   avoid my sin in response to my wife's sin, which I may feel against me.
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.360]   But I have in mind the kind of thing that Emily's talking about, namely just being sinned
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:53.540]   against by words that hurt or by neglecting words that would have helped or by facial
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:02.840]   expressions that seem to indict or patterns of behavior that seem indifferent or disappointments
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.880]   that seem they could have been avoided with just a little more care, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:17.900]   And of course, complicating this is that we often feel sinned against when the words or
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.740]   the behavior had no sinful intention behind them at all.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:31.320]   And if we tried to forgive such a behavior, it would be offensive because the other person
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:39.920]   doesn't even feel that she or he did sin against us, and so our offering forgiveness is like
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.060]   an indictment that they don't feel guilty of.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:53.920]   So with that complication, one of John Piper's major battles, and sounds like others share
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:04.100]   it, battles for holiness in marriage and other relationships is not simply avoiding sinning
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.660]   against others.
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.260]   That's the simple way I thought about it as I began marriage.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.380]   I think I'm just going to avoid sinning against my wife.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:20.540]   But rather, the more complicated situation of avoiding sinful responses to the sins of
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.920]   others.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:30.740]   And what makes this battle so peculiar is that in the very moment when we may be sinning
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.600]   against someone, we have strong feelings of self-justification because of how we've been
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.240]   sinned against.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.420]   So it's subtle.
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.260]   We can hardly bring ourselves to think of ourselves as right now having to deal with
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.120]   my sin when really the issue is her sin.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.680]   What Paul Tripp calls your inner lawyer is rising up and saying, "Hey, it's her problem.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.680]   It's her problem.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.000]   You don't have any sin problem here.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It's her problem."
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.800]   When in fact, my biggest issue right now is my sin.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.160]   And some of the feelings that we have may be warranted, may be justified.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.340]   Some of the hurt or the indignation may be justified.
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:26.880]   So you can see how complicated the emotional moment is when there is an actual warranted
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.760]   sense of being wronged.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:39.200]   We say that again, an actual warranted sense of being wronged along with the hearts rising
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.920]   up sinfully in response to the wrong.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:52.040]   So all of that to say that Emily's question is a very important part of a larger and common
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:06:00.800]   issue in most long-term relationships, especially marriage, where we inevitably say and do things
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:09.400]   that hurt or disappoint or frustrate the other person and where we must navigate the complexities
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:20.680]   of both being genuinely wronged and yet dealing with our own sinful responses to being wronged.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.800]   One of the most important things that I see in all relationships, especially marriage,
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:36.320]   is that my responsibility before God is not, not the behaviors of my wife, but my responses
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.720]   to those behaviors.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.200]   It's my responsibility.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:45.160]   It is very easy, especially in the beginning of a relationship, to feel like, "I gotta
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.400]   fix all the things that are coming against me that I don't like, you know, that frustrate
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.440]   me or disappoint me or wrong me.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.840]   I gotta fix that other person and help them stop doing the things that bother me or frustrate
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.320]   me or wrong me."
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:08.680]   Instead of realizing my number one responsibility before God and my number one challenge in
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:19.120]   holiness is not getting my partner changed, but getting myself changed so that I respond
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:27.040]   in godly, Christ-like, humble, loving ways, even if what is being said is hurtful.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.560]   It seems to me that the overwhelming challenge of the New Testament to all of us is, "Do
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.880]   not return evil for evil," 1 Peter 3:9.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.600]   "Do good to those who hate you," Luke 6:27.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.440]   Paul, "When reviled, we bless.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.640]   When persecuted, we endure.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:51.240]   When slandered, we entreat," 1 Corinthians 4:12.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:08:00.320]   The deep, sweet, strong contentment we have to have, we must have in Christ in order to
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:07.000]   have emotional resources to respond like that, that's the great beauty of the Christian life.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.320]   That kind of sweet, deep, strong contentment in Christ.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.960]   That magnifies Christ wonderfully.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:22.760]   To have resources to respond encouragingly and hopefully and wisely to one who wrongs
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:32.120]   us instead of angrily or with self-pity or whining or manipulative moping or silent treatment
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.120]   or sullenness.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.800]   You can hear my acquaintance with my sin.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:47.280]   This is the great miracle that the children of God, John Piper anyway, wants to experience.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:53.900]   We all hurt each other and disappoint each other and frustrate each other almost every
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.920]   day in some degree.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:03.120]   The great challenge in the Christian life is to be so deeply and joyfully content in
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.600]   our fellowship with Jesus and all that God promises to be for us in Him that we are not
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:15.360]   drained, we're not drained by the disappointments of our relationships.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:22.600]   So with regard to Emily's specific question, I would say this, consider the analogy between
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.240]   being emotionally hurt and physically hurt.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:32.960]   When Paul was whipped with 39 lashes, even after he forgave his persecutor, there would
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:39.400]   have been big welts on his back and terrible lacerations on his back that would have hurt
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.960]   him for weeks to come.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:51.100]   So on this analogy, there can be both physical and emotional pain that lingers after the
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.400]   act of forgiveness.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.720]   This pain in and of itself is not necessarily sinful.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.240]   It's not necessarily a sign of unforgiveness.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:12.640]   However, we all know that both physical pain and especially emotional pain can morph, morph
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.460]   in an instant into resentment and anger and bitterness.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:22.040]   And that morphing can be so subtle that it's hard to know when it's happened.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.100]   And that's why Emily is asking her question.
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:35.220]   It's hard to know when her pain is morphing into selfishness and bitterness and resentment.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:42.600]   So I would just conclude with four brief suggestions for Emily and for the rest of us to keep our
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.460]   pain and our sorrow from morphing into sinful, unforgiving resentment.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:55.340]   Number one, let's do what Jesus did in 1 Peter 2, 23, where instead of returning evil for
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.780]   evil, he handed over to him who judges justly.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:06.220]   We consciously take any sense of being wronged and we hand it over to God who is able to
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.420]   settle accounts more justly and wisely than we can.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:17.600]   Number two, direct your mind away from the hurt, away from whatever act you're remembering
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.060]   to what is true and beautiful and pure and lovely and praiseworthy, like Paul says, with
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.980]   a sense of being treated by God better than we deserve.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:33.900]   And number three, renounce all tendencies to punish or wound your spouse with acts or
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.060]   words or looks or silence.
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:44.740]   And lastly, earnestly will and work for the good of the one you have forgiven.
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:50.360]   The real sign of forgiveness is that you don't seek to punish the other.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.940]   You seek the good of the other.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.940]   So good.
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:12:00.200]   Those are vital hedges that we need in our lives against this toxic resentment that grows
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.700]   up when we relive the wrongs of others against us, especially in marriage.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.700]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:40.180]   Well, when it comes to all those New Testament warnings aimed at the rich, are those warnings
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.900]   directed at middle-class Americans today?
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.620]   Are we the wealthy ones?
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.180]   We're going to break for the weekend and tackle that one on Monday.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.620]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
