[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.000]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.200]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.460]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.900]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.460]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.700]   My name is Joshua, I am your host,
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.380]   and today I'm gonna give you part two
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.300]   of my previous language learning podcast,
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.880]   although frankly I wish I had released this show first
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.940]   before the previous show.
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.740]   In part one, I talked about some practical tools
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.580]   to help you with learning your next foreign language,
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.220]   but today I wanna give you some strategy
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.900]   around the use of languages,
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.860]   especially as it relates to your financial opportunities,
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.000]   and I want to share with you a rubric
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.600]   for deciding strategically which languages to learn.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.640]   A few of the ideas here at the beginning
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.940]   will be a repetition of some of the ideas
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.320]   discussed in part one,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.180]   but I think it's still worth your time,
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.440]   so I encourage you to give it a shot.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.680]   I wanna bring the topic of language learning
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.280]   all the way back to the very beginning.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.980]   The mission that I open each show with
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.920]   is helping you to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.400]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.500]   in 10 years or less.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.420]   That's what I state at the beginning
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.060]   and opening of every single show,
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.840]   and yet I talk for hours and hours
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.340]   about topics that, in my mind,
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.700]   directly relate to that mission,
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.980]   but they span across basically the whole world,
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.040]   all the topics, and I tie them back to those missions,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.180]   and that's what I'm gonna do
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.280]   with the topic of language learning,
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.620]   because I believe that language learning
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.860]   is an extremely valuable skill
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.820]   that will help you to achieve
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.520]   that dual-fold mission more effectively,
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.540]   that mission of living a rich life now
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.040]   and building a plan for financial freedom,
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.360]   and I wanna explain to you the path of how you get there
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.700]   so you can see how this applies in so many other areas
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.940]   of life.
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.580]   Now, first, back to the radical personal finance framework
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.580]   for wealth.
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.180]   All else being equal, we know that one of the best things
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.780]   that you can do to improve your opportunities
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.920]   for financial freedom and to live a richer life now
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.880]   is to increase your income.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.480]   All else being equal, the higher your income,
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.400]   the better your life is going to be,
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.960]   and the faster you'll achieve financial freedom.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.500]   This is true whether you're pursuing
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.240]   a more traditional model of financial independence.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.940]   Perhaps you're planning to work
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.000]   over the course of a 40- or 50-year career.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.980]   Well, if you can earn a higher income,
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.640]   you will, of course, generate more money,
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.480]   and you'll be financially free to a higher degree.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.220]   It's also true in the shorter-term plans.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.060]   If you're pursuing an aggressive path to financial freedom,
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.160]   the higher your income, the easier it is.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.960]   It's much easier to become wealthy
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.000]   with a $500,000-a-year income
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.860]   than a $50,000-a-year income.
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.560]   That should be obvious.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.320]   However, I believe that the higher income
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.400]   can also lead to a richer lifestyle.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.120]   One of the things that I think is underappreciated
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.960]   from those who haven't earned a lot of money
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.160]   is that if you'll just simply increase
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.560]   your earnings substantially,
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.360]   you can do two things simultaneously
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.160]   that often seem at odds with each other.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   You can live a higher lifestyle,
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.580]   and you can also become wealthier.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.360]   Again, perhaps you're earning $50,000 per year.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.920]   Well, you may be able to save some money
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.480]   on a $50,000-per-year income,
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.420]   but you'll have to be extremely frugal.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.920]   But if you increase your earnings
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.360]   from $50,000 to $350,000 per year,
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.720]   you can dramatically improve your lifestyle,
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.400]   and you can dramatically increase
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.320]   the amount of savings that you have.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.000]   So if we walked away from most of the other parts
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.240]   of technical analysis,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.720]   and we just focused relentlessly on increasing our income,
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.840]   there's a very good chance that that would help you
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.760]   to live a richer and better life now,
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.820]   while also reaching financial freedom faster.
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.720]   You say, "Joshua, what about so-and-so celebrity
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.160]   "that earned $58 million and now they're broke?"
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.800]   Yeah, that exists.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   There are people who are in that situation.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.400]   So it is important that we talk about expenses
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.460]   and investing wisely, et cetera.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.600]   But the number one driver is your income.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.200]   And so it should consume perhaps 80% of our attention,
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.520]   and everything else should be relocated
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.000]   to perhaps 20% of our time and of our attention.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.960]   Well, how do you increase your income?
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.320]   How do you build a strong income?
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.040]   My answer to that is you need to develop
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.780]   economically valuable skills.
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.520]   Separately, I teach about those
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.080]   economically valuable skills.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.520]   In my career and income planning course,
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.340]   I go through the five major ones
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.320]   and talk about how important they are.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.640]   And you can apply these in the context of employment,
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.900]   working for another person, another company.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.380]   You can also apply these in the context
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.400]   of your own business or self-employment.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.380]   But you wanna develop these financially valuable skills.
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.160]   To put things at the most simple level,
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.040]   you want to develop yourself to be a highly valuable person.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.200]   And that's what's at the foundation
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.840]   of a lot of money and career advice that you have received.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.240]   For example, the traditional path,
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.520]   the first step to developing yourself
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.400]   as a financially valuable person
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   has often been the attainment of educational certifications,
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.700]   finishing your high school degree,
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.400]   getting a college degree.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.640]   And those things are helpful, they're valuable.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.860]   It can be part of a credentialization process.
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.960]   It may even come with knowledge that helps you.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.320]   And so that can be extremely valuable.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.760]   And especially in difficult economic times,
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.200]   those additional qualifications stand out
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   as being much more important.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.000]   For example, I believe that you can make
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.040]   a very strong argument that the economic value
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.080]   of a college degree is overrated.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.240]   It's overestimated in the marketplace.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.800]   However, it is certainly true that as a class,
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.680]   people with college degrees experience
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.080]   significantly lower level of unemployment
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.200]   than people without college degrees.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.000]   And so when there are times of high unemployment,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.520]   you look around and you're grateful
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.000]   that you can put on a resume,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.720]   "Yes, I have a college degree."
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.040]   And the more degrees you have,
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.280]   depending on the field, the better.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.580]   And so that's one way of enhancing your attractiveness.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.500]   But what do you do in a crowded marketplace?
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.480]   What do you do if you're applying for a job
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.280]   and there are a hundred candidates
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.680]   and those 100 candidates all have a bachelor's degree,
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.080]   they all tick that box and say,
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.680]   "Yes, I have a bachelor's degree."
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.960]   Well, you need to stand out
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.640]   because you have to remember that as a job applicant,
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.760]   as an employee, you are always competing
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.940]   against other employees.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.760]   One of the most fundamental economic concepts
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.040]   to master and drill and remember and to teach loudly
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.040]   is this, employees do not compete with employers.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.480]   Rather, employees compete with other employees
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.220]   and employers compete with other employers.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.320]   So there's no need for antagonism in a free society
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.500]   between employees and employers,
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.900]   but you are going to have to compete
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.480]   with other potential employees
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.360]   who are applying for the same job.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.520]   And so thus, you need to stand out.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.840]   Now, of course, there are many ways of standing out.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.480]   One way might be a certain academic degree or certification.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.800]   Another way might be certain professional certifications.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.320]   Other ways of standing out
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.480]   might be excellent interpersonal skills
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.640]   or excellent work history.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.500]   But at its core, what you need to do
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.440]   is to develop yourself and develop your skills
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.400]   into a uniquely attractive package.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.800]   And this is where languages can come in
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.120]   because if you are competing against one other job candidate
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.800]   and both of you have compelling work histories,
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.320]   both of you interview well,
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.140]   you have good interpersonal skills,
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.960]   you're able to build a sense of amiability
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.760]   and interpersonal connection during the interview process,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.040]   you have good writing skills or good technical skills,
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.440]   you have the appropriate academic credentials,
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.560]   you need something that's gonna set you apart.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.720]   And that's what you're looking for.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.800]   One of those some things that might set you apart
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   is language skills, the ability to speak or to write
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.360]   or to work in multiple languages.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.320]   In the previous show, I used the example.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.920]   I find a lot of job listings available
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.520]   for social media consultants who are bilingual.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.760]   And if you're gonna go out and you say,
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.400]   I wanna be a social media manager, excuse me, I meant manager,
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.060]   I say, I wanna be a social media manager,
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.680]   but you only speak English,
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.560]   well, there are jobs available for you
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.600]   and that might be an interesting job.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   But if you are bilingual in English and Cantonese,
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.720]   now there's a much more unique set of jobs
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.920]   available for you.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.400]   There's a much smaller candidate pool.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.940]   So instead of you're having to compete
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.600]   against thousands of other people,
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.960]   perhaps there's a few dozen people
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.200]   that you're competing against.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.560]   And the wages that you'll receive for your work
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.380]   are most likely going to be higher.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:06.000]   So at its core, languages can provide you
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.120]   with an opportunity to simply earn more money.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.720]   But the benefits of being multilingual don't stop there.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.080]   That is interesting and it is important,
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.160]   but the benefits don't stop there.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.440]   What about living a rich life?
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.700]   Well, I've always found the topics
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.080]   of intercultural communication
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.320]   and international living fairly interesting.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.940]   My undergraduate bachelor's degree
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.200]   is actually in international business.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.040]   And I've always found the context
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.720]   of international business interesting.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.520]   That's an interesting wrinkle
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.120]   over the standard day-to-day enjoyment of business.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.960]   And I've known a lot of people who've been involved
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.360]   in international business.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.960]   And it can be one way for those who are interested
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.680]   in such a lifestyle, it can be one way
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.400]   for people to enjoy a more interesting and varied career.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.680]   Now, for some people, they would prefer not to have a career
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.160]   that involves them going to different countries,
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.580]   being on an airplane, moving to different places.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.160]   But I think there's probably more people
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.860]   that do like that than not, or at least my guess would be
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.400]   that more of my listeners would be attracted
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.600]   to those things than are not.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.440]   Why do I say this?
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.260]   Well, in my experience as a financial planner,
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.580]   when I would talk with people about things like retirement,
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.480]   one of the most common dreams that people have
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.500]   in retirement is to travel more.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.880]   I like to travel, but I've always enjoyed
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.400]   kind of slower travel.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.920]   The ability to travel at a different pace
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.080]   than just a whirlwind one week tour of Europe.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.620]   And so that's one of the reasons
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.800]   why international business has always attracted me
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.040]   as a person.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.960]   If I were to take a job and let's say that I took a job
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.960]   and I went and worked for a large multinational corporation,
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:54.240]   maybe I go and work for Siemens or some global automaker.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.020]   Well, if I go and spend five years living
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.500]   and working in Germany, it's now easier for me
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:05.460]   to access the European continent for my leisure travel
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.880]   than if I have to fly over from New York City all the time.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.240]   Similarly, I can relocate from Germany to Singapore
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.560]   or to South Korea.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.240]   And now I can access all of Asia very, very simply.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.920]   And perhaps then after that, I go and spend five
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.280]   or seven years living in the UAE.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.320]   Well, now I have low cost air flights
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.040]   to an incredible portion of the world.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.140]   And so financially speaking,
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.420]   if you're interested in something like travel,
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.520]   having the ability to work in multiple cultural contexts
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.420]   and to speak multiple languages is obviously valuable.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.820]   It can change things for you.
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.220]   Even in the retirement phase,
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.100]   I have openly advocated that internationalization
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.340]   should be considered as a strategy for retirement,
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.780]   as a strategy for many things.
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.060]   Some people recognize that, hey, I can live very well
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:05.060]   on a lower cost of, on $1,500 a month if I live in Mexico,
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.420]   and I can live better on $1,500 a month in Mexico
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.340]   than I can in the United States.
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.740]   Or I can live very well in Thailand or the Philippines
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.240]   or Uruguay or some other place that you're interested in.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.060]   And you genuinely can.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.900]   But your experience of that lifestyle
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.020]   will be dramatically different based upon your knowledge
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.420]   of the local language.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.140]   You can live in Mexico and not speak a word of Spanish.
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.780]   You can live in a gringo English-speaking community
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.700]   and do perfectly fine.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.340]   I know people that do.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.740]   But your experience will be dramatically improved
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.860]   if you are fluent in Spanish.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.180]   And so there are many lifestyle reasons
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.580]   in addition to the personal reasons
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.860]   I discussed in the previous show,
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.260]   things like making you smarter,
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.300]   increasing your mental abilities,
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.980]   pushing off the advent of chronic degenerative diseases
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.100]   like Alzheimer's or something like that.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.140]   And it just interesting,
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.220]   opens up a more interesting part of the world.
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.460]   You get to know people better
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.700]   when you can speak their language.
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.700]   And so there are many reasons,
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.880]   but there are very compelling financial reasons
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.260]   that you should consider.
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.280]   Give you just a couple other examples.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.380]   I've thought about this strategy
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.340]   even in the context of my children.
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.760]   I'm working, I wanna be cautious about what I say publicly
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.460]   because of course, as a parent,
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.500]   you're looking at your children
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.540]   and trying to discern where their interests are.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.540]   But my ambition for my children
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.020]   is that they be multilingual.
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.860]   What level of multilingualism do I expect of them?
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.360]   I don't know, I don't know.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.940]   In a dream world, they'd speak a half a dozen languages,
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.520]   but I'm not committed to doing the hard work.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.100]   I think that there comes a point
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.920]   where you can require a certain level of work from a student,
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.760]   but at some point,
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.180]   the student has to actually want something.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.480]   And even if I wanna speak a dozen languages,
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.580]   I may or may not transfer that onto my children.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.500]   And I think that they should be free
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.180]   to make their own choices.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.460]   But my ambition is that my children be
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.820]   at a minimum bilingual, if not multilingual to some degree.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.900]   And I'm working hard and investing into them,
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.980]   but with differing levels of results.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.980]   One of my children has taken naturally to language learning
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.820]   and is doing extremely well, others not so much.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.160]   So we'll see as the years go by.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.600]   But even in terms of my own financial strategy,
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.740]   multilingualism, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.900]   is a compelling part of it.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.740]   I've publicly talked about my distaste for college funds.
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.100]   The standard, you know, US American open a 529 plan.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.860]   Doesn't mean I'm opposed to paying for college,
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.620]   just means that generally as a financial planner,
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.820]   I think that something like 529 plans
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.100]   are relatively overrated.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.280]   But that doesn't mean that education is unimportant.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.740]   And so I've developed a series of strategies
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.980]   of what would I do if I really wanted my child
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.180]   to go to college, but I couldn't,
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.140]   but I didn't have the money for it.
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.300]   Maybe I just went totally broke and I couldn't pay for it.
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.820]   And I was the dumb, dumb father who didn't save any money
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.420]   in my kid's college plan and I still got to do it.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.780]   Well, of course, some of the strategies include
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.380]   them paying for it.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.100]   Some of the strategies include
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.140]   less expensive degree programs, accredited programs online,
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.980]   or community school, scholarships,
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.700]   all those things I publicly talked about.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.380]   But there are even just interesting options
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.540]   with internationalization.
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.380]   So for example, right now, as things,
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.700]   as I record this in June of 2020,
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.980]   if you have a child that wants to go to college,
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.580]   your child can go to college for free in Germany
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.800]   and possibly other European countries as well.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.340]   But certainly I know in Germany,
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.820]   Germany wants international students to come
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.580]   and to get a German degree.
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.700]   And so they'll offer zero tuition,
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.500]   access to German universities.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.580]   And then you may need to provide for some living expenses,
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.580]   but possibly even not theirs,
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.820]   but some level of living expenses is appropriate.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.220]   And sometimes those are defrayed by the university as well.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.300]   What are the requirements though?
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.780]   Well, the child's gonna have to have
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.660]   at least a basic level in German.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.500]   And so if I instruct my children in at least basic German
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.060]   and open up the opportunity, now they can go to Germany,
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.420]   get a highly regarded university degree
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.660]   from a German university,
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.420]   and it can save me a ton of money.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.740]   So there are all kinds of little examples like that
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.220]   where foreign language acquisition can be helpful
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.060]   for your finances, for your family finances.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.400]   This even ignores international tax planning.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.860]   I've spoken extensively about international tax planning.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.020]   One of the best things that you can do,
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.300]   if you can arrange it in your financial planning
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.420]   is to be an international person.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.420]   And so for US Americans who wanna go abroad and work abroad,
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.100]   you can go and you can work abroad.
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.740]   You can often earn a higher level of income.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.620]   You may work in a tax haven and get a favored tax status
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.820]   that allows you to earn a higher level of income
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.060]   and save more money and speed up your path
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.700]   to financial independence.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.120]   If you are involved in banking, international banking,
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.020]   well, you can go and you can live in Dubai
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.540]   and be an international banker in Dubai.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.820]   You can go and live in Singapore
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.180]   or many other places around the world
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.220]   and have a much more efficient tax life
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.820]   by engaging in that kind of career.
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.880]   Now, do you need to speak anything except English
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.860]   to be an international banker in Dubai?
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.500]   Perhaps not, but being proficient in Arabic
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.740]   is certainly gonna help you.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.180]   Or perhaps working for a mutual fund.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.180]   One of my dream jobs when I was younger,
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.940]   on my job list was I wanted to be an analyst,
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.780]   but an in the field analyst
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.420]   for an international mutual fund.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.100]   So I thought it'd be really fun to go and work for,
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.420]   I don't know, a big mutual fund company,
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.980]   maybe like an American Funds or something like that,
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.180]   and work in their Asian investment fund.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.580]   And I'd be the in the field analyst.
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.660]   And I pictured myself traveling all around Asia,
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.740]   doing on the ground research on these companies
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.940]   and trying to figure out where the opportunities were.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.180]   To me, that kind of thing sounds like a dream.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.620]   Super interesting to me, super fun,
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.160]   and would take advantage of my skills, my interests,
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.400]   cross-cultural communications,
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.700]   the challenges that come with that,
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.580]   the fun that comes with it,
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.580]   and mixing kind of the business kinds of things.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.420]   So perhaps a career like that might be interesting to you.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:22.460]   Those are some of the financial reasons for you to consider.
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.940]   Now I wanna pivot and say,
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.840]   let's assume that you are persuaded
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.660]   that there is value in learning a language.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.580]   What language do you learn?
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.900]   How do you answer that?
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.260]   And here I'm gonna do a balancing act,
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.300]   because the answer is you should learn any language
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.220]   that you actually wanna learn.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:44.140]   Because the most important factor in language learning
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.700]   and your ability to learn a language is desire.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.940]   Bar none, that is the single most important factor.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.020]   If you desire to learn a foreign language,
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.600]   you'll figure out how to do it,
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.300]   you'll find the tools and you'll make it happen.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.980]   All around the world,
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.580]   there are hundreds of millions of people who are students
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.480]   who are forced to study a foreign language.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.040]   For those without desire to learn that language,
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.460]   it's a frustration, an annoyance, and a waste of time.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.120]   They go and take two years of Spanish,
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.660]   or two years of French, or two years of English,
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.460]   or whatever it is, and they come out at the other side,
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.580]   and they check the box, they get their high school degree
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.280]   because they did their foreign language studies,
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.700]   but they don't speak the language.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.460]   They can't take on even a basic conversation.
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.900]   They can say bonjour, and that's about it.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.900]   But for those who want to learn it, and who are motivated,
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.560]   those language classes can simply provide them
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.160]   with a foundation that opens up the world
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.400]   of that language to them.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.500]   So if you want the short version,
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.800]   you should just simply study a language
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   that you care about.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.540]   But what if you're a little bit more strategic?
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:59.540]   What if you're interested in choosing things strategically?
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:04.500]   And this has been, for me, my motivation a lot of times
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.700]   with language learning.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.800]   I've never been drawn particularly to a small language group
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.080]   for one specific reason.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.200]   My personal interests have always been more strategic.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.440]   I think strategically, and even most of my goals
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.100]   are often strategic goals.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.880]   They're driven by a sense of strategy.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.200]   I know that's uncommon, but I'll tell you the strategy
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.240]   in case that's also you.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.240]   But if you, you know, there's a Haitian girl
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.620]   that lives next to you and you say,
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.180]   she's really beautiful, I'm interested in her,
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.820]   and that gives you the motivation to learn Creole,
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:38.920]   go for it, right?
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.980]   You engage with something that's interesting to you.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.580]   But what are some of the strategic factors
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.680]   that you can consider?
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.420]   Number one should, of course, be that.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.700]   What interests you?
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:55.700]   If you're a Sinophile, you're deeply interested in China,
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.540]   well, okay, then engage with the Chinese culture.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.260]   You're gonna be much more strategic.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.300]   You're gonna be interested in it
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.300]   because you want it.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.380]   And so that should be your primary foundation,
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.580]   what you actually are interested in.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.060]   Maybe you really love the beach
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.380]   and you see your path to living on the beach
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:19.380]   is running a surf shop on the beach in Brazil.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.220]   Well, Brazilian Portuguese, boom, go for it.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.980]   That should be really important.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.860]   Moving past that, and don't let my brief treatment of it
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.580]   cause you to think it's unimportant,
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.700]   just that that's gotta be your number one thing.
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.500]   But what about bigger strategy?
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.740]   I think one of the biggest things you should consider
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.420]   is where you actually like to be,
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.900]   where you actually enjoy going,
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.340]   or where you might actually want to live.
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.700]   Now, forgive me, I skipped past the,
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:54.700]   well, let me not, sometimes my brain gets ahead of my mouth.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.580]   Where do you wanna go?
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.220]   Where do you want to live?
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:02.620]   Let's say that you are married to a Filipino woman
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.300]   and your financial independence plan
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.420]   involves your moving in retirement to the Philippines
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.180]   and living in an inexpensive but gorgeous house
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.780]   on a little tropical island.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.540]   Well, if you wanna go and live in the Philippines,
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:21.540]   then of course, studying Tagalog or Sabuano
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.300]   or whatever local dialect is appropriate for you
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.700]   would be your priority
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.500]   because you want to go and live there.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.900]   And it would, again, it's very important
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.780]   if you wanna go and live in a certain place
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.780]   to be able to speak the local language.
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.700]   I have done a lot of work in the United States
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.160]   with Spanish speakers.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.180]   And when linguists or analysts
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.860]   are dividing the Spanish-speaking population
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.780]   in the United States, they often will differentiate
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.460]   between what are called acculturated Spanish speakers
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.660]   and unacculturated Spanish speakers.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.380]   An acculturated Spanish speaker
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.540]   is somebody who perhaps they grew up speaking Spanish
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.600]   in their home, perhaps Spanish is their mother tongue,
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.500]   but they went to school in English,
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.420]   they learned English
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.460]   and they're able to speak English effectively.
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.380]   Well, they're going to be part of,
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.440]   they're kind of this dual culture world
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.180]   where they're Cuban culturally or Mexican culturally,
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.460]   but they're fully acculturated
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.700]   into the broader English-speaking American culture.
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.520]   That's very different
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.300]   than an unacculturated Spanish speaker.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.580]   An unacculturated Spanish speaker
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.580]   might be a recent immigrant
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:31.060]   or somebody who's a poorer immigrant.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.740]   Your Cuban grandmother who just lives in Miami
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.700]   and only speaks Spanish with the Cuban,
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.900]   only hangs out with Cubans and Spanish speakers
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.580]   and has no need to learn English,
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:41.740]   no desire to learn English.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.980]   Or a recent day laborer,
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.660]   recently immigrated from Guatemala or Mexico or El Salvador
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.320]   and they haven't been able to learn English yet.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.580]   Well, those people are unacculturated.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.820]   And having worked in these communities,
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.800]   I just have time and time and time and time again
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.260]   seen how limited the opportunities are
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:04.220]   for somebody who is an unacculturated Spanish speaker
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.260]   in the United States.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.620]   I do everything possible
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.940]   when I speak with unacculturated Spanish speakers
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.060]   in the United States to encourage them.
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:17.060]   Your number one job has got to be to learn English.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.580]   For anybody living in the United States
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.420]   who doesn't speak English,
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.500]   your number one job has got to be to learn English
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.620]   because it opens up the world to you.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.140]   Well, the same thing obviously happens in reverse.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.520]   One of the great benefits and blessings and privileges
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.900]   that we as English speakers have
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.340]   is we possess a command of the lingua franca of the world.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.140]   Lingua franca simply means the common language,
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.580]   the language that is used.
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.020]   You can go up to the check-in desk,
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.740]   the reception of any hotel
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.860]   or at least any two or three star and up hotel in the world,
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.860]   and you can just simply speak in English
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.580]   with no need to have a clue about the local language
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:01.580]   and the receptionist will be able to help you and serve you.
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.760]   It's one of the biggest benefits that we have
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.580]   as English speakers and most of us native English speakers.
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.740]   But if you only speak English,
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:15.720]   your experience of the local culture is very limited.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.260]   And you're gonna be financially
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.980]   spending quite a bit of money
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.860]   if your experience of the local culture
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.560]   is if you only speak English.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.380]   The ability to speak at least some of the local language
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.980]   will fundamentally transform your opportunities.
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.140]   And especially if you go to places where it's less common,
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.040]   where English speaking is less common.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.340]   Thinking of places that I've gone,
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.340]   I've traveled a decent amount in Haiti
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.580]   and there was certainly plenty of English speaking,
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.700]   but I spent a lot of time traveling
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.700]   in places that didn't have any English speaking.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.020]   And I don't speak Creole yet,
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.100]   but I do speak some basic French
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.660]   and I was able to get along in French.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.300]   And I remember just simple experiences
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.980]   like figuring out how to negotiate reasonably with guides.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.480]   One of the things that I hated about Haiti
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.780]   is I felt like I was ripped off on every single corner.
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.780]   And the ability to argue in French
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.100]   made all the difference in the world
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.860]   to my being able to get a fair price for what I was doing,
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.140]   for my being able to not get ripped off
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.580]   and saved me a good amount of money.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.580]   And it also allowed me to travel in some unique places
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.260]   that most people don't see.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:31.580]   I remember, this is a little bit of an example,
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:32.940]   but in Haiti, if you ever go to Haiti,
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.940]   there's a cruise port in Haiti called La Badi
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.140]   where the cruise ships come.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.420]   And you can come on a cruise ship
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.860]   and you can have a certain experience.
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:47.860]   But if you go to the same towns, I didn't go to La Badi,
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:51.540]   but I went to some of the towns nearby,
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.980]   there are some incredible things,
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.300]   just some incredible archeology,
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.540]   like just history and culture.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.300]   The thing that most stunned me,
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.900]   there's this incredible rundown palace
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.700]   that was built in Haiti
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.540]   and this incredible fort up on a mountain.
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.380]   The palace is called the Palace of Saint-Souci
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.820]   and the fort is called the Citadel.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.980]   And it's this incredible thing built
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.660]   in the middle of nowhere, Haiti,
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:21.580]   that you gotta be a pretty intrepid traveler to go to.
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.820]   And so I would never have had the confidence
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.300]   to go and travel around Haiti
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.620]   and experience some of the incredible experiences
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.700]   that I had there if I didn't speak basic French,
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.340]   because English was not widely spoken
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.100]   in the places where I went.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.820]   Now, when I was in Port-au-Prince
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.260]   and staying at the, forget the name of it,
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.020]   the big five-star hotel there,
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.580]   certainly English was all I needed.
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.260]   But to go out of that,
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.380]   you need something that will work in the local language.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.540]   And so it changes your transformation.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.380]   So where do you wanna go?
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.660]   Where do you wanna live?
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:51.500]   Now, part of this,
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.020]   you need to consider what cultures you fit well with,
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.500]   what cultures you like.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.140]   And I think many of us will have,
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.580]   if we're actually honest,
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:02.180]   we'll have an attraction in a certain direction.
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.220]   Give me an example.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.500]   I've always found a deep level of comfort in Latin cultures.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.340]   I grew up in South Florida,
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.300]   lots of friends from Latin cultures.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.500]   And Latin culture for me is a very attractive culture.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.940]   It's a very conservative culture,
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.420]   a very family-oriented culture,
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.860]   very religious culture,
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.860]   heavily Catholic, heavily Christian.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:26.180]   And it's always been very comfortable for me.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.980]   And so there was a natural fit.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.740]   I could live easily in Latin America
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.660]   and be totally comfortable with it
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.140]   because of more of a cultural familiarity.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.300]   I don't have that same feeling with regard to Asia.
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.660]   I enjoy traveling in Asia.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.820]   Asia is just an incredible place.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.900]   I enjoy it,
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.340]   but I don't have that same level of cultural connection.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.460]   Now, part of that, of course, I'm sure,
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.860]   is due to lack of language ability.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.140]   And so I don't have any ability in any Asian language.
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.300]   I don't speak Mandarin,
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.220]   I don't speak Cantonese,
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.260]   I don't speak Japanese,
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.100]   I don't speak Korean,
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.620]   I don't speak any of those languages yet.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.660]   And so I'm aware that perhaps
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.300]   my connection with Latin America
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.300]   is due to having language ability in Spanish and Portuguese
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:18.300]   rather than an Asian language.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:22.940]   But I'm more interested in learning Latin languages
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.540]   than I am Asian languages
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.100]   because of the affinity,
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.300]   the sense of cultural connection.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.340]   Which comes first,
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.340]   the language ability or the cultural connection?
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.260]   No idea, no idea.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.220]   But I do know that for me,
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.940]   it's a higher priority for me
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.580]   to develop skill in Latin languages
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.340]   than it is in Asian languages
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.980]   because I just enjoy the culture more.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.500]   I'm more naturally motivated there.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.020]   I know that I could happily live in Latin America
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.660]   if I ever wanted to,
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:57.660]   but that's different than Asia.
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.180]   So perhaps it's different for you.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.220]   Perhaps you really love Thai culture
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.420]   or you really love Japanese culture.
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.980]   Well, then you should study that, obviously,
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.540]   because it's incredibly valuable.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:14.180]   Now, what about some of the economic considerations?
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:18.060]   I'm convinced one of the great career strategy
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:23.060]   is to use languages to open up a path forward for you.
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.540]   You can do this in your home country.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.580]   In the previous show,
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.500]   I talked about the value of speaking Spanish
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.100]   as an American, as a US American.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.980]   The United States is estimated,
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.900]   right now the United States is the fifth most populous
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.380]   Spanish-speaking country in the world.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.020]   I think it's, if my memory is right,
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:42.860]   correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.020]   but I'm pretty sure the most populous,
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.020]   where there's the country
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.100]   that has the most Spanish speakers in it right now
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.980]   is Mexico, followed by, I think, Argentina,
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.500]   then Colombia, then Spain, and then the United States.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.340]   The United States, I think,
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.460]   is the fifth most populated country with Spanish speakers.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.060]   However, within the next couple of decades,
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.700]   the United States is expected to become
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.420]   the second most populous Spanish-speaking country
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.260]   in the world, and second only to Mexico.
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.140]   Mexico is projected to have a larger population,
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.420]   but in the coming decades, I can't remember,
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:18.940]   I think it's by 2050,
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.380]   the United States is projected to be the second,
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.540]   the country in the world, the second most,
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.220]   my English is failing me,
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:30.380]   the country in the world with the second highest number
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.660]   of Spanish speakers.
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.620]   So if you want the ability to improve
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.340]   your career prospects in the United States,
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.300]   then the ability to speak in Spanish
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.260]   will be very interesting to you, very useful to you.
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.740]   In addition, there might be local cultures.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.100]   So there are regions in the United States
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.060]   with a lot of Haitian immigrants.
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.140]   That was in South Florida,
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.300]   there are lots of Haitian immigrants.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.100]   And so you might wanna pick up Creole
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.220]   because it allows you to work effectively
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.060]   in the Haitian community.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.100]   Or maybe you live in the Midwest
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.100]   where there's a lot of Somali immigrants, right?
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.300]   So you may study Somali or some other local language
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.140]   that there's a large population,
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.020]   that sets you apart in the local area.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.300]   But I think a more interesting strategy for a lot of us,
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.740]   or at least a lot of us who enjoy international relocation,
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:21.540]   would be to choose a language of a region
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.140]   that you want to actually go to.
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:28.340]   Because when you leave your home culture
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.980]   and go somewhere else,
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.300]   you have the ability to upgrade your status.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.820]   You have the ability to move
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.620]   from an ordinary everyday middle-class person
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.860]   and move more easily into the upper crust,
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.500]   upper class of a local society.
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.060]   I've experienced this many times.
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.100]   There's a huge benefit to being a white man
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.620]   traveling around the world.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.620]   You can go to many cultures in the world
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.860]   and you can go to the swankiest of hotels,
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.260]   and you can be let right in.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:06.260]   You can gain access to the highest crust of society
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.500]   if you're outside of your home culture.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.220]   When you're in your home culture,
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.580]   for example, if I'm in the United States,
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.380]   I'm one of about a bazillion.
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.300]   Now, can I, if I really want to gain access
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.540]   to the glitterati,
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.500]   if I really want to engage in the upper crust society,
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.340]   can I do it?
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.180]   Of course I can.
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:24.660]   I've had friends who've done this very effectively.
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.820]   They don't move to Washington, DC,
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.980]   don't know a soul,
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.980]   but they're very intentional with their networking.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.780]   They go to the right places, to the right events,
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:32.740]   make the right connections,
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:35.020]   and move their way up into society.
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:35.860]   You can do that.
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.740]   For me, it's always been easy in an international context.
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.220]   If I go into the bar at the swanky hotel
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.300]   in any city in the world,
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.100]   any international city in the world,
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.740]   you meet the most remarkable of people
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:49.740]   and open up the most interesting of conversations.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:52.740]   And it very quickly moves you
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.100]   from just an ordinary common person
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.420]   into a unique kind of upper level person.
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.900]   I've recommended this routinely to a number of people.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.940]   And so I really think you should consider it.
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.860]   If you're just an average, ordinary person,
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.020]   if you're having trouble distinguishing yourself
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.300]   or setting yourself apart in your home culture,
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.980]   you should very seriously consider becoming an expat
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.700]   because the expat community
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.780]   in almost any country in the world
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.420]   is by definition smaller than the home country.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.720]   And so if you, let's say that you are,
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.340]   I don't know, Italian, right?
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.880]   If you're an Italian living in Italy,
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.260]   you're one of about, not a bazillion,
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.700]   but one of several million.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.820]   It's very hard to set yourself apart.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:43.100]   But if you're an Italian and you move to Miami,
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.940]   well, now you're very attractive, right?
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.700]   You're unique, you're exotic, you're interesting.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:53.540]   And if you shore up that basic ethnic difference,
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.320]   or you shore up that basic linguistic difference,
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.540]   and you shore that up with excellence and knowledge
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.460]   and business skills, et cetera,
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.120]   you'll find that the world opens up for you.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.220]   So if you're a US American living in the United States,
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:13.580]   then you should seriously consider going somewhere else,
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.020]   somewhere where you'll be exotic,
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.320]   somewhere where you'll be,
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.940]   where you get some benefits for the way that you speak.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.860]   You get some benefits for the color of your skin,
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.420]   get some benefits for that.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.780]   And you can very quickly move yourself
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.540]   into an upper level of society.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.740]   I even find this interesting from the perspective
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.140]   of changing your cultural identity.
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:38.540]   If you are part of a mainstream school system,
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.500]   let's say that, I've often thought,
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.740]   let's say that I were the parent of a,
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.220]   I don't know, 13 or 14 year old student.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.300]   And that 13 or 14 year old student
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.060]   were really struggling in the local school context.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.740]   And let's assume that I don't have,
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:53.820]   the student is actually,
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.460]   let's just say I'm coaching the student.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.900]   One of the things I would say to the student would be,
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.820]   you should consider just simply dropping out
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.460]   of the place that you're located,
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.940]   drop out of the place where you're bullied,
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.960]   drop out of the place where you're not cool,
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.520]   go through some set of transformation, right?
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.420]   Start lifting weights, become stronger, get less fat,
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.980]   get a haircut, dress differently or something,
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.860]   and pick yourself up and go to another context
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.120]   and start over, reinvent yourself.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.820]   Well, that would be obviously decent advice
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.460]   for an open-minded student,
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:26.260]   because they can move into a new system,
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.940]   start a new social group and start over.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.060]   But you can do the same thing as an adult.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.140]   You can do the same thing.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.200]   And you could do this within your state.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:39.200]   You live in Columbus, Ohio, and you're a loser,
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.460]   life stinks for you, everything is bad,
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:46.300]   you're surrounded by a bunch of losers.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:50.500]   Well, pack the car and move to Chicago and start over
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.820]   and transform yourself along the way.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.180]   Get a haircut, change the way you,
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.360]   change the clothes that you wear,
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.280]   change the way that you speak,
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.480]   change the type of people that you build friendships with,
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.940]   change the types of things that you can do,
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.780]   and you can totally reinvent yourself.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.700]   And it's easier sometimes to do that
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.060]   if you move into another context.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.620]   You can do the same thing internationally.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.040]   So if you're living in Columbus, Ohio,
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.200]   and you are a total loser,
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.100]   and nothing is going well for you,
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:26.100]   maybe what you do is you study Swahili, right?
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.540]   And you move to Nairobi,
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.140]   and you get yourself a job working
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:35.240]   with an import-export company doing business in Nairobi.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.620]   Well, pretty quickly, I can promise you,
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:39.660]   especially if you'll be thoughtful and strategic
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.340]   about the way that you present yourself,
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:47.340]   you can be in the very upper crust of elite society
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.820]   in Nairobi with that move.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.120]   So consider it.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.560]   This is especially important, I think,
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.300]   if you are the victim of some form of systematized
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.200]   oppression or discrimination,
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.500]   or if you're in great danger.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.420]   Maybe you are part of a stigmatized group.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:10.620]   Maybe you're one of the, I don't know,
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.460]   the outcasts, right, lower castes in India.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.420]   If you move outside of India,
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.060]   and you move to Germany or the United States,
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.000]   if you can figure out how to make that translation,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.180]   which is tough, right,
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.780]   not easy to immigrate to those places,
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.460]   but you can very quickly leave
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.000]   that cultural baggage behind you.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.500]   Maybe you are, right now in the United States,
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.820]   there's all this tremendous racial tension
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.660]   specifically for black people.
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.120]   Perhaps you should consider moving
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.180]   outside of the United States
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.580]   and moving to some place where that black identity
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.540]   is not a problem, maybe it is a problem
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.380]   for you in the United States,
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.980]   and move somewhere where it's better.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.140]   There's a YouTube channel that I've watched called,
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.020]   I think it's called the Melanin Files
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.580]   or the Melanated Files,
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:57.140]   and I'm super interested in it.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.600]   And I listen to all these black people that live in Asia,
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.780]   and I watched this interview with a professor,
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.420]   a college professor who had spent,
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.300]   had been living in Japan.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.420]   He grew up in the United States,
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.220]   then moved to Japan 40 years ago.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.820]   And he just talked about how he really appreciated
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.380]   his freedom as a black man living in Japan
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:20.540]   and how for him, it had been a wonderful experience.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:23.900]   And so that might be a strategy that is helpful for you.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.020]   And I see those kinds of things
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.180]   as really, really useful for you to consider.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.740]   So if you're attracted in another direction,
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.620]   then consider where you might wanna go
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:39.620]   where you could become exotic and become sought after
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:43.380]   instead of being normal or being oppressed
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:45.300]   or discriminated against.
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.860]   Can be extremely, extremely useful for you.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.560]   This can be useful on multiple levels,
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:55.220]   depending on the kind of discrimination you're facing
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.540]   or depending on the kind of persecution you're facing.
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.780]   Perhaps you're a religious minority
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.700]   in your country of birth.
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.460]   Well, you may not be a religious minority in another place.
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.980]   Perhaps you are,
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.900]   and again, we talked about ethnicity or an ethnic minority.
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.220]   You might be celebrated in another place
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:17.220]   because of your exotic ethnic identity
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.020]   rather than oppressed because of your ethnic identity.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.140]   This can come into play with even with regard to age.
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:28.100]   I think of someone like,
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:32.140]   I don't know, I think of the climate activist,
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.780]   Greta Thunberg, right?
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.140]   Now, of course, she, I think,
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.020]   is somewhat celebrated in her home culture,
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:41.220]   but here's this young woman, right?
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.140]   Is she a teenager yet?
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.620]   Very young woman who on the international stage
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:50.620]   is this incredibly popular, adored figure
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:53.020]   on an international stage,
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.300]   but if she were to go to her local hometown
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.180]   and spend time there,
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.660]   she's just, hey, the little girl next door.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.700]   And so you may be able to use that to your benefit
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:05.860]   if you're suffering age discrimination for your youth
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.100]   or even for your age.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:13.100]   You can, let's say you're an intelligent,
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.580]   retired 65-year-old.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.740]   Well, maybe the United States wants to brush you aside
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:19.700]   as being over the hill,
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.700]   but you can take that same identity
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.420]   and you can move into another culture
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.380]   and you may be celebrated for your age
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.180]   and respected and honored for your age
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.980]   instead of discriminated against for your age.
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.900]   So if you're facing something like that,
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.860]   consider is there a strategy of relocation?
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.580]   Is there somewhere that I can go
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.860]   that would allow me to be celebrated for who I am,
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.660]   become an exotic, attractive,
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:45.620]   person of special value instead of just a commodity?
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.460]   Might be very, very useful for you.
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.340]   What are some other factors that you should consider
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:55.540]   specifically with regard to the finances of it?
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.700]   Well, here, I wanna give you some things I learned
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.300]   when I was researching this a while ago.
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.980]   I stumbled upon a report from the United Kingdom
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:08.980]   and the report is called "Languages for the Future,
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.500]   "The Foreign Languages the United Kingdom Needs
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.300]   "to Become a Truly Global Nation."
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.180]   This is put out by the British Council.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.380]   And thus far, there are two versions of this report.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.060]   They first published the report in 2013
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.020]   and then in 2017, they updated the report,
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:27.140]   especially in light of a post-Brexit vote.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.500]   And the basic idea is the British Council
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:33.500]   is the UK's international organization
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.780]   for cultural relations and educational opportunities.
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.660]   So the British Council is active all around the world
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:42.460]   to promote British culture and British engagement.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.220]   They do English language tests all around the world
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.380]   and various cultural forms of outreach
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.380]   run international schools, et cetera.
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.500]   And I really liked the report
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.340]   because the report was very strategic
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:00.340]   in how it laid out what international languages
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.620]   UK citizens would need.
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.140]   Now, I've not found a similar version of this
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.980]   from the United States, it might exist,
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.140]   but I thought this was good.
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:13.340]   And the huge benefit that you and I have
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.380]   is being English speakers.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.580]   The obvious first, second language
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:23.060]   that anybody who is not an English speaker
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.380]   would want to learn would be English.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.020]   And that's where you and I have a huge leg up
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:31.380]   being English speakers or being native English speakers,
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.660]   many of us.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.100]   It gives us a tremendous headstart on the world
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:40.580]   when you speak the world's lingua franca by its definition,
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.060]   but naturally or with less effort.
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:47.700]   It's a tremendous privilege on a global basis.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.020]   If you are not, if you don't speak English,
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:53.340]   that would of course be your first, second language.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.420]   No matter where you in the world you are,
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.700]   no matter what you do,
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:01.180]   English is the current international language of business.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:04.860]   English is the current international language of diplomacy.
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.180]   English is the current international language,
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.820]   the most influential language in the world.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.260]   It's the fastest growing language in the world,
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.180]   both in terms of number of speakers
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.740]   and in terms of the lexicon of the English language.
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.780]   It's the largest language in the world with the most words.
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.380]   English has a bigger lexicon
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.660]   than any other language in the world,
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.460]   and it's the fastest growing lexicon in the world.
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.420]   And so being an English speaker
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.060]   and being a fluent English speaker
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.700]   would be without question the highest priority
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.420]   for anybody who didn't speak English.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.540]   But of course you're listening to this podcast in English,
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.780]   so you of course do speak English.
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:42.620]   So where do you go?
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.020]   What do you do next?
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.900]   Well, I like the way that this report
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.020]   from the United Kingdom laid out
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:52.420]   some of the points of analysis,
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.720]   because for me, these points of analysis have always been,
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:02.900]   they've been my areas of focus for my personal languages.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:06.020]   For me, the biggest factor has always been,
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:08.660]   where do the most people speak it, and who am I around?
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.540]   I don't deny that you should start
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:11.580]   with the language you're interested in.
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:15.540]   If you're really interested in Tamil as a language
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:20.540]   or Punjab, right, Punjab or Punjabi as a language,
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:25.060]   then you would study that because you're interested in it.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.560]   But for me, I've always had this dream
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.940]   of being able to travel around the world
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.700]   and speak the most spoken languages.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.300]   And although English is the global lingua franca,
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.700]   there are of course languages
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:38.700]   that are going to be regionalized languages.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:43.260]   And so a language like Russian is very influential
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.820]   around the former Soviet Union,
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.060]   even if the local language is different than Russian,
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.300]   or Spanish is very influential.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.540]   French, the lingua franca of the world before English
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.120]   is extremely useful.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.700]   Tremendous numbers of French speakers all around the world.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:59.740]   You can use it in Africa, you can use it in the Caribbean,
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:02.300]   you can use it in, a little bit in South America,
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.340]   you can use it all across Europe.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:06.900]   It's just a tremendously useful language.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.620]   But for me, strategically,
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.700]   this is where you might wanna consider,
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:10.940]   especially if you're interested
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.780]   in expanding your employment opportunities,
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.580]   your income opportunities,
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:18.060]   perhaps even your business opportunities.
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.700]   You wanna go and make investments in foreign countries,
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.220]   or you wanna run a highly profitable
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:24.060]   international business.
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:26.820]   These languages are languages that you should consider.
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:29.300]   And this method of analysis is a method of analysis
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.700]   that you should consider and apply to your local country,
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.780]   to your local opportunities.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.620]   A quick note on entrepreneurship.
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.780]   In my travels around the world,
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:43.140]   I've become convinced that one of the most reliable ways
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:47.300]   of building a fortune is simply to take a concept,
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.980]   a business, a profession that has been successful
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.260]   in one region of the world,
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.740]   and take that to another region of the world and expand it.
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.980]   You can, if you are from Germany,
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.260]   you can look around the German culture
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.820]   and you can find businesses that have been very effective
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.420]   and you can take those to other places.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.020]   Now, these may be bigger businesses.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.700]   When I was in college, I considered taking a job
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.660]   with a cell phone company that was working in Africa,
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.180]   and they were expanding all around Africa.
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.620]   I had a friend who was working for them,
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.100]   and I thought it was interesting.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.180]   I chose not to do it at the time,
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:23.700]   but that was a phase at which,
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.540]   if I went and worked with a global telecom provider,
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:29.100]   they were just expanding massively around the world.
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.660]   I don't know if there are still opportunities
[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.300]   in the telecom space,
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.260]   but I guarantee you there are opportunities
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.460]   in the real estate space.
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:37.820]   I've had several friends of mine
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:39.180]   who've been real estate agents in the United States,
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.500]   and I've told them, I said, "Listen,
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.140]   "you need to simply leave the United States,
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.540]   "go to a place that you think you would enjoy doing,
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.260]   "and take some of the practices
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.580]   "and some of the standards
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:50.220]   "of the real estate business in the United States,
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.460]   "which is highly developed,
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.300]   "and take those into the local context."
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.100]   Just simply doing a good job with online listings
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.260]   and doing really excellent photos
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:00.980]   and providing really good customer service.
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.420]   You could set yourself apart and build
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:06.140]   an extremely successful real estate brokerage
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.860]   that could be national in scope.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.220]   Take a highly successful model,
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.740]   take a Keller Williams,
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.540]   and just go and take that concept to another country
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.700]   that doesn't have a large national real estate brand,
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:19.380]   and focus on building that,
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.340]   and figure out what are the cultural factors
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:23.940]   that you can cross over,
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:28.060]   and what do you bring that's good from an American model,
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:29.000]   and then what do you pick up
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.140]   that's good from the local culture,
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.380]   and establish it.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.820]   And those opportunities are all around the world.
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:39.820]   So, having these language abilities is extremely useful.
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:44.200]   Now, I'm just gonna summarize this report for you,
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.220]   because they give a number of different factors.
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.740]   First, I'll tell you what the factors are.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.780]   I'll tell you the top languages from this report,
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.300]   and then I'll briefly discuss what these factors are,
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.240]   because these are factors
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.420]   that you can apply to your country.
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:02.420]   Perhaps you're listening to me in Germany.
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:06.920]   Well, you can do this analysis for you in Germany,
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.400]   different than the United Kingdom,
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.480]   or any country in the world.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:15.480]   So, here are the factors that this report goes into.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:19.800]   There are three broad organizing themes.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.820]   Number one is economic factors.
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:26.440]   Number two is non-market factors.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.840]   And then number three, balancing factors.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.160]   So, the economic factors are, in this case,
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.760]   again, this report coming from the UK,
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.000]   the current UK exports.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.400]   And specifically what this means is
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.960]   the countries that the United Kingdom
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.040]   has the closest trading relationship with.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.760]   And this would be something
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.400]   that would be worth your looking into.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:53.320]   What country does your home country,
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.840]   or your country of residence,
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:58.600]   have the closest trading opportunities with?
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.520]   And you should look at that.
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.960]   Number two would be the language needs of,
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.360]   in this case, UK businesses, but for your local country.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.760]   What are the language needs of businesses?
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.880]   What do businesses say, this is who we're looking for?
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.760]   Are they looking for a Polish speaker?
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.360]   Are they looking for a Hindi speaker?
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.200]   Number three is future trade priorities.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.920]   So, what regions in the world
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.400]   is that country trying to build trade?
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.520]   If you're living in the United States,
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.920]   you would not be trying to learn Farsi
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:29.720]   for the benefits of trading opportunities.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.960]   Farsi, of course, the language from Iran.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:35.160]   And although Iran has a huge population
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.960]   and has possibly tremendous economic potential,
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.360]   because of the very difficult relationship
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.920]   between Iran and the United States,
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.440]   that's not something where you would expect
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.440]   to necessarily get a job,
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.080]   unless, I guess, you wanna be involved with,
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.440]   be a spy, work for the CIA, or something like that.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.560]   Number four economic factor
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.560]   is emerging high growth markets.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:56.280]   So, which markets are growing the fastest?
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.280]   Now, what about the non-market factors?
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.360]   Here, there are four of them,
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.560]   diplomatic and security priorities.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.800]   Again, where are the priorities of this country?
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.120]   What countries in the world is your country
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.880]   trying to strengthen ties with?
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.080]   Because those ties may start with diplomacy,
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:17.880]   but business ties are quickly going to grow.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.480]   What countries is your country
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.520]   trying to build stronger business ties,
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.480]   negotiate trade agreements, et cetera, with?
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.520]   Next would be the public's language interests.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:32.400]   Is this language growing because it's of popularity?
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.280]   Here, you would look at a language like, say, Spanish,
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:39.200]   which has, what, something like 500 million speakers
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.040]   around the world.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.720]   You would say that this is a very popular language
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.960]   all around the world.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.640]   It's growing in popularity.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:49.280]   It's a very active second language.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.600]   And you would compare that to a language that's dying.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.520]   I don't know, maybe Maltese, right?
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.280]   Maltese is an interesting language,
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.840]   but it's not spoken outside of Malta.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:02.640]   And in Malta, it's not a big priority
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.760]   compared to the widespread use of English
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:05.840]   or other languages.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.320]   I think, what, half a million speakers of Maltese
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:12.440]   and probably dying in terms of its overall influence.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.240]   So, the public's language interests.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.640]   Number three, non-market factors,
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.160]   outward and inward tourism.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.360]   Where are their ties?
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.760]   Where are their connections for you?
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.000]   Number four would be international educational engagement.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.040]   And then the last two are the balancing factors,
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.280]   levels of English proficiency in other countries,
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.160]   and then the prevalence of different languages
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.960]   on the internet.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:37.960]   So, let's talk about what the UK's list of 10 languages are.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.720]   And here they are.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.320]   Number one is Spanish.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.720]   So, the British Council would encourage you
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.440]   that if you're interested, sorry.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:51.360]   The British Council would encourage policy makers in the UK
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:56.360]   to deeply emphasize Spanish as a foreign language.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:54:00.560]   And their reasoning, if it's sound,
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.600]   would be good reasons for you
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.320]   to consider Spanish as a foreign language.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:07.600]   This is true in the United Kingdom.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.640]   I think this would especially be true in the United States.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:15.600]   Unless you simply have no interest in Spanish at all,
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.200]   it's hard to see why, if you are US American,
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.040]   why Spanish wouldn't be your first, second language.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.560]   Because there are so many speakers of it available,
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.520]   and because the United States ties
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:32.040]   with Spanish-speaking countries are incredibly high.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.680]   Obviously, Mexico, all of Latin America,
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.840]   and there are so many Spanish speakers,
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.160]   immigrants to the United States,
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.200]   that Spanish would be obvious.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.720]   Number one would be Spanish.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.080]   Number two would be Mandarin Chinese,
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.640]   the official language of China,
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.920]   the national language.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.120]   Of course, there are many local dialects,
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.920]   but Mandarin Chinese would be the number two language
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:55.280]   that UK speakers would encourage other people to learn.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.640]   And I think that this would be obvious for many people.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.200]   Because of the massive population of China,
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.200]   because of the economic clout of China,
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.080]   I think many people see the value
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.200]   of learning Mandarin Chinese.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:11.240]   Among the hoity-toity, kind of upper-level elite
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.240]   in the United States,
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.320]   Mandarin Chinese is certainly a high priority.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.160]   Number three is French.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:22.680]   Classic language, that would be the United Kingdom's,
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:24.080]   the British Council's encouragement
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.120]   for language to consider.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.440]   Number four is Arabic,
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.360]   and the number five are German.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:32.960]   And so they've assigned a points margin for these things,
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.000]   and those five are the clear winners.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.560]   Now, you could speak all five of them
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.760]   if you're interested in it.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.200]   Spanish, if you're an English speaker,
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.560]   Spanish, French, and German
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.280]   will be your easiest languages to learn
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.760]   in terms of the amount of time.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.600]   Maybe not to learn well,
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.360]   some complex conjugations in those languages,
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:56.440]   but you'll have the most cognates across those languages.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.120]   So you can learn Spanish, French, and German.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.680]   I find that for me, when I learn Spanish,
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:03.640]   I can go over as an English speaker
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.280]   with a very broad vocabulary,
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.440]   and as a Spanish speaker with a pretty decent vocabulary,
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:13.200]   I can go to French and I can read 90% of French
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:16.000]   without the need to do anything,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.720]   maybe a little bit more than 90%.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.120]   Good connection over to German.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.800]   Mandarin and Arabic, of course,
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:27.400]   much more distant from English and the Romance languages,
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.400]   but certainly very doable.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:33.600]   Now, the next five languages are Italian, Dutch,
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.640]   Portuguese, Japanese, and Russian.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.320]   So again, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Japanese, and Russian.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:44.040]   Having very high benefits for UK residents
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.080]   to learn to speak those,
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.280]   and I'm talking specifically economic benefits
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.800]   to increase trade, increase job opportunities, et cetera.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.800]   And then some good runners up
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.800]   would include Turkish, Polish, Malay,
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:58.440]   and possibly Hindi for the United Kingdom.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.200]   So there's your list of languages,
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.760]   and perhaps there's one or a few of them
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:03.640]   that you would consider,
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.800]   but if you are not living in the UK,
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.760]   then you should perform this similar kind of analysis.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:12.200]   Although I mentioned the factors,
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.520]   let me give you the, let me go over them again for you.
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.240]   The economic factors to begin with.
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.800]   Number one is be the current exports
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.640]   from your country to another country.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.640]   And this would be obvious.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.800]   If you're gonna go and get a job,
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:24.960]   let's say you're gonna get a job
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.360]   as a bilingual social media manager.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.960]   There's lots of those jobs out there available,
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.800]   but it's gonna be much more,
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.640]   there's gonna be more demand for your services
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:37.380]   if you're bilingual in a language
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:40.720]   that your country is exporting a lot of business to.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.360]   So by this factor, you can just simply look up
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.680]   where does your country trade the most with.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.200]   For the United Kingdom, it's the United States,
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.720]   Germany, France, Netherlands, Ireland,
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:54.000]   Switzerland, Italy, China, the Gulf,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.640]   and Arab states, Belgium, Spain, Japan, et cetera.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.400]   And then analyze the languages of those.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.840]   You don't have to go for the first one
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:01.880]   if you're not interested in it,
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:05.140]   but if you're interested in Mandarin Chinese,
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.040]   and China is a very strong trading partner
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.000]   of a company, that's a good sign.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   So what are the companies that your country demands?
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:19.020]   What countries?
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:21.220]   And also, what's growing?
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:22.920]   Where is the, what's growing?
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:27.920]   So for example, in 2017, the British Council Report
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.640]   recommended these languages
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.340]   in terms of being more interesting.
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.200]   German, French, Dutch, Italian, Mandarin,
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.160]   Arabic, Spanish, Japanese, Swedish, and Cantonese.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:44.160]   But there was a big change in Swedish.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.920]   Swedish became less important in 2017.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.820]   Major change in other analyses in Portuguese
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:52.960]   being less important because of the challenges
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.960]   in the Brazilian economy.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.140]   Similar things with Russian.
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:57.940]   2013, Russia was very important,
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:00.960]   but Russia declined significantly in terms of,
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.920]   it actually dropped off that top 10 list
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.840]   because of the problems in the Russian economy
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:09.320]   over the last half a decade to the decade.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:11.500]   So do that analysis.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.040]   Indicated number two, the language needs
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.900]   of businesses of your company.
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:18.160]   In the United Kingdom, there are,
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.800]   the report looks for a study and they say,
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:23.560]   okay, what business, what languages do we say that we need?
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:25.560]   And in this case, the list was French, German,
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.320]   Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, Polish, Dutch,
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:29.080]   Japanese, Cantonese, Russian.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.120]   But there's a major difference in terms of the demand
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.160]   for French speakers and German speakers
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:36.040]   than there is for Russian speakers.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:38.120]   Third factor, economic factor,
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:41.080]   is the government's trade priorities.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.080]   So where are the government's trade priorities?
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.760]   And the way that the British Council analyzed this
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:49.140]   was to look at the markets identified
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:52.680]   by the UK Foreign Service for international trade
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.080]   and to identify those specific places.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.940]   And it's interesting because this is the area
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.640]   where you get some of these smaller languages
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.160]   that don't often reach the top level,
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.720]   but they are very, very useful.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.600]   So let's say that your country is trying
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.640]   to build connections in Africa.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.360]   A good example here, maybe you're living in China
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.940]   and you speak Mandarin Chinese, possibly a local dialect,
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:20.440]   but you recognize that, and you also speak English,
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:25.280]   but you recognize that your country, your nation, China,
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.200]   is working very diligently to expand into Africa.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.880]   Well, then you would look at a language like Swahili, right?
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.240]   Swahili is the lingua franca
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.520]   of much of Eastern and Southeastern Africa.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:41.160]   And so that would be possibly a good language to prioritize
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.520]   or possibly French, which would be more common
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.600]   in Northern and Central Africa.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.120]   And if you had a specific local area,
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.920]   a specific local dialect that were gonna be interesting
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.180]   to you in a specific country,
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:55.780]   then of course you would pursue that.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:59.120]   But Swahili wouldn't be on the top 10 list,
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.800]   but it might be for you.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.360]   So consider that.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.480]   The top 10, what about indicator number four,
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.480]   emerging high growth markets.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:12.480]   So here, the analysis simply, where is growth expected?
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.880]   And I believe that this is an under-discussed area
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:20.160]   where you can look at regions of the world
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.320]   and you can see where growth is expected
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:27.400]   for the UK analysis from the Center for Economics
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.400]   and Business Research in the United Kingdom.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.600]   They would say that these are some of the 10 regions
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.720]   of the world of the highest growth area.
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.440]   India, India, official languages of India,
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.440]   Hindi and English.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.340]   Vietnam, language Vietnamese.
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.200]   Ghana, language English.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.840]   Indonesia, language Bahasa Indonesia or Malay.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.040]   China, Mandarin.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.240]   Malaysia, Malay.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.240]   Thailand, Thai.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.740]   United Arab Emirates, Arabic.
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:52.800]   Turkey, Turkish.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.520]   Poland and Polish.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.280]   And so I think that one of the most interesting things
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.200]   you can do with your business,
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.840]   with your investments,
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.180]   is to try to get in front of a macro trend.
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:11.560]   Try to look at it and say, where is the macro trend?
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:15.840]   If you were to compare the Vietnamese economy
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.840]   to the UK economy or the US American economy,
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.240]   there's probably a much higher growth potential
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.680]   in the Vietnamese economy than there is
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.160]   the American or the UK economy.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.200]   That doesn't mean that there aren't good opportunities
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.080]   in both, but the overall potential of the economy,
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.760]   there's a lot more room for it to run.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.180]   And so in high growth markets,
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.000]   that might be something really interesting
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   for you to focus on.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.160]   In the United States, a place like Mexico, right?
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.320]   There's a lot more growth potential in Mexico
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.760]   than there is in the United States.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.760]   In Africa, a place like Nigeria,
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.940]   you have this huge population and growing population
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.440]   as compared to the declining population
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.760]   in many of the countries in the West.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.380]   And so you might want to think about that
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.320]   and figure out where your options are.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.000]   So what they do in this analysis
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.520]   is they assign points to those factors,
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.480]   they weight those points,
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:17.480]   and then they use those to provide a numerical ranking.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.960]   What about non-economic factors?
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.600]   Cultural, educational, diplomatic, and security factors?
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.320]   Well, you could look at what are the languages
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.200]   that are of priority for diplomacy.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:33.760]   And so in the United Kingdom,
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.360]   they did some interviews and found out
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.800]   that the priority one languages,
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.080]   which are languages of the United Nations,
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.960]   involve Arabic, French, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.520]   And the priority two languages for UK residents
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.280]   would be Farsi, German, Japanese, Korean,
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.120]   Portuguese, and Turkish.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.220]   Next indicator would be the public's language interests.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:57.260]   So what languages are the public people most interested in?
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.220]   Here, Spanish, Italian, French, German, Mandarin,
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:03.260]   Japanese, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, and Polish.
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.860]   And number seven would be tourism
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.740]   and other overseas visits.
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:09.380]   If you're living in a place,
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.860]   one of the simplest things that you can do
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:12.380]   to differentiate yourself is let's say
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.240]   that you're living in a place
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.700]   that has a significant draw of tourists.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.620]   Well, you can learn a foreign language
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:22.620]   and then market yourself as that tourist services provider
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:25.200]   to that specific language group.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.780]   And there are tons of tour guides
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:31.420]   that make their living in New York City or in Sao Paolo
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:34.060]   because they speak Japanese.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:36.780]   And the Japanese tourists that love to come to Sao Paolo,
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:39.780]   that's the automatic tour agency that they would use
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:41.820]   because they're specialized in that.
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:43.900]   And then priorities for international education,
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:45.460]   international mobility of students,
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:48.740]   and then languages needed for cultural education,
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:53.420]   diplomatic and security purposes,
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.860]   and moving fast for time.
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:57.120]   Which brings me to the last one, table 12,
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.740]   levels of English proficiency.
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:01.080]   One of the more interesting balancing factors
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.540]   that they bring in is how common is English
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.040]   in these particular languages?
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.860]   Because if you already speak English
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:12.680]   and you want to live in a certain country,
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.200]   but English is widely spoken there,
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:17.180]   you may not need to spend your time
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.040]   learning that particular language.
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.580]   So for example,
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:26.100]   places of very high English proficiency on this list,
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.180]   very high, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland,
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.600]   Singapore, and Luxembourg.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.980]   If I wanted to live in the Netherlands, would I learn Dutch?
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.660]   I would learn Dutch,
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:39.380]   but there wouldn't be as nearly of a pressing need
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:43.580]   to learn Dutch as if I'm living in Mongolia.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:48.420]   Mongolia has a very low level of English proficiency.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.540]   I really need to speak Mongolian if I'm living in Mongolia.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.220]   I don't really need to speak English
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.940]   if I'm living in the Netherlands.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:58.340]   And so, now me personally liking languages
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.220]   and wanting to really connect with a culture
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.060]   and wanting to be able to cross those cultural barriers,
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:05.380]   I would, but if I'm just learning languages,
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:08.500]   I wouldn't encourage my children,
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.100]   you really need to learn Dutch.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.700]   I would choose something more strategically.
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:14.380]   So let's go through some of these.
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:16.980]   The, again, very high levels of English proficiency,
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:19.340]   Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland,
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:20.780]   Singapore, and Luxembourg.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:23.020]   Very high levels of English proficiency.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:26.700]   So not a really pressing need to learn the local language.
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.900]   What about high levels of English proficiency?
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:32.120]   Austria, Germany, Poland, Belgium, Malaysia, Philippines,
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.500]   Switzerland, Portugal, Czech Republic, Serbia,
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.840]   Hungary, Argentina, and Romania.
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.780]   Moderate levels, Slovakia, India, Dominican Republic,
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:44.100]   Bulgaria, Spain, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.940]   South Korea, Italy, France, Hong Kong,
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.140]   Vietnam, Indonesia, and Taiwan.
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.800]   So we're in that moderate range.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.740]   This for me has been a language like Hindi.
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:57.740]   I'm super interested in the potential for India as a nation.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:00.660]   I think it's one of the met world's economies
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:03.960]   is gonna make a huge difference in the coming decades.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.220]   I haven't been to India yet, I'd like to go.
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.900]   I don't have any clue about how to crack the Indian culture
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.660]   and where the opportunities are.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.100]   But one of the reasons why I've often
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.140]   not been particularly interested in learning Hindi
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.340]   has simply been that there are huge,
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:20.340]   huge widespread levels of English speaking.
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.660]   English being an official language of India,
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.220]   it's just seemed like,
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.660]   oh, it's very hard, harder for me to learn Hindi,
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:30.260]   but I could probably get along well in English.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:32.660]   So that's been a reason why even though Hindi
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:35.380]   is widely spoken from a numeric factor,
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.380]   I've never been particularly interested in it
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.340]   as a foreign language for me to learn.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:43.460]   I think the natural counter argument to that, however,
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:47.620]   would be the use of a foreign language
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:50.160]   to establish more of a cultural connection.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.400]   So if I were working in an industry
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:57.260]   with a lot of Indian employees,
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:00.360]   then I think I would try to learn at least some basic Hindi
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:04.620]   so that I could demonstrate an appreciation of the language
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:08.160]   and smooth out my relationships with my coworkers,
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.120]   superiors, employees that I'm managing,
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:16.720]   just to have that bring the cultural barriers
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.600]   between the Indian culture and maybe the American culture,
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.120]   the Canadian culture, to bring that down.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.800]   Low levels of proficiency in English,
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.400]   Russia, Japan, Uruguay, Macau, Costa Rica,
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.800]   China, Brazil, Ukraine, Chile, Mexico,
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.360]   Morocco, Peru, the UAE, Ecuador, Pakistan,
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.840]   and then very low levels of proficiency in English,
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.720]   Colombia, Panama, Turkey, Tunisia, Guatemala,
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.760]   Kazakhstan, Egypt, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Sri Lanka,
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.800]   Qatar, Venezuela, Iran, Jordan, El Salvador, Oman, Kuwait,
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.160]   Mongolia, Algeria, Saudi Arabia,
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:53.000]   Cambodia, Laos, Libya, Iraq, et cetera.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.200]   So you can consider that
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:00.560]   and consider what other factors there are for you.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.280]   So from this analysis for the British Council,
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.880]   the 10 most important languages,
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.320]   Spanish, Mandarin, French, Arabic, German, Italian,
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.920]   Dutch, Portuguese, Japanese, and Russian.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:18.520]   I will close this out with two quotes
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.960]   from this particular report that I'm referencing,
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.800]   and I will link the report in the show notes
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.680]   that you can download the PDF and read it yourself
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.400]   if you're interested in this.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.640]   But from the introduction,
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.320]   the authors of the report write this.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:34.120]   They say, "As the UK embarks on a new era
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.080]   of cooperation with Europe and with the rest of the world,
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.520]   the extent to which the country can realize the vision
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.480]   of a truly global UK in the long-term
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.320]   will depend on our ability to succeed
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:46.400]   in a competitive international environment
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.600]   and to understand and connect with people across the world."
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.960]   I took that quote, and I just marked out the UK,
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.200]   and I put it in for Joshua, right?
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:59.040]   As Joshua embarks, you of course insert your own name,
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.400]   but as Joshua embarks on a new era
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.120]   of cooperation with the world,
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.480]   the extent to which Joshua can realize his vision
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.720]   of a truly global lifestyle in the long-term
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.040]   will depend on his ability to succeed
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.720]   in a competitive international environment
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.640]   and to understand and connect with people across the world.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.840]   And one way to do that,
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.440]   I'll read directly from the report,
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.520]   "The ability to function in more than one language
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.040]   is increasingly being seen
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.080]   not just as enabling a basic transaction,
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.240]   but as a crucial component of a set of skills,
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:31.360]   attributes, and knowledge
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.040]   required for success in the world today."
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.120]   One other quote that came from a business leader
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:40.360]   in the report, sorry, from the finance editor,
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.840]   Liana Brindid, the finance editor and the business insider,
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.560]   who said this, "Speaking German will not only get you,
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.840]   in general, the highest paid job,
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.360]   it is also the language that is in highest demand
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.840]   across job postings."
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.440]   Now, I think that if we were dealing with people
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.920]   who were not speaking English,
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.040]   then English would replace that.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.440]   Perhaps there's a region or a country in which it wouldn't,
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:09.080]   but I think globally speaking for non-English speakers,
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.640]   speaking English will get you, in general,
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.520]   the highest paid job, and it is the language
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.360]   that is in the highest demand across job postings.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.280]   But if you are an English speaker,
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.240]   you wanna think about that.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.920]   What is the language that is in the highest demand?
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.160]   What is the language that will get me the highest paid job?
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.360]   And what is the language that is in the highest demand
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.880]   across job postings?
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.200]   It's hard work to learn a language.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.880]   Maybe enjoyable, may not be.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.360]   Some people like it, some people don't.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.840]   I think a lot of times,
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:38.840]   the reasons people don't like languages
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.960]   is simply bad methodology, right?
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.000]   They're sitting in a class being drilled
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.440]   on grammar exercises, which stink.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:47.760]   But if you can get a great story, get a great novel,
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.120]   figure out what you're into,
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.520]   and learn how to read that in the language,
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.400]   it can be super fun and really enjoyable.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.160]   I enjoy my foreign language study.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:02.200]   Right now, I've only studied and am studying languages
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.280]   that I have a natural connection to the alphabet of.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.200]   My next language next year is going to be Mandarin Chinese.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.080]   That's gonna be a lot of slog work at the beginning
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.880]   as I learn to read Chinese characters.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.080]   That's gonna be a huge level of just work.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.800]   But then once I break through
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.720]   with the knowledge of the characters,
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.880]   it's gonna start to be fun again
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.480]   because I'll find literature and material
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.080]   that I really enjoy and that I'm really interested in.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.960]   And that's the secret to making it fun.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.080]   So I think a lot of people who think language learning
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.600]   is not interesting or not fun,
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.320]   probably maybe they're studying the wrong language
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.320]   for the wrong reasons, or they have bad tools,
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.200]   or bad philosophy, et cetera.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.840]   If you're not into it, you're not into it.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.360]   Go develop yourself some other way.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.360]   But if you are into it, or at least you're open to it,
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.520]   recognize that proficiency in languages,
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.880]   another language, a set of languages,
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.640]   could possibly make you very attractive in the job market.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.800]   Minimize your personal unemployment rate,
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.440]   which is incredibly important,
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.720]   and possibly open up to you
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.720]   some of the most interesting jobs you could imagine.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:11.640]   Again, I don't plan to do it at this point in time
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.120]   'cause at this point in time,
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.880]   the travel needed is not on my priority list.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.840]   But one of my dream jobs was
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.640]   that international mutual fund research analyst
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.640]   or something like that.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.800]   Love business, like investing.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:30.160]   And so you tell Joshua that he gets to go to Sri Lanka
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.080]   and interview the management staff of a local company,
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:33.920]   man, I'm in.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.640]   I think that sounds awesome.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.080]   And languages are a useful component of that.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.520]   Hope you've enjoyed this part two of the series.
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:46.000]   In closing, I would pitch to you my course
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.040]   on career and income planning.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:53.040]   If you're looking strategically at your finances
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.120]   and you're trying to figure out
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.160]   where do I focus my efforts on the most productive things,
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.840]   it's got to be your income.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.560]   And you wanna do two things.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:05.500]   You wanna make sure that you love your work,
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:06.760]   that you love your job.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:07.960]   To the extent possible,
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:11.400]   you wanna make sure that you tap dance into work every day,
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.860]   so famously, pithily described by Warren Buffett, right?
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:17.520]   You wanna make sure it's fun, that you enjoy it.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.720]   And you can do that.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:23.440]   There are so many opportunities for diverse kinds of jobs
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.080]   and work available today
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.880]   that it's one of the best times in the world.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:29.160]   It's the best time in human history
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:33.200]   because of just the simple, interesting work you can do.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.580]   It's so cool.
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:36.680]   And so you wanna do work that's interesting to you
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.640]   because if it's work that you care about,
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.680]   that's interesting to you, that you love,
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.880]   that you believe matters,
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.800]   then the pay almost doesn't matter.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.040]   And then number two is you wanna work in an area
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.600]   where you can be paid very, very well.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.920]   You can be paid very, very well.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.360]   And if you'll develop jobs,
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:58.280]   work that you can be paid very, very well for,
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.540]   then you become very, very wealthy very quickly.
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:03.040]   You can live a very high lifestyle.
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.800]   And so if you're sitting in a place
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.720]   where you're sitting around and you're unemployed,
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.560]   I would urge you, take the time,
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.960]   take your chance that you have right now
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.240]   to, you're unemployed,
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:19.040]   and spend your time investing into interesting work,
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:22.600]   developing yourself to be qualified for interesting work.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.240]   Maybe you're sitting in the United States
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.840]   and you're in Atlanta, Georgia,
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.680]   and you're looking around and you're like,
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:28.160]   my city's on fire.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.920]   And I'm not into this.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:34.920]   Well, why don't you make a plan to move to Paris, right?
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.060]   Or move to London or move to,
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:41.140]   Brazil's hard right now 'cause of coronavirus,
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:44.760]   but move to, the whole world is, move to Tokyo, right?
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.600]   Maybe that's your thing.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.720]   Or move to Singapore or wherever you're interested in,
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.460]   whatever region of the world you, Vanuatu, I don't know.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:52.880]   Something that you think would be really awesome.
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.120]   And your dream might be to move to Vanuatu
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.040]   and open a surf shop.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.600]   My dream would be more akin to move to Singapore
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.080]   and become an international banker
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.800]   or become a business consultant, but you can do it.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.800]   You can do it.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.480]   And if you've got something that would be interesting to you
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.560]   and you can trade out working in an office building
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.080]   in Atlanta, Georgia,
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:13.520]   and trade up for being a business consultant
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:18.520]   across Europe, across Western Europe, go for it.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.600]   And so if you need to get a degree, get busy.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.360]   If you need to apply for a job
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.040]   and you need to learn French or German, do it.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.160]   In three months, you can be at conversational level
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.720]   in some of these languages that are accessible.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.240]   In six months, you can be at pretty decent
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:37.160]   in a year of hard study, especially if you've got time.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:42.160]   In a year of hard study, you could be very, very conversant
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.120]   in any of these languages.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.160]   Not promising, you know,
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.080]   fluency is a hard concept to nail down,
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.560]   but the point is it's available to you.
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:53.360]   So if you look around you and the life that you're living
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:56.160]   isn't motivating and exciting,
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.760]   then think about what would be.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.080]   And if you're interested in some input,
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:02.000]   some advice on how to do that, how to position yourself,
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.960]   how to think through that analysis
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:07.100]   and how to market yourself into a new career or a new job,
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.600]   go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store

[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.820]   It's the decision, choosing the right career
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:19.600]   is the single most important factor for you
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:22.520]   in terms of the enjoyment of your work life
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.320]   and in the amount of money that you earn
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.320]   and how wealthy you ultimately become.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.760]   So go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store
