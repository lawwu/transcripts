[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   We received an email from an anonymous man who writes, "Pastor John, I thank you
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.360]   for your ministry. I'm a regenerate Christian who formerly lived the
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.400]   homosexual lifestyle. God used your theology of suffering and brokenness to
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.160]   overcome my sexual desires for ungodly things, but now a new struggle has come
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.000]   upon me, the struggle of laziness. Do you have any advice on how to fight this?"
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.640]   Yeah, it might sound strange, but the first thing I would do is open the hood
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.840]   and check the engine. And what I mean by that is, does he have a thyroid problem?
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.280]   Is he sleep deprived? Is he eating right? I mean, really, a lot of things in the
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.320]   Christian life that are perceived as spiritual shortcomings are in fact
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.400]   physically related. I was so weary about ten years ago, and I couldn't explain why.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.760]   I went to the doctor and he said, "Well, you know, I don't think there's any
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.480]   problem, but let's check your thyroid." Man, within 12 hours, I think it was early
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.960]   the next morning, he calls me back. He said, "You are profoundly hypothyroid. I
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.440]   don't know how you're functioning," he said. And so he stuck me on this
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.120]   Synthroid medicine, and things have been different. Now, if I had tried to
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.400]   spiritualize that, I would have missed it entirely. That here's a
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.560]   thyroid, my thyroid is dead, and there's no amount of reading my Bible that was
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.240]   going to change that. So that's the first thing I do. But he's really not asking.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.040]   He's asking, "I think I've got a sin issue. Can you help me with it?" And my
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.640]   approach to that would be, number one, I would start at the beginning of
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.880]   the Bible and say, "First of all, get a good theology of work. Work is not a
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.960]   curse. Frustrating work is a curse. The Lord God put the man in the Garden of
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.760]   Eden to work it and keep it, and that's before the fall. So get a robust, good,
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:14.640]   positive theology of work. Realize that God put us on the planet to be
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.680]   makers, co-creators, co-workers with Him. We are His workmanship, created in Christ
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.680]   Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand. Whatever your hand finds to
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.040]   do, do it with all your might. Do it as to the Lord and not to man. So all those
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.520]   verses are meant to just feed into a robust theology of looking upon doing
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.880]   during the day, getting up, being productive, making something happen,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.240]   creating something, cleaning a room, washing the car, fixing the brakes,
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.400]   writing a computer program, tending a sick person, making a good meal. All these
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.880]   things are blessed by God as something He wants His co-makers and co-workers to
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.920]   do. And after I got a good, robust theology built in of work, I think I'd
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.880]   point him to some warnings about being a slacker. You know, if anyone is not
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.240]   willing to work, let him not eat, Paul said in 2 Thessalonians 3. And then
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:28.760]   maybe the last thing I would say, you know, working hard is availing yourself
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.000]   of the grace of God in you. And I'd point him to one of my favorite verses, 1
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.880]   Corinthians 15.10, "By the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.680]   not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them." In other words,
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.440]   grace produced work in me, though it was not I but the grace of God that is with
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:03.680]   me. So I'd try to help him discover how to apply your will to a task in hard
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.440]   work in such a way that as you do it and after you do it, you are sensing and then
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.240]   knowing, "God is at work in me." Work out your salvation for, "God is at work in me."
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:24.040]   This is what I think gives the work life its greatest meaning. So that'd be
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.640]   my approach, and you know, we go one by one and try to discern what's the real
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.160]   need of the person, but those would be the biblical principles that I would
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.120]   dig into with him. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this
