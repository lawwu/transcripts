[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   - Tara from Denton, Texas writes in to ask,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.060]   you said that C.S. Lewis is in your top five of people
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.200]   who have influenced you the most.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.520]   Who are the others in your top five?
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.480]   - I wondered if that question might come back.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.680]   (laughing)
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.000]   When I said five, I didn't even think about five
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.320]   when I said it, but so--
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.280]   - Okay, so let's just be clear here before we go on.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.780]   You just threw out the top five as a general parameter,
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.200]   not because you had it all figured out.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.540]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.740]   I would not put him at the top.
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.700]   I'll see if I can fit him in, okay?
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.700]   (laughing)
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.940]   Right at the top, I'm gonna put Bill and Ruth Piper.
[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.540]   - Yes, absolutely. - Okay, mom and dad.
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.540]   Because of tens of thousands of influences
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.660]   that are incalculable and unremembered
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.700]   by little boy John Piper, right?
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.460]   I mean, who of us could begin to estimate
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.200]   the impact of Christian parents on us
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.740]   even if we can't remember
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.400]   decisive theological turning points?
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.920]   So I'm gonna rank my parents right at the top,
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.520]   give them the honor that I think they're due,
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.980]   and they're way, way above C.S. Lewis
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.240]   in shaping me, I am sure.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.240]   Secondly, Daniel Fuller, my teacher in seminary,
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.240]   introduced me to a way of reading the Bible called arcing,
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.240]   and he introduced me to a great, glorious God
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.380]   whose pursuit of his glory
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.440]   is the overarching way the Bible is unified.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.080]   He introduced me to a great God of glory
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.960]   whose pursuit of his own glory,
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.040]   whose commitment to his own glory
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.200]   is the unifying principle of the Bible.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.580]   So those two things, a way of reading the Bible
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.440]   that has borne fruit to this day now, 40 years later,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.840]   and a vision of a sovereign God unifying the Bible
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.240]   through his pursuit of his own glory.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.800]   So Daniel Fuller is right up there in number two or three.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.200]   Right under him comes Jonathan Edwards,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.960]   whose book "Freedom of the Will"
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.160]   locked me down as a Calvinist
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.160]   and whose hand touches everything and inflames it.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.660]   I mean, I just go to any part of Edwards just about
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.500]   and start reading and things get on fire.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.300]   I just don't know why he does that for me, but he does.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.980]   He was alive to the glories of Christ,
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.900]   and so he's just unfathomably rich
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.500]   in the way he handles divine things.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.660]   And probably right there is where C.S. Lewis
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.540]   is gonna fit in, and right under him
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.940]   is gonna come probably John Owen
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.480]   with the death of death on particular redemption
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.000]   and the mortification of sin in confirming in a rich way
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.040]   my understanding of future grace.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.560]   And I'm gonna throw in one more, a surprising one.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.880]   E.D. Hirsch wrote a book called
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.880]   "Validity and Interpretation" in 1967,
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.000]   and the point of the book is simply this.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.480]   There is such a thing as valid interpretation,
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.920]   interpretation that's right or wrong,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.060]   and the criterion of that validity
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.760]   is the author's intention, and that's what you should pursue.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.520]   I mean, that is so simple.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.760]   I mean, it seems to me like it's the most obvious
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.240]   common sense thing in the world
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.960]   that if I write a love letter to Noelle,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.640]   I don't want her making up meaning, right?
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.760]   I want her to see my heart, know my heart,
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.040]   know my intention, and therefore,
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.760]   that's the way we should read the Bible as well.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.220]   - All right, so you give us four authors.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.160]   I mean, let's say we talk about specific books
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.320]   and authors that we can read according to your list here.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.600]   So it would be Edwards, Lewis, Owen, Hirsch.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.800]   Then who would be number five if you have a free slot now?
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   - I think I should probably throw into that mix
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.920]   a contemporary author, and the top three,
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.680]   I'm gonna put J.I. Packer, R.C. Sproul, Sinclair Ferguson.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.680]   In other words, these men are latter-day Puritans,
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.820]   and what made the Puritans so rich
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.980]   is that they were utterly saturated with the Bible.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.440]   They had a huge God.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.280]   They pushed that God with that Bible
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.700]   into all the areas of life,
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.700]   and so every time I have picked up those guys and read them,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.540]   my heart has been warmed, my mind has been made sharper,
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.620]   so that's where I'd send people.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.660]   - Excellent, that's fantastic.
