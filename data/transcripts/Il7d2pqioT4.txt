[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   Let's go to Psalm 75.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:16.360]   Psalm 75 begins by saying, "For the choir director, Al-Tashayth, a psalm of Asaph, a
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.680]   song.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.360]   We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks, for your name is near.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.520]   Men recount your wondrous deeds.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.880]   For I select an appointed time, it is I who judge with equity.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.920]   The earth and all who dwell in it melt, it is I who have firmly set its pillars.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.920]   Selah.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.440]   I said to the boastful, do not boast, and to the wicked, do not raise up the horn.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.120]   Do not raise up your horn on high, nor speak with insolent pride.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.320]   For one's rising up does not come from the east nor from the west, and not from the desert,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.080]   but God is the judge.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.520]   He puts down one and raises up another.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.560]   For a cup is in the hand of Yahweh, and the wine foams.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.120]   It is full of his mixture, and he pours from this.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.120]   Surely all the wicked of the earth must drain and drink down its dregs.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.260]   But as for me, I will declare it forever.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.160]   I will sing praises to the God of Jacob, and all the horns of the wicked I will cut off.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.560]   But the horns of the righteous will be raised up.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.560]   "
