[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   All right, final segment, the five books I read in February 2023.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.800]   As long time listeners know, I try to read five books a month and I report on what those
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.920]   books are here on the podcast.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.120]   All right, so what did I read in February?
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.680]   Number one, The Clockwork Universe by Edward Dolnick.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.440]   This was roughly speaking a popular history of the Royal Society in London.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:36.560]   More generally speaking, it was a book about the rise of the Enlightenment scientific mindset.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.580]   Dolnick makes this point, but a lot of other authors make this point as well.
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.680]   Isaac Newton was at a turning point.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.000]   Isaac Newton was born and came up in a world that was connected more to Greek thought and
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.040]   mythological thought.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.880]   And by the time he died, we were in a world that had a more empirical mathematical approach
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.680]   to understanding the world.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.920]   I love these type of histories.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.160]   It's a very readable book, short chapters, it moves pretty quick.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.000]   Not as deep as some other histories I've read on this, but had a lot of good information.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.040]   So a lot of London in this episode.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.040]   Two questions from London.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.160]   Two questions from London, a book about London.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.160]   You know why?
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.640]   It's because I am, that article we talked about last week in the Financial Times, obviously
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.400]   that's a London based publication.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.160]   So like last week I was killing it in the UK.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:31.760]   This podcast, number one technology podcast in the UK, like number 30 overall podcast
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.160]   in the UK.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.600]   Deep Work at Amazon UK was ranked like 60.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   That's so good.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   Right?
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.600]   So we've been killing it in the UK.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.680]   So as you can see, we're pushing all of our content to be UK centric.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.720]   There's a lot of good golf courses around London.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.720]   That's true.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.840]   We need a podcast out of there.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.840]   All right.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.560]   I also read Wandering Home by Bill McKibben.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.040]   I read that years and years ago, but I had a copy of my library.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.200]   So I went back and read it and loved it.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   Very nostalgic.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.640]   I really remember reading that book in grad school.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.120]   Bill McKibben, who I really like, I interviewed him for a New Yorker piece a couple of years
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.120]   ago.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:14.000]   He wrote this cool book where he walked from his house in Ripton, Vermont, which is sort
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.140]   of one Valley over from Lake Champlain in Western Vermont to his house in the Adirondacks.
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.640]   So the McKibben story is that he quit the New Yorker and moved to a cabin.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.720]   It was really like a rundown house.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.360]   Him and his wife, Susan Halperin, who's an excellent journalist, they moved to this house
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.640]   in the Adirondacks.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.360]   And then once they had their kid, they realized kids need a school to go to.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.080]   So they moved across Lake Champlain to Ripton, Vermont, which I actually visited there last
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.080]   summer.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.600]   It's one south of Lincoln.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.760]   It's these cool green mountain towns that are up at elevation and really quaint.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.840]   He walked from Ripton to the old house, the Adirondacks.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.160]   He had someone row him across Lake Champlain.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.320]   And in doing so, he visited all these places and talked a lot about the type of things
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.080]   he writes about in Deep Economy.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.240]   Sustainable commercial endeavor, etc.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.760]   It was a really cool book, really nostalgic.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.360]   Makes you want to just move to Vermont and drink Otter Creek beer and hang out at Middlebury.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.520]   Another book I read, you'd appreciate this one, Jesse, America's Game by Michael McCambridge,
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.920]   the history of the NFL.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.920]   The long book.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.340]   I read it for, I'm in a dad book group that only reads sports books.
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.520]   It's a lot of like journalists and stuff that we just don't want to read anything that's
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.720]   too close to our work.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.520]   Everything is too close to home, so we read sports books.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.600]   I like that.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.280]   I know a lot about the history of the NFL now, at least up until 2005, when this book
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.280]   came out.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.760]   In the early days, like back during Lombardi, the Canadian Football League was a big, it
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.060]   was definitely competitive.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.720]   People would go over there and-
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.280]   Not mentioned at all in this book.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   Really?
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   That's an interesting oversight.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.000]   Matt Dogg had his historian on earlier in the week and they were actually talking about
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.520]   that because somebody died.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.200]   Michael McCambridge, man, you missed the big storyline here.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.400]   I also read The Conquest of Happiness by Bertrand Russell.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.360]   The philosopher, mathematician Bertrand Russell wrote this book.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.760]   This would have been in like 19, I think it's like 1919 or something like that, maybe 1930,
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.840]   somewhere in that period, maybe a little later than that.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   I might be messing it up.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.880]   I mean, he died in the, he died remarkably late.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.720]   He lived a long time.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   I'm going to say the 1930s.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.680]   Anyways, there's a really nice new edition of this book that I found at Barnes and Noble.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.240]   And so I was like, okay, I got to read this.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.960]   It's like a kind of like a self-help book, but written before people wrote self-help
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.200]   books and written by an eminent philosopher and mathematician.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.320]   And it's him trying to deconstruct and understand the sources of human happiness, as well as
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.920]   the things that pull away from human happiness and trying to lay out some sort of program
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.760]   for how you can maximize it in your life.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.480]   This is what philosophers used to do.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.280]   This is why I really dislike this tendency we have for, especially the very online types
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.680]   to be very dismissive about, well, their self-help.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.280]   They're a guru where you have to like throw this disclaimer at the front of everything
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   you write.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.280]   We're like, ah, I'm no guru.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   I'm not.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280]   In fact, I'm, I'm terrible.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.960]   And, and I'm, I'm, I can barely walk and I'm not giving any advice.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.200]   And you really think people are going to applaud, like there's all these gurus who are, you
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.280]   know, preying on people.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.360]   But look, it used to be professional thinkers and philosophers were like, this is one of
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.680]   the things I want to do is try to think through big questions from life and take my swing.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.180]   So good for Russell for doing it.
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.400]   Very readable.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.120]   There's some anachronisms in it, but actually otherwise reads as a pretty modern book.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.400]   A lot of similar concepts to the deep life stuff that you talk about.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   There's some, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.920]   I mean, I get like getting outside and just that stuff, but also a lot of psychological
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.520]   stuff like jealousy and pride and trying to understand.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.520]   It's interesting.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.360]   And so it's kind of mental healthy, a lot of it, the habits of mind that can really
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.360]   pull you down.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.040]   I mean, it actually reads pretty relevant, but it is an issue of mine.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.440]   Is this like, I'm not impressed by people who have to put these long disclaimers about
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.240]   like, I'm not a guru.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.120]   Who's going to tell you exactly how to live your life.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.520]   I mean, where are these gurus who are trying to tell people exactly how to live their life?
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.880]   I think smart people should take swings at here's a big question.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.440]   Let me take a swing at like how you might answer it.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.760]   People are smart.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.920]   They will adapt it to their own circumstances.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:49.440]   They will discount the obvious caveats, you know, this weird whatever it is, negative
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.880]   reaction that sort of very online elite types have to trying to be instructive or like to
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.000]   tackle big questions.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.680]   I don't think it's I don't think it's healthy.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.680]   It's similar in sports.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.280]   How they always say, oh, the naysayers say, yeah, X, Y, Z.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.960]   I think in online culture, it's very safe to be a naysayer because you'd be applauded
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.440]   for your world weary critiques.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.200]   People are like, oh, that's a good, I didn't see that angle of critique and there's no
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   real risk.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.680]   Yeah, being a little bit too critical.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.120]   I like, well, you know, sophisticated people are critical, but you're really opening yourself
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.120]   up.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.000]   If you say, this is my thoughts about this or like, this is my philosophy for how you
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   should do something.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.520]   I mean, I think it's, you know, it's why I've sold a lot of books is because I'm not online.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.520]   So I don't care.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   It's like, look, I think this is interesting.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.760]   I loved reading this stuff.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.400]   I love books like Bertrand Russell's Conquest of Happiness.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.840]   Like let's just get after it.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.360]   And I don't care.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.920]   So I guess more books for me if everyone else is afraid of it.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.360]   A lot of smart people who could be writing really interesting, cool, reflective books
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.240]   aren't because they don't want to get yelled at on Twitter.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.120]   So hey, more books for us.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.760]   Final book I read part of us kind of a holdover from Thriller December Rising Sun by Michael
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.760]   Crichton.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.480]   I'm sure I read that at some point when I was a kid, but I found the paperback in a
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.480]   newspaper back.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.200]   And so I read it well constructed sort of murder mystery thriller.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   It's two detectives.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:16.040]   They made a movie about this with Sean Connery and God, who was the other person?
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   Was it Wesley Snipes?
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040]   I think it was.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.320]   I saw that movie like 30 years ago.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.320]   I have to go back and watch the movie.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.760]   I mean, essentially there it's, it's a detective thriller, right?
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.000]   These are detectives and they're trying to figure out a murder.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.280]   And then there's some like Crichton high tech stuff.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.640]   The thing I, I didn't really realize this about Crichton until more recently.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.200]   He got really reactionary.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.040]   This was like a pretty like reactionary kind of anti-Japanese book.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.040]   Oh, really?
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.800]   Like, he was very worried, clearly very worried about the economic influence of at the then,
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.120]   I guess, Japan had this massive like outsized economic influence.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.960]   Not very nice to Japanese people.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   I'm thinking about disclosure.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.520]   I'm thinking about state of fear.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.920]   I was like, Oh, he kind of became curmudgeonly his nineties.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.680]   So it's, it's, it is pretty reactionary.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.600]   He just works this stuff into his book, but but still a good murder, good murder mystery.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.560]   But it's interesting layer.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.320]   Any of these books, audio?
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.280]   I'm sure they're all, no, none of these were audio.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   So you read them all?

[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:22.780]   I read a lot of audio books recently.
