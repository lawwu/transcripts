[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Most people have probably heard the hypothetical question, what would you do if you knew you
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.440]   couldn't fail?
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.640]   What would you do if you couldn't fail?
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.760]   And Seth turns that around.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.760]   I think that's a good question.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.520]   But he turns around and said, what would you do if you knew you were going to fail?
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.240]   In terms of identifying what you would do for the process, what would you do if you
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.240]   knew it was going to fail?
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.960]   Okay, you're considering these five different projects.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.160]   Let's say they're all going to fail, but you still have to choose one of the five.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.160]   Which would you choose?
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.240]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.160]   Much harder to answer.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.400]   And at the same time, I'm called back to when I was a graduate student and still now with
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:51.640]   the podcast, I have this litmus test, which is, is the experiment that I'm working on
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.760]   the one that I want to be working on most?
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.320]   Is the podcast that I'm working on the one that I want to be working on most?
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.520]   I mean, there's truly no other podcast I'd rather be having today than this one.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.160]   And the moment I'm starting to think, oh, I wish I was doing that thing over there,
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.040]   I realize I'm off target.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.040]   I'm off target.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.680]   And I think that asking really good questions is something clearly that you're very good
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.680]   at.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.560]   And getting a little bit deeper into your process around that, do you write those things
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.560]   down?
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.080]   Like, is there a notebook someplace in the kingdom of Tim Ferriss in Austin or elsewhere
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.760]   that says, you know, those questions that, that essentially those questions are written?
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.760]   Are they?
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.120]   I collect, I literally have a document with questions that I've gathered from Seth printed
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.400]   out and at the Airbnb where I'm staying here.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.640]   You brought it with you.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.320]   I printed it out here and then I went through and I read it last night and I was highlighting
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.400]   questions from past interviews I've had with him on my podcast to revisit his questions.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.400]   So I was literally doing that last night over dinner and I collect questions.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.960]   I collect questions.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.200]   If I am reading a magazine and I come across a good question, I take, I take a photo or
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.520]   I capture it somehow in notes or in Evernote, which I know is kind of old fashioned these
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.960]   days, but I've used it for everything.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.120]   So the critical mass is beyond enormous and I do collect and revisit these things.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.520]   I capture them in journals as well, but I absolutely capture good questions when I find
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.960]   them.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.440]   Questions are so powerful for the brain.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.080]   I don't want to go into this in too much detail cause I have a lot more questions for you,
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.840]   but we just wrapped a series on mental health that will come out later this year with Paul
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.560]   Conti and he is brilliant as we both know and does truly important work.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.360]   And he pointed to the value of asking really good questions about oneself and because of
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.440]   the way that questions that are really directed at self inquiry queue up the subconscious.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.400]   So you ask the question and unlike a statement or a meme, the brain works with that in the
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.320]   days and hours after asking the question in ways that simple declarative statements probably
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.280]   don't ping the system the same way, which is probably why we can see so many points
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.500]   of wisdom and truth everywhere and it doesn't necessarily transform us, but asking really
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.480]   good questions really does seem to transform us.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:25.000]   Yeah, there's, I think judging people by their questions is also a shortcut to assessing
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.840]   and learning a lot about how someone functions and what makes them tick.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.720]   I think it was Voltaire who said, you know, judge a man by his questions, not by his answers.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.960]   Something along those lines.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.440]   But when in doubt, attribute to Voltaire.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   It sounds good.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   It does sound good.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.040]   And I think about this a lot.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.480]   I do think about the questions and I refine the questions that I ask myself, especially
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.640]   while journaling because it's easier to cross examine and stress test your own certainty
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:00.920]   and beliefs when they are captured on paper or digitally on a laptop, for instance.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.760]   So I do routinely revisit certain questions that I've found helpful over time.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.320]   I mean, one that people can play with is with whatever is really causing you consternation
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.360]   or stress at the moment, some kind of decision or relationship, business, could be anything.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.080]   Just what might this look like if it were easy?
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.960]   What might this look like if it were easy, if it had to be easy, if that were possible,
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.720]   what might it look like?
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   And that could apply to anything.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.240]   It could apply to anything, you know, could apply to could apply to fitness.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.760]   It's like, look, if you do really intense kettlebell swings twice a week with proper
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.760]   weight and load and time under tension, and you do pushups a few times a week and handle
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.640]   a couple of other elements, you can get in pretty good shape.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.200]   It's so simple, but it hits a lot.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.840]   I mean, it hits your entire posterior chain.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.840]   Okay, fine.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.880]   Do some pushups and some core work, but if you're not exercising at all because you've
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.000]   made the assumption that it's four hours, five hours a week, rather than completely
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.400]   remove that objective and call it just impractical, can you ratchet down the scale?
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.600]   How far can you ratchet down the scale until you have no excuses?
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:29.440]   That would just be one example, language learning, tech investing, it applies to everything.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.560]   Making life easier is something that definitely gets my vote.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.560]   Making it easier and making it more elegant, right?
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.240]   The more pieces in your life you have floating around, the more contacts, the more extraneous
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.320]   loose connections, the harder your life is going to be.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.680]   The cognitive overload or overhead is really high.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.360]   So I'm always looking for maybe like Japanese flower arranger.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.780]   It's like, okay, how many pieces can I remove while still like maintaining the essence of
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.080]   what I'm trying to achieve?
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.200]   You and Rick Rubin, man, I'm telling you, two people I am fortunate enough to know personally
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.760]   and that I have tremendous respect for and the work is self-evident.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.960]   It's really remarkable.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.760]   So rewind that and listen to that segment right there, folks.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.680]   I'm telling you, I've worked hard to apply it because it's not my default and boy, does
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:31.280]   it make a significant improvement to simplify, simplify, simplify.
