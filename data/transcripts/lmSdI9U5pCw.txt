[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   The problem with online and text is people try to bundle everything into one communication.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.840]   The best analogy I can think of is if you were playing chess by text, would you put
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.960]   seven moves in your text?
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.600]   No, you'd only put one move in.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.400]   So only try to get one point across in a text.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.600]   Don't explain, don't throw a whole bunch of stuff in, text or emails.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.080]   They're all almost always too long, and it's going to come off as cold.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.080]   So do what you can to soften, soften it.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.480]   There's a documentary film that's been done on my company called Tactical Empathy.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.760]   Nick Nanton won 22, 23 Emmys.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.540]   The filmmaker DNA Films, it was finished last year, it's not out yet.
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.800]   For a variety of reasons, we haven't put it out.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.140]   So we screened the thing in Vegas last year.
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.240]   I see it, I love it.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.360]   I'm not a good judge of a film about me, I'm going to love it no matter what, it's about
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.360]   me.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.220]   But I tell Nick that night, oh man, I love it, this is great.
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.040]   Two days later, I find out, I realize there's a huge problem.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.720]   I've already told him it's okay.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.340]   So I got to get him, I'm going to text him, and then I'm going to call him, and we got
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.340]   to fix it now.
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:34.140]   Sunday, text message, I sent him a two line text, it's now bad time to talk, I got something
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.280]   you don't want to hear.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.280]   Two lines.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.340]   Now, what were my other options?
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.760]   I could have called him, Nick and I got a great relationship.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.480]   I call him, if he's in a position to pick up the phone, doesn't matter what he's doing,
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.060]   he's going to answer the phone.
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.660]   He was in the middle of a Zoom call.
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.160]   If I'd have called, he'd have picked up during the Zoom call, and both conversations would
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.740]   have been bad.
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.520]   He immediately fires back to me, I'm in the middle of a Zoom call, I'll call you in half
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.080]   an hour.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.900]   He already knows he ain't going to like what he's going to hear.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.360]   I'm prepping him for bad news.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.740]   Get him on the phone, like look, I know what I said, we got a problem, we got to get Derek
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.740]   on camera.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.780]   Derek is a guy in my team, and I'm shocked that I haven't made him part of the documentary.
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.260]   This is going to be incomplete without Derek.
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.420]   We got to get Derek on film, we can't show this to anybody else until we get him on film
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.420]   and make a part of it.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.740]   Immediately, he's in problem solving mode.
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.260]   He goes, okay, I got to get a crew to Derek or get Derek to a crew.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.140]   I need to know when we can do that.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.140]   We got another showing of the films scheduled in LA, less than a month away.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.740]   He says, I got to get Derek on camera, and we got to edit it, it's going to take three
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.740]   weeks of editing.
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.380]   I said, I'll give you access to Derek's camera, he goes, done, or Derek's calendar.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.420]   He says, done, it's done.
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.660]   We go through this whole conversation in less than 10 minutes.
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.420]   Now think of the normal negotiation, hey, Nick, how are you?
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.380]   What's going on today?
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.380]   Are you in a good mood?
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.260]   Hey, hey, hey, how are the kids doing?
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.420]   All this time wasting conversation, if I had set him up with that normal, he could have
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.100]   legitimately said, are you out of your mind?
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.940]   We've been working on this for a year, you didn't bring this up in a year.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.260]   Not only that, you already told me two days ago at the showing in Vegas that you loved
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.260]   it.
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.540]   Now, a year, year and a half into this project, you're bringing up all these new problems.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.300]   That would have been the normal negotiation.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:46.260]   But since we got a highly collaborative relationship, two line text, we're done in 10 minutes.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.640]   Now, since Nick's a very generous guy, when he gets done, and he says, by the way, you
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.420]   understand how much this is going to cost me, it's just three weeks of editing.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.780]   This is three hours of shooting and three weeks of editing.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.780]   I go, yeah, he goes, but I'm happy to do it.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.020]   Calls him back the next day, he's got a favor to ask of me.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.020]   You got it.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.180]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.840]   Because we'd gone through what would have been a very complicated negotiation that started
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.300]   on text.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.940]   I sent him a two line text on a Sunday, and we got to solve that fast.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.660]   If I understand correctly, by setting the context in a very direct and succinct way,
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.060]   he goes into it in a problem solving mode with you.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.540]   Whereas if you do the tour of all the things that are going well in life, and the sort
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:45.260]   of the, we'll keep this PG, the mud sandwich approach.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.260]   They teach you that.
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.620]   When you get a laboratory, most scientists have no skill running a business.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.740]   You get a laboratory, all you've done is experiments, and then suddenly you're in charge of people
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.140]   managing budgets and all this stuff.
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.500]   Most scientists, 99% of scientists are completely unqualified to do the job they do at the level
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.500]   of running a laboratory.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.060]   When they start, you learn it on the job.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.300]   And eventually, you end up having to let somebody go.
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.940]   And so the typical thing they teach you in these online training things is you tell somebody
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.100]   something nice, then you give them the bad news, and then you tell them something nice
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.100]   on exit.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.500]   That's kind of the mud, so to speak, sandwich.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   This is not that.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.660]   What you're talking about is saying, hey, this is the problem.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.460]   You're not going to like the problem, or there is a problem, you're not going to like it,
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.540]   so that they show up with the context of solving a problem, as opposed to giving them the tour
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.740]   of all the things that are going well, and then the problem is really in contrast to
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.740]   that.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.700]   And then it's like, ugh.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.420]   So what I love about what you're describing is it's direct, it's honest.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:55.780]   You're not doing the tour of the garden before you take them down to the septic tank.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.940]   It's what I would call the difference between being blunt and being a straight shooter.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.420]   A straight shooter tells you the truth.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.180]   They just tell it in a way that lands softly.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
