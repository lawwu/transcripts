[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   Welcome to a new week on the podcast. Today's question comes from a listener named Caitlin.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.480]   "Pastor John, thank you for the podcast. I recently listened to Francis Chan's response
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.560]   to the question, 'Why are Christian singles marrying later?' I have been deeply impacted
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.600]   by the writings and the teachings of Francis Chan in the past and have profound respect
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.180]   for him. But his reasoning that singles in the church are engaging in sexual immorality
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.620]   and therefore marrying later felt dismissive for a lot of us. I cannot name a single Christian
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.000]   couple that is in the situation he describes and is therefore delaying marriage. His response
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.760]   felt like it skimmed over a topic with so much more depth to it. I know many godly unmarried
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.720]   Christian women in particular who desire marriage, yet there seem to be so few unmarried Christian
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.800]   men around interested in pursuing any of them. These women fight daily for purity and joy
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.120]   in the Lord. This is not a fight we take lightly. So to be told that the reason we are not married
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.840]   is because we are engaging in sex before marriage makes us feel profoundly misunderstood and
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.280]   swept to the side. I also happen to know that the majority of these women carry moderate
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.700]   to large loads of student loan debt that they are working diligently to pay off. This means
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.600]   the majority of our time is spent working long hours, often multiple jobs. As you can
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.640]   imagine, this leaves little time for socialization. This job situation is likely going to be a
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.520]   reality for many of us well into our 30s. I would love to hear your response, Pastor
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.800]   John, to this same question. What encouragement can you offer us single women who are pursuing
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.200]   the Lord with all of our hearts and functioning in this world as best as we can?
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:51.800]   First, I know Francis Chan, and I am sure if he were with me here at this microphone
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:03.920]   he would say that the reasons people are marrying later are indeed much more diverse and complex
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.440]   than the fact that lots of couples are substituting sex for marriage. So I'm starting with the
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.920]   assumption that Francis was emphasizing a particular factor rather than stating it as
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.440]   the only factor, even though I know because of the way people have taken my kinds of communication
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.400]   that it would be easy for Caitlin to feel the way she felt. So I'm going to start there.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:43.240]   The real question here, it seems to me, for Caitlin is not so much that we can figure
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:51.360]   out—we've got to figure out—why since 1970 the median age for women to get married
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:00.880]   has increased by four or five years to 25 plus, and for men a little less, increased
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:09.720]   up to 26.8, I read recently. There are lots of factors feeding that phenomenon, like twice
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.960]   as many women go to college today as 30 years ago, and careers are often a priority, and
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   fear of marriage commitments for both men and women because half of those young people
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.840]   have divorced parents and therefore are terrified that they don't want to do that, they don't
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.840]   want to do it the way their parents did it. Loss of community is a big one, I think, where
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.520]   finding a spouse isn't as natural and communal as it used to be and the way the world was
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:50.320]   once upon a time. Changes in expectation about what makes a good spouse, largely owing, I
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:57.040]   think, to entertainment and media. Delays in maturity for men and women. Good night.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.880]   Adolescence just gets longer and longer, so the whole books are being written on adultolescence.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:11.960]   It's a very complex setting, situation, cluster of factors that make things harder today,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:19.160]   just really harder for young people. But what Caitlin points out here, and I'm really
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.920]   happy to hear it, is that there are—I'm adding the word thousands, she said many,
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.440]   and I would agree totally that there are thousands, thousands of young women who, and men, I think,
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.400]   who would like to be married, who are not having sex before marriage. Believe it or
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.200]   not, there are people like that, lots of them, who have to work full time if for no other
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:51.640]   reason than to pay back student loans, which puts a good deal of pressure on her and their
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.680]   energy and time for being active and flexible in social relationships. So she asks, and
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.800]   this is the question that I assume she wants me to address, not all that, is what encouragement
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   can you offer us single women who are pursuing the Lord with all our hearts and functioning
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.080]   in this world the best we can? And I like that question because that's what the Bible
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.680]   is for. It is to help us where we are, not just say, "Wouldn't it be nice to be in
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.840]   another world?" My encouragement, Caitlin, is this—I'll put it just in a simple phrase
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:34.920]   and then I'll unpack it—God is sovereign over your life, and God is good. Now, if you
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:43.080]   are his child, and just like you say you are, pursuing the Lord with all your heart, we
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.720]   have it on God's authority that he will withhold from you no good thing, nothing that
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.840]   is good for you. Psalm 84 11, "The Lord God is a sun and shield. The Lord bestows
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:06.320]   favor and honor. No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly." So I'm
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.640]   going to suggest, with that promise as the background, that you linger over two stories
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:20.120]   in the Bible for your encouragement. One is the story of Ruth. Ruth. She resolved
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:27.440]   as a young widow to leave her homeland, Moab, and to be faithful to Naomi, her mother-in-law,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.000]   with these words, "Do not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.240]   you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:46.640]   and your God my God. Where you die, I will die, and there will I be buried. May the Lord
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:53.920]   do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts me from you." That's Ruth 1
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:02.440]   16-17. Now, that meant that as a Moabite woman in Israel, the prospects for marriage were
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:12.400]   zero. Apart from an extraordinary work of God, what godly Jew would marry a Moabite
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:20.080]   and a widow and all the other circumstances surrounding this? But God—I like that phrase—but
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:28.800]   God rewarded her faithfulness, faithfulness to God and to her human relations, with a
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:38.840]   total surprise. His name was Boaz. You cannot plan things like this. You can't. You can't
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.920]   strategize as a young woman, "I'm going to have a Boaz. I know what to do. I know
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.320]   what fields to go to. I know a country to go to." You can't. You can't strategize
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:56.600]   for this kind of matchmaking. You can only do your work with joy in the Lord and watch
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:04.100]   the sovereign God work for you. That's the first suggestion. Meditate. Linger over
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:10.840]   the book of Ruth. And lest you think, Caitlin, that I'm a hopeless romantic with only happily
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:19.040]   ever after marriage endings, my second suggestion is that you linger over the story of Anna
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:26.280]   in Luke 2 36 and 37. There was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:33.520]   of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years. So I'd
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:42.040]   guess maybe from age 17 to 24, from when she was a virgin and then as a widow until she
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:51.780]   was 84. That'd be 60 years. She did not depart from the temple, worshipping with fasting
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:09:00.280]   and prayer night and day. What is that? That's a seven-year marriage as a young girl and
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:07.380]   then a widow, probably from her mid-20s until she was 84. But she was faithful to what the
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:15.720]   Lord called her to do, and he rewarded her with the sight of the Messiah. He was pleased
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:26.580]   with Anna, and that's what matters ultimately. So, in other words, your sovereign good God
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:34.360]   is able to stun you with a boast out of nowhere, and he is able to keep you chaste and fruitful
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:44.960]   and happy, unmarried, until you are 84. Now here are my concluding brief four simple pieces
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:59.300]   of counsel. One, don't look twice at an unspiritual man. Yes, spiritual men are far too rare.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:08.780]   That's one of the biggest problems of the day. But they do exist, and God is guiding
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:19.620]   their lives. Number two, be an integral member of a doctrinally solid, loving church. It
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:29.180]   may have 60 people in it and no 20-somethings, while the church with all the hip singles
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:38.640]   and weak doctrine has thousands. But guess where boas may choose to go to church?
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:48.200]   Number three, find your joy in knowing Jesus and serving others. Marriage is not the greatest
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:57.120]   good. Faithfulness to Christ and his people around you is the greatest good. And number
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:05.060]   four, in your prayers, tell the Lord your heart's desire, and then make him your supreme
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.080]   treasure. Amen. Thank you for responding to this, Pastor
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.700]   John. And Caitlin, thanks for the articulate and excellent question. It's exactly the type
