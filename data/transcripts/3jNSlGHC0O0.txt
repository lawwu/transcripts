[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.600]   - To my mind, as far as I can tell,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.280]   the great power of quantum computers
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.380]   will actually be to simulate quantum systems.
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.440]   If you're interested in a certain quantum system
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.560]   and it's too hard to simulate classically,
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.520]   you simply build a version of the same system.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.720]   You build a version of it, you build a model of it
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.160]   that's actually functioning as the system,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.600]   you run it, and then you do the same thing
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.240]   you would do to the quantum system,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.560]   you make measurements on it, quantum measurements on it.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.880]   The advantages, you can run it much slower.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.240]   You could say, why bother?
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.240]   Why not just use the real system?
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.080]   Why not just do experiments on the real system?
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.620]   Well, real systems are kind of limited.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.040]   You can't change them, you can't manipulate them,
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.120]   you can't slow them down so that you can poke into them.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.080]   You can't modify them in arbitrary kinds of ways
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.080]   to see what would happen if I change the system a little bit.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.720]   So I think that quantum computers
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.160]   will be extremely valuable in understanding quantum systems.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.040]   - At the lowest level, the fundamental laws.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.240]   - They're actually satisfying the same laws
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.840]   as the systems that they're simulating.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.680]   - That's right.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.760]   - Okay, so on the one hand, you have things like factoring.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.280]   Factoring is the great thing of quantum computers,
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.400]   factoring large numbers.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.040]   That doesn't seem that much to do with quantum mechanics.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920]   It seems to be almost a fluke
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.800]   that a quantum computer can solve
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.620]   the factoring problem in a short time.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.200]   And those problems seem to be extremely special, rare,
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.980]   and it's not clear to me
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.420]   that there's gonna be a lot of them.
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.880]   On the other hand, there are a lot of quantum systems.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.600]   Chemistry, there's solid state physics,
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.700]   there's material science, there's quantum gravity,
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.340]   there's all kinds of quantum field theory.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.480]   And some of these are actually turning out
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.780]   to be applied sciences
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.840]   as well as very fundamental sciences.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.840]   So we probably will run out of the ability
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.520]   to solve equations for these things.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.640]   You know, solve equations by the standard methods
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.320]   of pencil and paper,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.120]   solve the equations by the method of classical computers.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.440]   And so what we'll do is we'll build versions
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.800]   of these systems, run them,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.960]   and run them under controlled circumstances
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.520]   where we can change them, manipulate them,
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.800]   make measurements on them,
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.240]   and find out all the things we wanna know.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.320]   - So in finding out the things we wanna know
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.400]   about very small systems, right?
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.960]   Is there something we can also find out
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.800]   about the macro level?
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.080]   About something about the function,
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.800]   forgive me, of our brain, biological systems?
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.080]   The stuff that's about one meter in size
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.160]   versus much, much smaller.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.920]   - Well, all the excitement is about,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.640]   among the people that I interact with,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.720]   is understanding black holes.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.560]   - Black holes.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.760]   - Black holes are big things.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.840]   They are many, many degrees of freedom.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.440]   There is another kind of quantum system that is big.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.560]   It's a large quantum computer.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.880]   And one of the things we've learned
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.440]   is that the physics of large quantum computers
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.320]   is in some ways similar to the physics
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.480]   of large quantum black holes.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.720]   And we're using that relationship.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.480]   Now you asked, you didn't ask about quantum computers
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.800]   or systems, you didn't ask about black holes,
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.680]   you asked about brains.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.040]   - Yeah, about stuff that's in the middle of the two.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.960]   - It's different.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.320]   - So black holes are, there's something fundamental
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.960]   about black holes that feels to be very different
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.920]   than a brain.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.000]   - Yes.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.680]   And they also function in a very quantum mechanical way.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.520]   - Right.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.560]   - Okay.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.360]   It is, first of all, unclear to me,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.840]   but of course it's unclear to me.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.200]   I'm not a neuroscientist.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.800]   I have, I don't even have very many friends
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.920]   who are neuroscientists.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.320]   I would like to have more friends who are neuroscientists.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.280]   I just don't run into them very often.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.120]   Among the few neuroscientists I've ever talked about
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.160]   about this, they are pretty convinced
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.440]   that the brain functions classically.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.320]   That it is not intrinsically a quantum mechanical system
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.360]   or doesn't make use of the special features,
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.160]   entanglement, coherent superposition.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.120]   Are they right?
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.680]   I don't know.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.080]   I sort of hope they're wrong,
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.600]   because I like the romantic idea
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.400]   that the brain is a quantum system.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.240]   - Yeah.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.520]   - But I think probably not.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.320]   The other thing, big systems can be composed
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.720]   of lots of little systems.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.400]   Materials, the materials that we work with and so forth
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   are, can be large systems, a large piece of material,
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.840]   but they're big and they're made out of quantum systems.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.880]   Now, one of the things that's been happening
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.280]   over the last good number of years
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.400]   is we're discovering materials and quantum systems
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.880]   which function much more quantum mechanically
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.320]   than we imagined.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.720]   Topological insulators, this kind of thing,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.200]   that kind of thing.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.880]   Those are macroscopic systems,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.560]   but they're just superconductors.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.580]   Superconductors have a lot of quantum mechanics in them.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.720]   You can have a large chunk of superconductor,
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.480]   so it's a big piece of material.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.320]   On the other hand, it's functioning and its properties
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.520]   depend very, very strongly on quantum mechanics.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.880]   And to analyze them,
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.920]   you need the tools of quantum mechanics.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.160]   Bye now.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.900]   (upbeat music)
