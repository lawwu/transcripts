[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   Already, the common ancestors of Neanderthals and modern humans probably had a brain as
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.960]   large as ours, and it's almost certainly the case that Neanderthals were communicating
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.960]   in ways that are probably pretty complicated, complex, and amount to some kind of language.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.160]   But some people think that language in its modern form is not that old and might coincide
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.960]   with the later Stone Age, Upper Paleolithic Revolution, 50 to 100,000 years ago, and might
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.560]   be specific to our lineage, and that there might be a qualitative shift in the type of
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.720]   language that's being used.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.480]   There's been one incredibly interesting and weird line of genetic evidence that was so
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.080]   weird that a lot of people I know dropped off the paper.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.800]   They just didn't want to be associated with it because it was so weird, and they just
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.840]   thought it might be wrong.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.680]   But it's stood up as far as I can tell, it's just so weird.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.160]   So the line of evidence I'm talking about is one based on epigenetic modification of
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.160]   genomes.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.560]   So just to explain what that means, the genome is not just a sequence of letters, DNA letters,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.040]   adenines, thymines, guanines, and cytosine, ACTG.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.280]   It also is decorated in anybody's cells by modifications that tell the genes when to
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.140]   be on and off in what condition.
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.480]   So an example of such a modification is methylation in cytosine-guanine pairs.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.640]   So this turns down a gene and makes it not functional in certain tissues.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.880]   And this methylation is bestowed by cellular environments and differs in different cells
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.820]   and also in different species to identify which genes are more active or more passive.
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.920]   And it's not directly encoded by the ACTGs locally, it's encoded by something else and
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.680]   sometimes even passed on by your parent directly.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.300]   So it's really very interesting.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.120]   So this can be read off ancient genomes.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.480]   The methylation pattern survives in Denisovan and Neanderthal genomes, and we can actually
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.680]   learn which genes were turned down and turned up.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.840]   So work by David Gochman and Liron Carmel and colleagues created these maps of where
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.680]   in the Neanderthal genome, where in the Denisovan genome, and where in modern human genomes
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.480]   genes are turned on and off.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.120]   And there's a lot of technical complexity to this problem, but they identified differentially
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.200]   methylated regions, several thousand sections of the genome that were consistently and very
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.640]   differently turned down or turned up in Neanderthals and modern humans.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.040]   And when they looked at the set of differentially methylated region, roughly a thousand of them,
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.400]   that were systematically different on the modern human lineage, and asked what characterized
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.320]   them, was there particular biological activities that was very unusual on the modern human
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.080]   specific lineage, there was a huge statistical signal that was very, very surprising and
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.160]   very, very unexpected, and it was the vocal tract.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.120]   So it was the laryngeal and pharyngeal tract, and because you can actually learn from little
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.200]   kids with congenital malformations, when a gene gets knocked out by an inborn error of
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.760]   genetic inheritance, kids will have, for example, a face that looks different or a vocal tract
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.520]   that looks different and so on.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.580]   You know what the effect of knocking out these genes is.
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.440]   We can actually imply directionality to how the modern human specific changes are, and
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.840]   the directionality is to change the shape of the vocal tract, which is soft tissue not
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.760]   preserved in the skeletal record, to be like the way ours is distinctive from chimpanzees.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.720]   So in the shape that we know is very helpful for the articulation of the range of sounds
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.960]   we use that chimpanzees don't have in their laryngeal and pharyngeal tract.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.340]   So even though we don't have surviving hard tissue, like skeletons, from this part of
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.640]   the body, we now have this methylation signature, which suggests that these changes have occurred
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.600]   specifically on our lineage and are absent in both the Neanderthal and Denisovan lineages.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.320]   So if you think this change in the vocal tract is important in language, which seems possibly
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.800]   reasonable, then maybe that's telling you that there's very important changes that have
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.520]   happened in the last half million or few hundred thousand years, specifically on our lineage,
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.640]   that were absent in Neanderthals and Denisovans.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.640]   [end]
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.700]   you
