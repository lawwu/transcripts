[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:17.960]   the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter, reading verses 26 and 33.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.000]   In the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, John answered them, saying,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.600]   "I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you whom ye know not, and I knew
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.720]   him not.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.240]   But he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:51.360]   see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him, the same is he which baptizeth with the
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.140]   Holy Ghost."
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.880]   I want to consider those statements with you in the light of that portion that we read
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.160]   this morning earlier from the book of the Acts of the Apostles, beginning at the 18th
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.840]   verse of the 18th chapter and going on to the 7th verse of the 19th chapter.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.600]   Now let me explain what I am doing.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.080]   Those who meet here regularly will understand and see at once what it is I have in mind.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.200]   But let me remind all of you of the context of what we are doing.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.840]   Here in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, the Apostle reminds us of what
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.040]   is, after all, the essence of the Gospel and its message.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.980]   He reminds us, if you like, of what it is to be a Christian and how we are made Christians.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.680]   So he starts off with this tremendous assertion that in the beginning was the Word, and the
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.120]   Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.800]   But then that the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.960]   The great story, the great facts concerning our blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.640]   But why did he come?
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.080]   Why did he ever come into this world?
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.040]   Why did he ever live?
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   After all, why did he ever die on that cross?
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.560]   Why did he rise again?
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.040]   What is the object of it all?
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.840]   Well, according to the Gospel it is this.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.000]   He came unto his own, and his own received him not; but as many as received him, to them
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.200]   gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name, which were
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.800]   born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of men, but of God.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.720]   And in addition to that, he came that we might receive of his fullness.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.720]   So John says in the 16th verse, "And of his fullness have all we received, and grace upon
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.720]   grace."
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.800]   Now that's what it means to be a Christian.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.960]   Oh, not that you have some vague belief in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.960]   No, no.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.400]   It means that you receive of his life, of his fullness.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.640]   And that's the matter that we are considering together.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.720]   Now the apostle goes on to indicate to us why it is that people are not receiving this
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.960]   fullness and are not even aware of it, many of them.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.640]   And the first great difficulty that he puts before us is this whole question and difficulty
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.560]   of being confused as to who the Lord Jesus Christ is.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   You remember he tells us the story how people were a bit confused by John the Baptist.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.520]   John the Baptist was a most unusual man in every respect.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.720]   And there he was preaching in the wilderness, strange men with a fiery message, clad in
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.000]   camel hair shirt, leather girdle, eating nothing but locusts and wild honey, an amazing phenomenon
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.200]   and an extraordinarily penetrating message.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.000]   And we are told that the people listened to him and they came to the conclusion that he
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.560]   must be the Christ.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.360]   So they sent their deputations to him to ask him whether he is the Christ or not.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.440]   And John answers by saying, "I am not the Christ.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.320]   I indeed," he says, "baptize you with water.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.320]   But there cometh one mightier than me, the lecher to whose shoes I am not worthy to enter.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.640]   He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire."
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.960]   In other words, we have got to be perfectly clear about this, that John the Baptist and
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.740]   his message do not constitute Christianity.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.280]   In other words, there is nothing more vital at the very outset of this business than the
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.280]   thing that is put in the beginning of all the Gospels, namely this contrast between
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.720]   the baptism of John the Baptist and the baptism of Jesus Christ, which is a baptism with the
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.560]   Holy Ghost and with fire.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.000]   Well now then, we have been looking at this, we have been examining these two baptisms,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.080]   and we have been doing so hitherto in terms of what we are told in the third chapter of
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.800]   the Gospel according to St. Luke, from verse 1 to verse 17, where we have an extended account
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.640]   of the teaching and the preaching of John the Baptist.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:32.880]   And John goes out of his way to show that his is merely preparatory, that he merely
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.000]   leads us to Christ, he is the man preparing the way.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.680]   And he has told us that the great difference is that with our Lord's teaching and baptism
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:49.960]   there is this thoroughness, actually to the root of the trees, honesty demanded, thoroughness,
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.080]   bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.360]   And he went on to show, using the great quotation from Isaiah, the radical nature of this new
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.800]   life that is in Christ, "The crooked shall be made straight."
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.560]   Not just a little improvement on an occasional corner here and there, as you see them doing
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.680]   with the roads, but a new road.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:23.160]   Rebirth, new beginning, regeneration, rough places shall be made smooth.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.040]   In other words, the great emphasis is this, that the main essential difference between
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.600]   these two things is that in Christ comes new life.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.800]   Not something you add on to your life, not mere religion.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.840]   Religion is the great enemy of Christianity.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.800]   Religion, you know, is that which people take up in a bag, as it were, on Sunday morning
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.880]   and put down again and forget all about it.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.320]   That's not Christianity, that's religion.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.400]   And there are many types of religion.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.360]   But Christianity is characterized by this element of life.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:07.160]   I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.960]   This is the great thing, this abundance, this overflowing.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.720]   It's the great theme of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:20.400]   Well now, the way I say to come on to all that and to get some understanding of it is
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:29.240]   to be absolutely clear about these two baptisms, baptism of John the Baptist, baptism of the
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.240]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.280]   You see, as John says here, "I knew him not, but he that sent me to baptize with water,
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:42.200]   that's God, the same said unto me, 'Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.040]   and remaining on him.'
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:52.440]   He the same is the one which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.440]   Very well.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:59.760]   Now then, Hamming looked at it like that in terms of the teaching of John the Baptist.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.920]   It seemed to me that it might be helpful if we considered it just a little bit further
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:15.960]   in the light of this extraordinary illustration that we have of this very matter in that paragraph
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:21.760]   that I read to you at the beginning out of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.480]   These two extraordinary cases that are recorded here.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.160]   The first is the case of this man Apollos.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.500]   We read a certain Jew named Apollos, born of Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.120]   in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.440]   Now you remember the incident.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.800]   Let's get the story, the history, clear in our minds.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.200]   The Apostle Paul had made a very brief stay at Ephesus, but he had to go on.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.480]   He was going up to Jerusalem.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:59.360]   But he had left behind him there these two travelling companions of his, a tent-maker
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.280]   of the name of Aquila and his wife Priscilla.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:10.600]   The Apostle had met them and they had become his travelling companions, but he had left
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.520]   them at Ephesus when he had gone up to Jerusalem himself.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.120]   Then we are told that after the departure of the Apostle, this man Apollos arrived at
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:26.280]   Ephesus and he began to speak in the synagogue.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:33.240]   But we are told that these two most ordinary people, Priscilla and Aquila, listening to
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.720]   him saw very clearly that there was something lacking, something missing.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:47.000]   So at the end of a service one day they took him aside into their home and they just told
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.840]   him the way of the Lord more perfectly.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.080]   And from there on his ministry was transformed and he became a most amazing man.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.440]   You remember how we read in the first epistle to the Corinthians that he was obviously such
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:09.760]   a remarkable man and such an astonishing preacher of the gospel, that he had a tremendous influence
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.680]   in Corinth, so much so that a party had formed around his name.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.420]   They should not have done that, that was very wrong, and Apollos was very grieved with them
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.420]   for doing it.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.760]   But it did happen, and there were actually people in Corinth who thought that Apollos
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.560]   was a much greater man and preacher than the mighty Apostle Paul.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.120]   So you see he became a very remarkable servant of God in the church.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.360]   Well there's the one case, and the other is this case which we are told of at the beginning
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:42.800]   of the nineteenth chapter, where Paul, having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.560]   And finding certain disciples he said unto them, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.340]   ye believed, or better, did you receive the Holy Ghost when you believed?"
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.560]   And all the rest of the story that happens.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.680]   And we are told that the men were about twelve.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:04.320]   He met some twelve disciples, and you remember the facts concerning them.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:16.000]   Well now then, here we have these two interesting incidents which help us to understand yet
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.880]   more deeply, I trust, the contrast which is drawn in the four Gospels between the baptism
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.880]   of John and the baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.840]   His baptism with the Holy Ghost and with fire.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:40.320]   Now what makes this so interesting is that these people appear here well after the days
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.800]   of John the Baptist and of our Lord himself, at least twenty years afterwards.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.920]   The Gospel had been preached for twenty years at least before these incidents ever took
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.920]   place.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.600]   And that's what makes them so interesting.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.200]   So far we've been looking at the preaching of John the Baptist before our Lord sets out
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.560]   in his public ministry.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:07.240]   But now here we are looking back at the public ministry of our Lord, even his death and resurrection
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.920]   and ascension, twenty years at least afterwards, here are these people like Apollos and these
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.960]   twelve men at Ephesus in this condition.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.960]   Now there can be no doubt at all that this has been recorded for us in order that we
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.280]   might be instructed by it and through it.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.240]   History like this is not recorded without it having some very definite and specific
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.320]   object.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.560]   Many other things that happened in the ministry of these various apostles which obviously
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.560]   are not recorded.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.640]   It would take volumes and volumes to record them all.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.480]   What we have is a selection.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:52.500]   And clearly the Holy Spirit led Luke, inviting this to select these incidents because they
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.460]   convey an aspect of the truth.
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.480]   It isn't merely the case of Apollos.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.560]   If it were only Apollos, well then we'd understand it quite well.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.600]   Apollos appearing as he does in the epistle to the Corinthians and having been such an
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.420]   important man in the church, it would be natural that we should be given a bit of background
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.960]   history so that we should know something about the men.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.920]   But in the case of these twelve men at Ephesus, there is no such argument.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920]   We know nothing about them.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.960]   We don't know who they were nor what they turned out to be.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.480]   But the truth about them, I want to try to show, is exactly the same as that concerning
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   Apollos.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:37.600]   And therefore I deduce that the reason why the two incidents are recorded for us is that
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:44.600]   they might help us to understand more deeply and thoroughly this essential difference between
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.440]   these two baptisms.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.840]   Baptism of John, baptism of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:58.960]   Now, I'm doing all this, as you know, because it seems to me that one of the great tragedies
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:05.360]   today is that so many people have never realized the difference between these two things.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.440]   As I've been trying to show, there are so many who are content with the baptism of John
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.000]   and think that that's Christianity.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.600]   This ancient error is still being repeated.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.640]   There are still people who think that religion is Christianity.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.880]   It's almost incredible, but it's a fact.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.400]   This is the great problem, it seems to me, in the life of the Christian church today.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:34.680]   And the high road to any revival or true reawakening and repossession of power is to understand
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.600]   this vital and essential difference.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   Very well.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.840]   Let me try to put before you this morning, at Inouyet, the big principles that seem to
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.880]   me to be taught by these two incidents.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.120]   We shall have to go into the details, God willing, on subsequent Sunday mornings.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.760]   But let's look at the picture as a whole this morning.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.200]   Let's get this big impression.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.200]   What do we find?
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:03.840]   Well, the first thing I would say that is taught here clearly is this, that there are
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:10.600]   evidently grades or stages in the Christian life.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:16.000]   Now, this surely needs no demonstration.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.800]   We are told about this man, Apollos, in verse 25.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:27.640]   This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spake
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   and taught diligently.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.800]   Now, that's really not the best translation here.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.640]   I am reading out of the Authorized Version.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:40.880]   Of course, he was diligent, but what Luke really said was this, that he taught accurately,
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:50.640]   accurately, not diligently, accurately, the way, the things of the Lord.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:58.440]   But then you see, we read here in verse 26, "He began to speak boldly in the synagogue,
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:05.240]   whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them and expounded unto
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.760]   him the way of God more perfectly."
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:14.480]   Now, you see, the old Authorized translators at this point were very inconsistent with
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:20.640]   themselves, because the word translated by them as "more perfectly" is the same word
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.920]   as you have there in verse 25, which they translated "diligently" with "more"
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.680]   added to it.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.320]   Same word with this prefix.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:39.320]   He taught accurately, they explained and expanded unto him the way of God more accurately.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.800]   Well, very well, you see, you've simply got to take these two words, "accurately,"
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.120]   "more accurately."
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   It is because of that that I deduce that there are stages, there are steps in the Christian
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.240]   life, there are grades.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.840]   It is possible for a man to be a Christian, and yet for him not to understand these things
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.180]   as accurately as he should.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:11.200]   It is possible for him to get a more accurate understanding.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.760]   Very well, and take the case of these men at Ephesus.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.280]   We are told about these that they were disciples.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.920]   Paul having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:32.680]   Now, all the authorities that agreed that the word "disciples" means disciples of
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.160]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.800]   It means Christians.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   Whenever this word is used in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, now this is what
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.960]   is said by all the learned commentators.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.320]   It isn't my idea.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:51.000]   They say when this word is found like this alone, it always means Christian people.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.440]   Disciples means Christian people.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:59.400]   But again, the whole point of the story, as it's told in those seven verses, is that
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.880]   though they were Christians, they were defective.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.360]   And the Apostle had to deal with them.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.880]   And the end of the story of these people is so different from what it was at the beginning.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.600]   This is this great contrast.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:20.120]   Apollos, before he'd been dealt with by Priscilla and Aquila, Apollos afterwards.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.200]   These twelve men at Ephesus, before the Apostle had instructed them, the same men after he'd
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   instructed them.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   Do you notice the difference?
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.840]   You see, they are moving from one level to an entirely different level.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:38.640]   I therefore deduce this principle that there are levels, that there are grades, that there
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.560]   are differences in the Christian life.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.160]   And that this is one of the first things, of course, that we have to grasp.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:55.120]   Now, here is a point that I could illustrate to you, oh, almost endlessly from the long
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.360]   history of the Christian church.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.160]   I could do so in the case of many individuals.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:10.320]   There are some of them that stand out perhaps so clearly that they've become quite famous.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.840]   Take the case again of John Wesley.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.840]   And what happened to him on that famous occasion of the 24th of May, 1738.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.400]   Here was a man, you remember, brought up in a godly home, his father a clergyman, his
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:31.280]   mother an exceptionally godly woman, and a young man who'd always taken these things
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.120]   very, very seriously.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:39.800]   Indeed, he gave up his brilliant career at Oxford, where he was a fellow of his college,
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:45.280]   to go across the Atlantic to preach to benighted pagans out in Georgia.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.000]   There was nothing the men wouldn't do.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   These things meant so much to him, and yet he wasn't clear about these things.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.760]   But coming back, you remember he met those Moravian people on the boat and in the great
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.160]   storm.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.120]   John Wesley was hit immediately by this great fact.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.960]   Here they were in a terrible storm in mid-Atlantic, and it looked as if the ship might go down
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.480]   at any moment.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.840]   John Wesley was troubled, he was afraid.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.600]   But he noticed that these Moravian brethren were not afraid at all.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.200]   That they went on as they'd gone on when the sea was calm.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.480]   They went on praying, they went on praising God.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.720]   They seemed to be rejoicing in the midst of the storm.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.460]   And he felt tremendously convicted.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.860]   He said, "Those people have got something that I haven't got.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.000]   Is what I've got Christianity at all?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.280]   If that is Christianity, well then I haven't got it.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.800]   My Christianity is something that I do.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:44.000]   But when I need comfort and strength and consolation and hope and an ability to look into the face
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.760]   of death without whimpering and crying and being alarmed, well I haven't got it."
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.080]   And he saw that that was true Christianity, but he didn't possess it.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:21:00.040]   Well then he came back, and under the instruction of these people, he was given an understanding
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.400]   of the great doctrine of justification by faith only.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.800]   He was relying too much upon his works, and he came to see this doctrine quite clearly.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:14.680]   But still, his heart, as it were, wasn't changed.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.280]   He'd seen it with his head now.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.240]   He'd got it clearly in his mind.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.240]   And he really believed it and was preaching it.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.800]   But he didn't feel it.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.960]   He wasn't conscious of it as a living power within him.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.960]   And then you remember the great occasion.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:35.720]   He goes to that little meeting here in Aldersgate Street in London, and actually they wasn't
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.720]   even preaching.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.520]   But this man was reading out of the preface of Martin Luther's commentary in the Epistle
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:46.040]   to the Romans, and he says that as that man was reading out of the book, "my heart was
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.680]   strangely warmed."
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:55.280]   And he was given an assurance that Christ had died for him, even he, John Wesley, and
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:00.120]   his sins, and that he was reconciled to God.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.680]   And immediately he became a different man.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.800]   He had his ups and downs, I know, and he had other great experiences, but that was really
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.120]   the turning point.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.680]   In other words, he thought at first that, well, he said, "I've become a Christian.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.680]   I wasn't a Christian at all before.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.320]   I thought I was, but I wasn't.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.440]   This is Christianity."
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:25.560]   But later, looking back upon it, and with wisdom and with scriptural understanding,
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.840]   he came to see that that explanation was not right.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:39.280]   So when he brings out a new edition of his journals in 1770, he put a footnote to that
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.160]   statement that he had become a Christian at this point.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.120]   He says, "No, that wasn't right."
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:54.640]   He says, "I was a Christian before, but I only had the faith of a servant, not the
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.920]   faith of a son."
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:01.560]   And what happened, he says, there was that I moved from the faith of a servant to the
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.560]   faith of a son.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.040]   And of course, the difference is so great that at first he really believed that he'd
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.520]   never been a Christian at all.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.320]   He was a Christian, but he was on this level.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.840]   He was lifted to that level.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.640]   There are grades, gradations, stages.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.640]   Now this is the thing, I say, that is illustrated so extraordinarily in these two incidents.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.880]   Let me give you another.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:31.200]   And I'm choosing my illustrations deliberately in order to deal with the theologians.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.040]   They say, "Oh, you're quoting a man like John Wesley, Arminian."
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:39.600]   All right, I'll quote Charles Haddon Spurgeon, Calvinist.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:47.760]   And Charles Haddon Spurgeon said that the difference between these two stages is, in
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:54.560]   his opinion, greater than the difference between the non-Christian and the Christian in the
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.560]   first stage.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.560]   Look at it like this.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.560]   There's a man who's not a Christian at all.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.680]   Here's a man then who becomes a Christian.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.280]   Then here's a man who has this other experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:13.560]   Now Spurgeon said that the difference between this high level and the first level is actually,
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:20.280]   in his opinion, greater than the difference between the beginning Christian and the man
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.120]   who's not a Christian at all.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.040]   Now that's a serious statement, isn't it?
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.040]   But it's very true.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.520]   And of course it is something that has been illustrated so abundantly in the history of
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.520]   the Church.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.440]   Now I've been talking in terms of individuals, and as I've said, I could add many others
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.880]   to what I've been saying.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.400]   But look at it in general.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:50.160]   You read the accounts of the great revivals in the history of the Church, and this is
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.240]   what you'll find.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:25:01.400]   That when a revival comes, you'll have large numbers of people who receive such an experience
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.560]   that again they say at first that they were never Christians at all.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.560]   Now I've known such people.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.220]   I've known many such people.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:18.240]   And their testimony was, "Well, you know what happened to us in 1904 and 5 was such
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.640]   that we rarely doubted whether we were Christians at all before."
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.360]   But they actually know that they were.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:31.600]   They may have been Christians for fifty years, attending their place of worship regularly,
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.280]   enjoying the preaching of the Word, reading their Bibles, studying books on the Bible
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.280]   and so on.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:44.960]   But oh, it was a kind of up and down existence, and perhaps more down than up very often.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.600]   And often it seemed a task and almost a burden which they were carrying.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:56.840]   Then comes this tremendous experience of the Holy Ghost coming down upon them in a meeting,
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.120]   and they were lifted up into the heavens and transformed completely, and were never the
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.120]   same afterwards.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:11.800]   Now, there are endless stories of that description in the history of revivals in the Church throughout
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.800]   the running centuries.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:20.160]   All I'm therefore deducing is this, that there are patently and clearly grades, stages,
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:26.040]   steps in the life and the experience of the Christian.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:32.960]   And that unless we recognize that, we are falling into a fundamental error.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.840]   Now what makes a man a Christian is that he believes the truth.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.880]   You can't be a Christian without that.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:45.760]   And these incidents, as I want to now go on to show you, bring this out very clearly.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:51.880]   But what I'm trying to establish is that though you are a Christian, it doesn't mean
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.000]   that you're already complete.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.840]   That's the question we have to ask ourselves.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.200]   And we have to ask it urgently, of course, for this reason.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.880]   Why is the Christian Church so impotent today?
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.560]   Why is she counting for so little, with all the desperate need that is in the world round
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.320]   and about us?
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.000]   Why don't we act in society as these early Christians did?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.680]   We are told about these that they turned the world upside down.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.880]   They acted as a kind of level, the influence spread.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.820]   Ordinary, ignorant people with no influence or authority, they had this tremendous impact.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.960]   Why haven't we got it?
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.960]   That's the question.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.800]   And we start by facing this point that I'm holding before you.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.240]   Now, in order therefore to make it still more clear, let me put it like this in the form
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.960]   of a second principle.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:49.520]   Let me show you what it is possible for a man to have and still need something more,
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.560]   and a good deal more.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.880]   Now look at the case of this man, Apollos.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:00.880]   Let's examine ourselves in the light of this man.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.560]   Let's see how we compare with him.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:08.120]   Let's see what we've got in the light of what we are told about Apollos, before Priscilla
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.080]   and Aquila dealt with him.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.920]   The first thing we are told about him is that he was mighty in the scriptures.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.480]   Mighty in the scriptures.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.720]   You know what that means.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.320]   His scriptures were the Old Testament only, of course.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:28.120]   There was no such thing as New Testament then, but he'd got the Old Testament.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.720]   That's what is meant by the scriptures.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:35.600]   And he was mighty in the scriptures, which means this, that he knew them.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.840]   In his knowledge of them he was mighty.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.960]   He'd studied them.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:45.880]   He was an able man, a very learned man, eloquent, so on.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:50.920]   And there he'd been brought up in Alexandria, and as a Jew, they'd got their synagogue
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.840]   and they'd translated the Old Testament, you remember, into Greek, the translation
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.960]   of the Septuagint.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.360]   And he had not only possessed it, but he'd read it and he'd studied it and he really
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.680]   knew it.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.800]   And he was able to handle the scriptures.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.520]   Mighty in the scriptures.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.120]   He knew not only the stories and the history, he knew the teaching of the prophets.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.180]   He knew the teaching of the Psalms.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.360]   And he'd got a grasp of this.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.760]   And he could reason out of it and he could handle it.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.920]   He was really a mighty man in his knowledge and understanding of the scriptures and in
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.040]   his ability to use them.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.360]   That's true of him.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.640]   But still more important from our standpoint is this.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:37.280]   We are told this man was instructed in the way of the Lord.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:43.120]   Now this is the important matter, because a Jew, a Quay Jew, could be mighty in the
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.480]   scriptures.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:52.120]   But this man, over and above that, had received this oral instruction.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.920]   That's the meaning of the word translated here, instructed.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:01.680]   He hadn't read it in books, he'd been instructed by word of mouth, oral instruction,
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.160]   preaching and teaching, conversation.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:08.960]   People had given him this instruction in the way of the Lord.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.480]   Now the Lord is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.000]   The word Lord is enough to establish that.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.600]   He had received this oral instruction concerning the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:28.000]   But even if we hadn't got the word Lord, this other expression is more than sufficient
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.120]   to show that he had been instructed in the Christian gospel and its salvation.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.520]   The way, the way of the Lord.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:41.640]   Now those of you who are instructed in the scriptures, who know your book of Acts, will
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:48.280]   know that the Christian way of life and of salvation is so frequently referred to in
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.360]   this book as the way.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.960]   The way, that's the term used with respect to it.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.760]   So he was instructed in the way, the way of the Lord.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.040]   Let me give you some illustrations of this.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.200]   We can't take anything for granted in these matters.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.680]   Indeed, we've got it in the 26th verse here.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:11.160]   We are told he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, whom when Aquila and Priscilla
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:20.160]   had heard, they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way, the way of God.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.200]   God's great purpose and plan of salvation in his Son, the way.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.000]   Now, but it's not only in this chapter.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.680]   There are other instances of it and I'm anxious to hold them before you.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:37.480]   We are told at the beginning of chapter 9 in verse 2 about Paul before his conversion,
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:43.560]   that he, breathing out the threatenings and slaughter, went unto the high priest and desired
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:49.240]   of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, that's
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:57.080]   it, any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.480]   This way, the Christian way.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.400]   That's the way that Apollos had been instructed in.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:10.800]   But then you've got it again in the 16th chapter in verse 17.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:16.040]   The same, we're told about this demon-possessed girl, the same followed Paul and us and cried
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:23.000]   saying, "These men are the servants of the Most High God, which show unto us the way
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.920]   of salvation."
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.840]   The way of salvation.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.440]   That's the way that Apollos had been instructed in.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:36.480]   But in a most interesting way, we are told subsequently in this very 19th chapter that
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.800]   we are considering twice over this expression is used, first in the 9th verse.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:50.640]   But when divers were hardened and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:56.320]   multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.640]   of one terrorist.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.160]   And in the 23rd verse you've got it.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:07.840]   And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.840]   That way.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:15.200]   Now this is the expression that is used constantly, you see, in the book of the Acts of the Apostles
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.240]   concerning the Christian way of salvation.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.800]   Let me give you another one.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:26.320]   Again, in the 22nd chapter you've got an illustration of this same thing.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:35.280]   Paul now giving his testimony, verse 4, "And I persecuted this way unto the death."
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.600]   And finally, in the 24th chapter, there are two illustrations of it.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:46.960]   In the 14th verse, where we read, the apostle again on trial says, "But this I confess
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:54.000]   unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.880]   believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets."
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.520]   And the last illustration of all is in the 22nd verse of that same 24th chapter.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:10.440]   And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, there
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:16.520]   it is, he deferred them and said, "When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.000]   know the uttermost of your matter."
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.440]   Well now then, the point is about Apollos, that he'd been instructed in the way of the
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.280]   Lord, in the way of salvation in Christ Jesus.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.200]   He'd had this oral teaching with respect to that.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:36.080]   But then, you see, to make the thing still stronger, we've got this further statement
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:50.880]   about him, that he "spake and taught accurately the things concerning the Lord, knowing only
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.440]   the baptism of John."
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.880]   I've already dealt with this, but I do want to underline it again.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.440]   He spoke and he taught accurately.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.720]   It wasn't some vague, indefinite, nebulous idea that he had of it.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.280]   He was able to speak accurately about it.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:15.260]   He'd got the facts concerning our Lord, and the purpose and the object of his coming,
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.000]   that he was the Messiah, John the Baptist that taught that.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.240]   You remember we are told there in that first chapter of John's Gospel that we are looking
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:27.440]   at in the thirty-fourth verse, "And I saw on bare record that this is the Son of God."
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.400]   He'd already said, "Behold, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.240]   That's the minimum.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.240]   This man, I suggest, had more than that, because he'd been instructed in the way of the Lord,
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.040]   and he was able to teach it accurately, the things concerning Jesus.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.960]   That's what he was able to teach accurately.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.640]   Well, you see, this is all true of Apollos.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.280]   Then you can add to that his fervency of spirit.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.800]   He was fervent in spirit.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.160]   It really means this, that he was boiling over in the spirit.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.120]   He was what they call today "keen."
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.040]   He was enthusiastic.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.040]   He was zealous.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:14.400]   Now, there are some authorities who say here that spirit should be spelled with a capital
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:21.080]   S. I don't believe that, but if that is true, well, it makes this case much stronger.
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:28.240]   If he was fervent in the Holy Spirit, well, you see what it's possible for a Christian
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.980]   to have and still be in a very defective position.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:37.280]   But I personally believe that this is a reference to his own natural spirit, that he was a man
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.480]   who was naturally a fervent man, a zealous man, an enthusiastic man.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.520]   Whatever he believed, he was all out for it, and so was this man, Apollos.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.040]   And then the last thing we are told about him is his courage.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:56.600]   He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and it wasn't an easy thing to do.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:02.200]   The synagogue was controlled by the Jews, and the Jews hated this teaching that that
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:07.260]   despised Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God and the Savior of the world.
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.880]   They detested this teaching.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.880]   They reviled it.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.680]   And yet here are some men who saw certain of these things that he boldly preaches it
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:20.920]   in the synagogue of the Jews, knowing what the Jews had done to so many of their fellow
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.320]   countrymen who had become Christians.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.680]   There is no fear about this man.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:31.480]   This man, when he believes a thing, he is ready to stand for it, whatever it may cost
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   him.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:38.680]   And boldly, with courage and with enthusiasm, he delivered this message in the synagogue.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:44.580]   Well now, here you see is what we are told about this man.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:51.740]   And yet Priscilla and Aquila, listening to him, say to one another, "What a pity.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.740]   What a pity.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:57.660]   He's all right as far as he goes, but he just doesn't know."
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.940]   So they draw him aside and they speak to him.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.340]   Now, about the people in Ephesus, we've really got the same thing.
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:08.060]   As I pointed out to you, they're called disciples, and that's enough, quite enough.
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:13.060]   Disciples, you go through the book of Acts, you'll find disciples always means believers
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.220]   in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.780]   But to settle it once and forever, the Apostle Paul put this question to them.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:24.500]   "Did you receive the Holy Ghost when you believed?"
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.500]   Believed what?
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.900]   Well, obviously believed on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.140]   They wouldn't be disciples if they had not believed on him.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.380]   And the Apostle knows that they have believed.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.980]   So he says, "Did you receive the Holy Ghost when you believed?"
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.620]   And again, everybody has to agree about this.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:47.100]   It refers only to a belief in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.340]   But what I'm trying to show you is this.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:57.020]   You see, that a man can have all that and still need a lot.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:03.180]   These people are Christians, and yet it's obvious to Priscilla and Aquila and to the
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:07.980]   Apostle Paul that there's something lacking, that there's a need.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.780]   Now that's the thing that comes out.
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.260]   Well, now then, what is it that constitutes this need?
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.860]   Well, I'm only going to put it as a principle this morning because it's obviously something
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.820]   we'll have to work out in greater detail.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.700]   The third principle, therefore, is this.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:28.020]   The thing that makes the vital difference between these two conditions is the baptism
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:31.580]   with the Holy Ghost.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.580]   You see, that's the whole point of both incidents.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:42.420]   We are told about Apollos knowing only the baptism of John.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:45.420]   That's the significant thing we are told about him.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:50.780]   He is in this condition, which is recognized by Priscilla and Aquila, because he only knows
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.900]   the baptism of John.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:55.620]   And the same thing is told us about these other people.
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:59.120]   When they say to the Apostle Paul, "We have not so much as heard whether there be any
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.860]   Holy Ghost," he said unto them, "Unto what then were you baptized?"
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:07.580]   And they said, "Unto John's baptism."
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:12.460]   And then at the end, Paul puts his hands upon them, and they were baptized with the Holy
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.460]   Ghost.
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.460]   And the Holy Ghost came down upon them.
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:20.340]   So you see, the object of the two incidents is to establish this difference, knowing only
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:21.820]   the baptism of John.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.300]   He doesn't know about this other baptism.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:28.660]   Here are people who say again, "We've only known the baptism of John," and Paul
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:34.260]   tells them about this other baptism and gives them this other baptism as the channel and
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.660]   the vehicle of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:44.740]   So that's the thing that constitutes the difference between the two positions in both
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:54.500]   cases, is this difference between the baptism of John and the baptism with the Holy Ghost.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:59.020]   You see, it's the same point once more.
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:06.220]   As long as we remain on that first level, we are lacking in this more perfectly, as
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.140]   it's put, more accurately, this further knowledge.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:15.740]   And here, I say, is the whole tragedy with so many people, that they remain in this first
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:21.100]   stage and seem to know nothing about that other stage.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:27.140]   Now then, let me just, to round off this general introduction this morning, put this last principle.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:32.420]   What then is essential to receiving this baptism with the Holy Ghost?
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:37.740]   Or what is essential that we may move from the one incomplete condition to the other
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:38.740]   condition?
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.660]   Now, don't misunderstand.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:42.820]   These people were Christians.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:44.700]   Apollos was a Christian.
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.660]   These men at Ephesus, the twelve men, were Christians.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:51.260]   What's necessary in order that we may move from one to the other?
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.500]   Well, it's quite clear.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.100]   We must be honest.
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:02.460]   When Priscilla and Aquila took Apollos on one side and began to speak to him, it's
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:05.140]   obvious that he was ready to listen.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.140]   He didn't resent it.
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.140]   He's honest.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.940]   He's ready to listen to what they've got to say.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:13.420]   Likewise, these men put the question by the Apostle Paul.
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:16.580]   He said unto them, "Unto what then were ye baptized?"
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.580]   And they said, "Unto John's baptism."
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.980]   Now, you see, John the Baptist himself has made this point.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.580]   Don't begin to say, "We've got Abram to our father."
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.300]   Don't fall back on your ancestry.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.340]   Don't say, "My father was a great Christian.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.100]   My grandfather was a noble saint."
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.380]   Oh, don't begin to say such nonsense as John.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:36.620]   Look here, it's you I'm dealing with, and God deals with you, not your ancestors.
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.460]   You can't ride into heaven on the back of your ancestors.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.260]   Be a man, don't be a stone.
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.660]   Well, here it's the same.
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:47.700]   We've got to be honest, and we've got to be ready for examination, and we've got
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.060]   to give truthful answers.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:53.420]   We've got to stop trying to make excuses for ourselves.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:43:01.100]   But then, in addition to honesty, we need instruction.
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:06.220]   "Chrysilla and Aquila took him unto them, and expanded unto him the way of God more
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.220]   perfectly."
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.220]   Instruction.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:14.460]   The Apostle Paul does exactly the same with the men at Ephesus.
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:18.260]   And this is a matter of instruction.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.540]   It's not just a matter of experience, it's a matter of instruction.
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:24.780]   What do the Scriptures teach?
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:25.780]   So we need instruction.
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:27.740]   That's why God has appointed preaching.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:31.020]   That's the purpose of the Scriptures, that we don't say, "Well, now I've got what
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.460]   I want, and I don't want any more."
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.860]   The question is, my friend, have you received the full instruction?
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:41.300]   It is fundamentally a matter of teaching and of instruction.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:49.020]   And lastly, of course, humility is absolutely essential.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.580]   Are we ready to be instructed?
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:57.700]   Now this is the glorious thing that comes out about this man Apollos, and it's wonderful.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:02.780]   Quite apart from the Christian faith, it's always a good thing to look at the noble character,
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.780]   isn't it?
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:07.260]   And what a big man this man Apollos was.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.820]   Can you conjure up the scene?
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.380]   Here is this man Apollos.
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.340]   He was a born Jew.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.060]   Not only that, he was brought up at Alexandria.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.420]   Alexandria in those days was one of the greatest cities of the world.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.140]   It had been built by Alexander the Great.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:26.580]   He put everything of the best that he knew of in the whole world into it.
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:31.340]   He wanted to make it the city of all cities and of all times.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:36.340]   And it was a famous city, not only for its gorgeous buildings, but for its learning.
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.740]   The philosophers went there.
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:41.820]   There was a great school of philosophers there, and the Jews were there.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:47.500]   All the cultured people of the earth seemed to concentrate upon Alexandria.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:51.620]   So it was a place of great learning and of great culture.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:54.540]   And he'd been brought up in a place like that.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.940]   And you know when you've been brought up in a place like that and you're confronted at
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:02.780]   the end of a service by just a tent maker and his wife, just ordinary country people
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:08.620]   as it were, it's not an easy matter to listen to them, leave alone to receive instruction
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.620]   from them, is it?
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:13.060]   And on top of this, we are told he was an eloquent man.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.140]   Now there's a great deal of dispute about this word.
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:18.100]   Some say it should be translated learned.
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.100]   Others argue for eloquence.
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.500]   Of course, probably both are true.
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.060]   The man was both eloquent and learned.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.320]   He was a man of culture.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.880]   He was a man who not only had tremendous knowledge, he could express it.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:35.020]   He was a cultured man in the highest sense of the word, with all the learning of Alexandria
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:39.460]   behind him and all the polish of such a cultured city.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:43.700]   Then, as I've reminded you, this word mighty is used about him.
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.580]   It's used about him twice over.
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:46.940]   He was mighty in the scriptures.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.540]   In the last verse, he mightily convinced the Jews.
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:54.540]   Anything this man did was always done in a big way.
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:46:00.540]   He was not just a humbling speaker, not some stuttering man lacking in eloquence.
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:07.140]   He was a mighty man in understanding, in knowledge, in expression, in everything.
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.300]   And he could handle an argument, and he knew how to marshal his facts.
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.980]   His logic was irresistible.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:16.060]   Here, in other words, was a most astounding man.
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:22.580]   It's not surprising that people in Corinth, as the expression today has it, fell for him
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.980]   and thought that this was the man of the Apostle Paul.
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.020]   There was such brilliance about the man in every sense.
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:34.420]   Well, now, there he is.
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:41.820]   But you know, if he hadn't been the humble man that he was, he would never have known
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:45.060]   the higher possibilities of the Christian life.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:50.420]   He would just have continued as he was when Priscilla and Aquila heard him preaching in
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.940]   the synagogue.
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:57.500]   But in spite of all the knowledge and the brilliance, the erudition, and the charm,
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:03.220]   and the polish, he is ready to listen.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.300]   And he is ready to listen, I say again, to a tentmaker.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:12.340]   Now, we are told here that when Aquila and Priscilla heard, they took him.
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.740]   Most of the authorities that agreed that the order has been reversed there and shouldn't
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:16.740]   have been reversed.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.740]   It should read like this.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:22.540]   He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him—you
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:27.220]   notice that earlier on in the 18th verse we are told that when Paul took leave of the
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:32.220]   brethren and sailed thence into Syria and took with him Priscilla and Aquila, that is
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:35.300]   undoubtedly the right order.
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.460]   Why am I emphasizing that?
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:42.020]   Well, I'm doing so for this reason, that it seems to be quite clear that of this married
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:45.060]   couple the woman was the abler person.
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:47.620]   She had the better understanding.
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:52.140]   And the implication is that the instruction that was given to Apollos was given mainly
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:48:00.220]   by Priscilla, the wife of a tentmaker, a woman.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.700]   And yet this man is ready to listen.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.700]   Why?
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:12.480]   Well, not only because he was humble, the man was a Christian, and he detected something
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:16.660]   in these people, in their personalities, in their manner of speech, in what they were
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.660]   able to tell him.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:24.460]   And he knew that that was right, that they had something, if you like, that he hadn't
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.700]   got, and he was ready to listen.
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.220]   And my dear friends, this is the first essential.
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:36.780]   John Wesley was ready to listen to those humble Moravian brethren who had nothing of his learning
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:40.420]   and his culture and his knowledge.
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:44.140]   But he knew they'd got something that he hadn't got, and he wanted that something.
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.420]   He wished that he could face death without being frightened.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:54.580]   He wished that he could praise God with his last breath instead of whimpering and crying.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.580]   So he was ready to listen.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:01.620]   And Apollos was ready to listen to Priscilla and to Aquila.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:10.900]   And no man will ever know this blessing that the Lord Jesus Christ alone can give us, unless
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:17.900]   he is humble, unless he is teachable, unless he is ready to say, "All I am and all I
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:19.180]   have is not enough.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:21.620]   The question is, do I know God?
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:23.780]   Do I know Christ?
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:28.900]   Have I the love of God shed abroad in my heart?
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:33.060]   Am I ready to face anything, death included?
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:40.380]   Am I able to say with the Apostle Paul, "To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain,
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.940]   that I may be with Christ, which is far better."
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:50.460]   Is there this thirst in you, this hunger, this desire, this longing?
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:58.660]   It is the essential prerequisite to the obtaining of the blessing.
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.180]   Amen.
[00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:06.620]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
