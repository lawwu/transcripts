[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - Pastor John, we have two related questions on prayer,
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.720]   possibly two podcasts.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.080]   The first question is, should we pray before eating?
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.920]   Why or why not?
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.160]   And the second question is,
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.880]   how is food made holy by the word in prayer?
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.920]   1 Timothy 4, three through five.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.660]   - Right, Tony, I think it will probably be better
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.500]   to break these up.
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.800]   I don't know, you can decide.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.420]   I'm gonna talk about the second half of the question
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.000]   about 1 Timothy 4.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.860]   I think that is so fundamental, really fundamental,
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.440]   to the way we live in this world
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.480]   that it might fill up a podcast on its own.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.320]   And then we shift over to, should we pray before meals?
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.040]   So here's the verse, I'll read it.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.800]   1 Timothy 4, three through five.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.800]   In the last times, people will forbid marriage,
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.680]   which probably means sex is viewed
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.800]   as something of a problem here,
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.300]   or maybe too dirty or too fleshy
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.220]   or too something, too unspiritual.
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.500]   So people are gonna forbid marriage,
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.080]   they're gonna require abstinence from foods.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.400]   So eating and sex are the two issues here,
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.720]   that God created to be received with thanksgiving
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.800]   by those who believe and know the truth,
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.720]   for everything created by God is good
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.360]   and nothing is to be rejected
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.840]   if it is received with thanksgiving,
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.840]   for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.200]   So behind this verse, evidently, is a false teaching,
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   a false spirituality that solves the problem
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.920]   of sex and food with asceticism, strict asceticism.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.800]   No marriage, no eating certain foods.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.360]   That's the way they're solving the problem
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.440]   of the temptations of sex to be controlling
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.360]   and to be overpowering and the temptations of food
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.240]   to take control of us.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.240]   And I find it, Tony, amazing that 2,000 years ago,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.040]   Paul would be dealing with the two massive temptations
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.440]   of our own day.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.360]   Several years ago, I was speaking to a group
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.360]   of about 800 missionaries at a conference,
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.120]   and I spoke, I was told that they're gonna fire
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.120]   that afternoon five missionaries for pornography.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.320]   And I said, really?
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.720]   The mission board was gonna fire them?
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.480]   And I said, okay, I need to address this.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.200]   So I changed my plan, addressed sexuality issues,
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   and when I was done, a woman came up to me.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.280]   So I'm talking mainly to the men, right?
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.880]   And a woman came up to me and she said,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.880]   if you had replaced the word sex everywhere in your talk
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.480]   and put the word food in, it would have landed
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   on almost every woman in this room the way it would have.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.720]   And I thought, really?
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.120]   Now, I don't know whether she's right or not,
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.480]   but that she said it is really significant.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.160]   So here's Paul addressing those two things.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.400]   In fact, if you go to 1 Corinthians 6,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.880]   where Paul says, all things are lawful for me,
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.880]   but I will not be dominated or enslaved by anything,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.240]   the two things that he chooses to address
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.520]   in the next verses are the stomach, food,
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.240]   and prostitution, sex.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.120]   So clearly, these two huge appetites
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.840]   that human beings have, created by God,
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.360]   the sex appetite and the hunger appetite,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.040]   can become idolatrous.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.680]   They can become enslaving,
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.760]   and that's why false teachings arise.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.380]   We gotta get this under control, right?
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.640]   We gotta figure this out.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.640]   And so let's just not, let's let our best people not marry,
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.740]   and let's have everybody figure out foods
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.200]   that they should abstain from,
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.000]   and we'll conquer this thing
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.240]   with the asceticism pea shooter.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.080]   And Paul said, he said in Colossians,
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.860]   that's not gonna get anywhere.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.800]   So what's Paul's solution?
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.760]   And the question actually dealt with his solution.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   His solution was food and sex are made holy
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.320]   by the word of God and prayer.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.560]   And so if we ask what word?
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.840]   You have a word in mind, Paul, a word of God?
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.360]   What kind of prayer do you mean and when?
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.180]   And we're not left without any pointers.
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.680]   I mean, the very context, verse four,
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.180]   says God created them to be received with thanksgiving.
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.640]   So that's the prayer.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.000]   The prayer is a prayer of thanksgiving.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.880]   Thanksgiving is the dethroning of a God
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.680]   and turning it into a gift, right?
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.560]   We've said this before.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.640]   Sex is starting to get this power over us,
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.640]   starting to exert an enslaving God-like force on our life,
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.520]   and thanksgiving humbly says, you are not a God,
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.480]   you are a gift from God,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.420]   and I will let him determine how this gift is to be used,
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.680]   and I will be filled with humble thanksgiving.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.200]   I will not worship you, I will receive you,
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   or not as a gift by God's design,
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.180]   and I will thank you.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.640]   So thanksgiving, I think, is what is meant by the word,
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.200]   it is sanctified by prayer, prayer in the sense of,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.640]   I am thanking God for you,
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.800]   and therefore you are not gonna compete with God,
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.580]   you're gonna be a means of my worship
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.280]   rather than a competition with my worship.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.560]   And that leaves me with the question,
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.440]   well then, what's the word of God?
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   It is made holy by the word of God and prayer,
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.320]   and he had just said earlier in the previous verse
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.400]   that these things were made to be enjoyed
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.800]   by those who know and believe the truth.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.280]   So evidently there's truth here in the word of God
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.280]   that will help us not mistreat these gifts,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.000]   and I sat down and I thought about this,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I thought, where has Paul dealt with this?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.860]   And here's the one I thought of.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.840]   Back in 1 Corinthians 10,
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.760]   eat whatever is sold in the meat market
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.320]   without raising any question on the ground of conscience,
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.320]   for the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.880]   Now what's he doing there?
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.920]   He's saying this food is clean,
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.080]   you may eat this food,
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.080]   and how is he sanctifying it for them?
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.760]   He reaches to a word of God, Psalm 24.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.040]   The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.920]   So my general answer to the question,
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.480]   what does that mean, is if we're dealing with sex,
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.360]   if we're dealing with food,
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.080]   we prevent them from having undue control
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.480]   or an undue place in our lives
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.720]   by bringing them both under the word of God,
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.680]   like the earth is the Lord's,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.880]   and so you don't need to worry
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.600]   that you are eating this meat that was offered to an idol,
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   it belongs to God, he's offering it to you as a gift,
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.140]   and if we're saying thank you to him,
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.120]   we are dethroning God and making it a gift.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.720]   So I would just have everybody put all the gifts of God,
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.120]   not just sex and food, but all the gifts of God
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.960]   in the context of his word,
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.560]   let his word define their place,
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.200]   and then be filled with thanksgiving
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.280]   and let it overflow in prayers of gratitude.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.400]   - Yes, thank you, Pastor John,
