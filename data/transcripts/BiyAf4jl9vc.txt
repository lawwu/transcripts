[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   It creates a lot of uncertainty because of the requirements for like doing the analysis are so
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.040]   unclear and like the definition of like what is a major environmental effect has basically changed
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.920]   over time which is of course fine but it does mean that it's very unclear how long it's going
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.560]   to take and what is going to be involved and whether anybody is going to sort of litigate
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.600]   your decision. People are basically able to sue groups for like not completing the analysis
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.840]   thoroughly enough. They can't permanently stop the project because all you need to do is basically
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.720]   show that you've documented your things thoroughly enough and so it basically creates all this new
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.840]   uncertainty where people will like very deliberately try to avoid the process because
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.000]   they do not know how long it will take and how much it will cost to get their project approved.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.600]   So making like a business decision as to whether like do a new like offshore wind development or
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.760]   you know develop a new forest resource or something like that it's it's very hard to do.
