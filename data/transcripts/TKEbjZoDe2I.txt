[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   In the following sermon, Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones is preaching from St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, Chapter 5 and Verse 5.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   This is obviously a part of the statement that the Apostle has been making from the beginning of the chapter, and which we've been considering together.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   His primary object is to show the certainty and the finality of our salvation as the result of justification by faith only.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   And that he demonstrates, you remember, by saying three things.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   It gives us peace with God. It enables us to stand in this grace and to have the grace of God upon us and showered upon us through Jesus Christ.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   And indeed, he says, it enables us to rejoice at the glory in hope of the glory of God.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Then having said that, you remember we saw last Friday night that he wants to emphasize this,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   that this hope is something which is so certain that tribulations, far from detracting from it or shaking us in our hope,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   actually have the effect of strengthening our hope.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Not only so, he says, but we glory, we exult, we make our boast in tribulations also.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   They don't rob us of this hope. They don't interfere with our certainty.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Indeed, he says, and he gives us an argument which he works out and which we worked out together,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   it promotes our certainty of the hope. We rejoice, we glory in tribulations also.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And he says that comes to pass in this way.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   The tribulation worketh patience and patience worketh testing, being approved what is called here experience.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And that in turn worketh and leads again to hope.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So we saw, you remember, last Friday night, that in the Christian life you both start with hope and you end with hope.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   The moment we realize the truth about justification by faith only,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   at once we are given an understanding of that hope that awaits us, and we glory in it.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So we start with it. That, you see, in turn leads to patience by means of tribulations.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   You start with the hope and because you've got it, the effect of tribulations is to make you a patient endurer.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   You have patience. And that in turn leads on to this testing and this approvedness.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And that in turn leads to a larger conception of the hope.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So you start with hope and you end with hope.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And it's all worked out in terms of this expression of his worketh.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It brings it to pass. It produces it.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And therefore we see that the apostle has worked out this great circular argument of his,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   all of which is designed to show that the Christian, the man who does know that he is justified by faith only,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   should be secure and certain in this hope.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Very well. He hasn't quite finished his statement.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   He still has to bring out his climax.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And the climax in this respect is what we have before us in this fifth verse this evening.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   He really has completed his argument, but he adds to it.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   He says something on top of it. He underlines it, if you like.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   That's what he's doing in this verse.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Having arrived back at hope, he says, "And hope maketh not ashamed."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Now what does he mean by this?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Well, the first thing we have to understand is that he is referring to the present and not to the future.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   There have been some expositors who seem to me to have missed the point here completely
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   by imagining that what the apostle is saying here is this,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   that the man who has this hope in him will not be disappointed in the great day of judgment,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   that he won't be put to shame then when the final and the last test comes.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   That, of course, is perfectly true.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   But here, surely, the apostle is not referring to the future.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   He is referring to the present, to the actual experience of the believing Christian.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   While he is in this life and in this world, and what he means therefore is this,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   that we shall never be put to shame in this life.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Neither shall we be put to shame on the great day, but we shall never be put to shame in this life.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It doesn't matter what happens.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   There will be trials, there will be problems, there will be tribulations, there will be difficulties.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Yes, says the apostle, but if you've got this hope, you'll never be put to shame.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   You'll never feel ashamed.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   You'll never be disappointed.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   You'll never feel that you are let down, and you yourself will not let yourself down.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Hope maketh not ashamed.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Now, I believe the best way of understanding this is to go to that chapter which we read at the beginning,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   the first chapter of the second epistle of Timothy,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   where the apostle, you remember, puts it very definitely and specifically in the twelfth verse.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   He is talking about this selfsame thing.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   He was a prisoner when he wrote the letter, and to be in prison is very discouraging.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   He was an old man, as it were, and he'd become a sick man, and here he is in prison.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   So he's therefore in a condition and in circumstances which is very calculated to depress us.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   But he says that he's not depressed.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   He says, "For the which cause I also suffer these things."
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Nevertheless, he says, "I am not ashamed."
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   That's it.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   I'm in the midst of these trials and troubles and tribulations, but I'm not ashamed.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I'm not ashamed of my position or of my calling.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I'm not in any sense disappointed.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   and I'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   His hope doesn't put him to shame, you see.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   He's not disappointed. He's not let down by his faith and by his belief.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   He says, "I am in these circumstances, but everything is all right."
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Now, he's writing to a young man called Timothy,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   and Timothy was not as clear about these matters as the apostle.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So he says to him in verse 8, "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   nor of me his prisoner."
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   You see, it's the same idea. "Don't you be ashamed," he says.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Now, a man who isn't clear about the Christian faith is liable to be put to shame by circumstances.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And the temptation that was coming to Timothy was to be ashamed of the apostle and of the Christian life,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   in this sense, that he wasn't quite certain what answer to give to people who said,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   "Well now, look here, this apostle makes tremendous claims, and we remember his assured preaching,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   but look at him. How do you explain a thing like this?
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Why does God allow this? Why does the Lord Jesus Christ allow a man like this to go through all this,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   if your gospel is true?"
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Now, the moment we become doubtful and we can't answer people who say things like that, we are ashamed.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So the apostle says to this young man, Timothy, "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord."
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And then, did you notice how he put it at the end again, in the case of Onesiphorus?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   "Here is the apostle, you see, in prison. This thou knowest that all they which are in Asia turned away from me."
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   But he says, "The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus."
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Why? "Well, he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my shame."
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   In other words, Onesiphorus was so strong in the faith, and had such an understanding,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   that he, far from being put off or disappointed, or turning away from the apostle and feeling that there was nothing in it after all,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   he was not ashamed of the chain, but went to the apostle and ministered unto him there in the prison.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Well, now that's the idea which we've got in this word. Hope maketh not ashamed.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   That isn't what it does.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   But I think it's important to point out this, that here the apostle is using a figure of speech, of which he was rather fond.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   It's the figure of speech which is known as "Laetertes."
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And what does that mean? Well, it means this.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   It is a way of asserting a positive by giving the negation of the opposite.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Now, we've already come across a notable example of it in the first chapter in the 16th verse.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   The apostle says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ."
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   What he means is, "I am very proud of it. I make my boast of it. It is to me the greatest thing in the whole world."
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   But he puts it negatively. This is said to be a favorite figure of speech of the English.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   They don't like to make positives. They prefer to put it in negatives, "I am not ashamed," instead of saying, "I'm very proud of it."
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   The apostle, you remember, on another occasion says that he was a citizen of no mean city.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   What he means is a very great city.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   But he does sometimes add force to the statement by putting it in the form of Laetertes.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And here is an instance of that hope, "Maketh not ashamed."
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   What he really means is this, that hope, far from making us ashamed, or producing a tendency to be ashamed,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   it rather does the exact opposite. It leads to glory.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   In other words, we're back again to the thing he said at the beginning.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Not only so, but we glory in tribulations also.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And he says that is what hope always does.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Hope doesn't make you feel ashamed.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   The man who rarely has got this hope and who sees it, is a man who is going to not only overcome these trials and tribulations,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   he's going to boast in them. He's going to glory in them.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   As we've seen, he works it out in detail.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   But here he is putting it, I say, in this very strong form.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Not only does it never let you down, it really puts you on your feet.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Listen to him saying it once more in the eighth chapter, in verse 37.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It's precisely the same thing.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   "Nay," he says, "in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Now, "Hope maketh not ashamed" is just another way of saying we are made more than conquerors.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Not only do we go through it, but we are over and above that there's something thrown into the bargain.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   We are enabled to rejoice and to exult and to glory in it all.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Now, this is clearly therefore a most important statement.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And it's not surprising that the apostle went on to this addition.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   "And, my dear friends, this has been the universal testimony of the saints and the martyrs throughout the centuries.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   It is this hope which was there before them and which they saw so clearly
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   that enabled them to die the glorious deaths that they died."
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   It's universal. It starts, you see, with Stephen, in a sense.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And it's been continued ever since. That's the glory of the history of the martyrs.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Why were they enabled to die so gloriously?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Well, they were sure of the hope being justified by faith.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   They rejoiced in the hope of the glory of God.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   They knew it. They were certain of it.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   So they could smile in the face of these cruel men who were thus putting them to death.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And it's a wonderful story. Read the story of the martyrs in every age and throughout the centuries.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And in each case, you will find that their secret was that they knew exactly where they were going.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   They'd had such views of it, such glimpses of it.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   They had such a certainty of it.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Hope maketh not ashamed? No, no. It makes us certain.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   It makes us more than conquerors, and so we are enabled to look steadfastly at it,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   and even to glory in the things that normally produce depression, the things that normally defeat us.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Very well. There is his great assertion. But wait a minute.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   What is it exactly that enables us to do this?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   How can a man ever come to this position?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   What is it that gives one this final kind of certainty about the hope that is set before us?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   What is it that gives us this ultimate assurance of the blessed hope which will never fade away?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Well, the apostle answers that question in his next statement, which is a very great statement indeed.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Now then, let's look at this. This great and glorious and momentous statement.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Because, he says, this is partly the explanation of what he's been saying.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   You can take it like that, that the because means that for this reason.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Or, if you like, you can take it as a kind of additional reason and further reason.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   It doesn't matter which. I believe both are true.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   But as this great statement seems to me not to be grasped as it should,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   and as indeed I have a feeling that its full content and meaning is not even brought out in the expositions,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   even of Hodge and of Haldane, I want to look at these words with you rather carefully.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   The first thing we therefore look at is the expression "the love of God".
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Now here there is no need for argument, because most are agreed about this.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   That the love of God here means not our love to God, but God's love to us.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   That is of course vital. He's not talking here about our love to God that follows,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   but he's really talking about our knowledge of God's love to us.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   The love of God. Not our love of God, but God's love of us.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   The love of God. Very well.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Now then, here's the phrase, "the love of God is shed abroad".
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   That's the important statement.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   What's it mean?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Well it really means to be poured out.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   It's the same expression that you get in connection with the coming of the Holy Ghost
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   in the second chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   In verse 17 for instance.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   "And it shall come to pass" says the Apostle Peter quoting Joel,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   "that in the last day saith God, I will pour out of my spirit."
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I will pour out of my spirit.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   "Upon all flesh."
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And in verse 33 again.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   "Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   he hath shed forth this."
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Poured it out.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Now that's the meaning of the expression.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   This isn't my idea, everybody's agreed about this.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   That this is the meaning of the terms.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   It carries the idea of profusion.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   A kind of brushing forth.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Not just a little trickle, but a pouring forth of the spirit.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   A shedding abroad of the spirit.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   As it's translated here in the Authorized Version.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Hold on to that term.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Shed abroad.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Poured out.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   The next word is the word "in."
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And "in" doesn't mean "upon," and "in" doesn't mean "into."
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   But it means "in."
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   As the translation has it.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   It means that it's permeating every part.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   It's filling it.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Until it's overflowing as it were.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   "In."
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   And the last expression is of course, "our hearts."
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   What does "heart" mean here?
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Well, it undoubtedly means the very center of our being and our personality.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   It certainly does not mean the mind only.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   It certainly doesn't mean the understanding only.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   It includes the emotions.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   It includes the feelings.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   It includes the sensibilities.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   He chooses his words carefully.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   The love of God, he says, is poured out, shed abroad in our hearts.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Now then, what does he mean?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Well, he says that the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   By the Holy Ghost.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Which is given unto us.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   The Holy Ghost is given unto us all as Christians.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And it is the Holy Ghost who is given unto us as Christians,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   who he says, sheds abroad in the hearts this love of God.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   And when he has done that to a man, such a man glories in tribulation,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   and glories in hope of the glory of God.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Very well, let's come back to it and look at it again.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Now, I say it is very important that we should give their full weight and meaning to these terms.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Shed abroad means shed abroad, poured out.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   The whole idea is one of profusion and of abundance and of overflowing.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   It means torrents.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Very well, you see the implication, don't you?
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   If the love of God is thus shed abroad in our hearts, there's no doubt about it.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   There's no uncertainty about it.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Because the whole idea is one of a super abundance and of a great profusion.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And what he says here, therefore, is that the Holy Ghost in this way
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   gives us an abundant assurance of God's love toward us.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which he has given unto us.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   The Holy Ghost then makes us abundantly certain and assured of the love of God to us
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Now, we shall find later that the apostle puts this in the eighth chapter, in the sixteenth verse,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   indeed starting in the fourteenth verse.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   For he hath not received the spirit of bondage again to fear,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   but he hath received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   The Spirit itself, or himself, beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   It's the same idea. That's what it leads to.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And the apostle John, of course, he says the same thing in his first epistle.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   You'll find it in the first epistle in the fourth chapter and in the sixteenth verse,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   which here is translated like this.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   "And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us."
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Somebody has translated that like this.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   We know the love that God hath to us and we confide in it.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   We know and have believed.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   We are certain of it.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   That's the position.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And again, it's in the context of the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Now, what does this mean?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Well, this is what I want to emphasize.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   This is not merely something that we believe.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   This is not merely something that we deduce.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   This is not merely something that we argue out.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   It isn't that at all.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Because all that is indirect and this is direct.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   He doesn't say that as a result of our faith and the working out of this argument,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   we come to the conclusion that God loves us.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   That isn't what he says at all.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   He says the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   It's something that the Holy Spirit does, not something that we do as the result of an argument.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Now let me show you the difference.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Up till this point, you see, the apostle has been deducing.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   He's taken us through the steps of the argument.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Tribulation worketh patience, patience worketh experience.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   And do you remember we worked it out?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   We go through life and these things happen to us and we say, "Well, now then,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   the very fact that God is allowing this to happen to me is the proof of the fact that I am a son,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth."
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   "It's a terrible thing," says the 12th of Hebrews, "not to be chastened."
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   God doesn't chasten the bastards.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   He chastens only his sons, whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   and scourgeth every son whom he calleth.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   If he be not chastened, he are bastards and not sons.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   So we work out the argument.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   We say, "This is happening to us. I'm receiving persecution.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   I'm being misunderstood. People are behaving harshly.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   I'm suffering for righteousness' sake.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Therefore, I deduce that I am a son, I am a child," and so on.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   You remember we went through the arguments last Friday night.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Now, but all that is deduction.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   In that way, I am deducing the love of God.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   By means of my faith, I am working out my argument,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   and I can arrive at that kind of assurance and of certainty.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   And it's all perfectly right.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Yes, but says the apostle, "You know, there's something that goes beyond that."
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Over and above your intelligent apprehension of it,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   over and above your intelligent and intellectual deduction of it,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   there is a direct and an immediate assurance given
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   by the Holy Ghost which sheds abroad.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   You're overwhelmed by it. It's poured in your heart.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And there is no uncertainty.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And it isn't merely the result of your own deduction in this way.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Now, this, it seems to me, is something that is of the greatest importance
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   and the greatest value.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   I've had occasion to say before that there is no aspect of Christian truth,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   it seems to me, that has been so sadly neglected in this century
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   as this particular teaching.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   It's been the result of that pernicious teaching of "take it by faith,"
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   which has negated this glorious, experimental, immediate knowledge
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   of the love of God to us.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   This isn't something you take by faith.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   It is something the Holy Spirit does to you.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   He sheds abroad in the heart the love of God.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And, of course, it leads to certain results.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   It is the thing that enables people to be in this position.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Peter says of Christians, referring to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   "Whom having not seen ye love, in whom though now ye see him not yet believing,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   ye rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory."
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   In other words, this is the highest form of assurance possible to any Christian man.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   It is a form of assurance, I say again, that you do not deduce.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Now, you can deduce assurance in this way, can't you?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   You can say the scripture says, "Whosoever believeth is not condemned."
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   I believe and therefore I am not condemned, therefore I can be sure.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   It's all right.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   You can also say, I'll go to the first epistle of John,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   I will read there the tests of life and of sonship,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I will examine myself.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   If I find them, I can deduce that I am a child of God.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   It's all right.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   That's another form of assurance.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   But this is the highest form of assurance.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   You don't deduce the love of God here.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   The Holy Spirit sheds it abroad in your heart in the way that the apostle here describes.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   It's the same thing as Romans 8, 16,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   "The Spirit beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of God."
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Now then, let me give you, let me read to you somebody's testimony to support what I am saying.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Listen to a statement made by a saintly, godly Church of England vicar
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   who lived about 200 years ago and later of the name of Henry Venn.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Henry Venn was a man who was a great help to Charles Simeon when he was a young man.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   He was first of all a vicar up in Huddersfield and then went to a little place called Yelling,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   somewhere there on the borders of Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   And Charles Simeon, as a young man in Cambridge, used to ride out on his horse to Yelling
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   and was often comforted and helped by Henry Venn.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   He was at the back of the so-called Clapham sect.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Well now, listen to Henry Venn writing a letter to the Countess of Huntingdon.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   And let me tell you the circumstances.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   He writes this just after the death of his dear wife, Mrs. Venn.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   She was taken from them, the children were young and there were several of them.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Mrs. Venn has just been taken away by death.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   But this is how he writes to the Countess of Huntingdon.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I'm going to read this to you. It's a long extract, but listen to it.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   It's saying perfectly what I'm trying to say.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   He says, "I am now a living witness of the truth you so strenuously maintain
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   and of the necessity of that truth in our miserable condition here below.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Did I not know the Lord to be mine?
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Were I not certain his heart feels even more love for me than I am able to conceive?
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Were not this evident to me, not by deduction and argument, but by consciousness,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   by his own light shining in my soul as the sun's death upon my bodily eyes?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Into what a deplorable situation should I have been now cast?"
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Did you notice what he said?
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   He says, "Were not this evident to me, not by deduction and argument,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   but by consciousness, by his own light shining in my soul
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   as the sun's death upon my bodily eyes?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Into what a deplorable situation should I have now been cast?
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   I have lost all that I could wish myself to have been
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   in the partner of my cares and joys,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   and lost her when her industry and ingenuity and tender love and care for her children
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   were all just beginning to be perceived by the two eldest girls
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   and to strike them with a sense of the excellency of such qualities.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   I have lost her when her soul was as a watered garden,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   when her mouth was open to speak for God,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   and he was blessing the testimony she bore to a free, full, and everlasting pardon in the blood of Jesus.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Nevertheless, I can say, 'All is well, hallelujah, for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   at all times and in everything pertaining to me. Let him do what seemeth him good.'"
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Now then, listen.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   "Were there no Holy Ghost now to strengthen me mightily?
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Were there nothing more than a dependence on the word of promise?
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Without an almighty power and agent to explain, impress, and apply it,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   how would my hands hang down and my knees be so feeble
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   that I should faint and fall under the pressure of my cross?"
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   You see what he is saying.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   He said, "If I were only left with the promises in the word
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   and my ability to take them and to reason from them and to deduce from them,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   if it were not that the Holy Ghost is within me and impressing these things upon me,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   shedding it abroad, you see."
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   He says, "My knees would be so faint that I would fall under the pressure of my cross."
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   But on the contrary, listen,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   "I abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost given unto me.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   I rejoice in tribulation from the experience I now have
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   more than I possibly could in a less severe trial
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   that the man of sorrows is as rivers of water in a dry place
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   and giveth songs in the night."
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   You see, he is really commenting on our verse, isn't he?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   He says, "But on the contrary, I abound in hope
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   through the power of the Holy Ghost given unto me.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   I rejoice in tribulation from the experience I now have
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   more than I possibly could in a less severe trial
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   that the man of sorrows is as rivers of water in a dry place
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   and giveth songs in the night."
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Now, isn't that very wonderful?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   And I'll tell you something interesting on top of it.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   If I hadn't had my attack of influenza a fortnight ago
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   and was unable to be here a fortnight tonight,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   I wouldn't have been able to read that to you tonight
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   because I wouldn't have read it.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   I read it in bed when I had my influenza.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   I said to myself, "Here we are. This is the comment I want.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Here's the illustration that is so perfect
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   on what I'm going to say about Romans 5, verse 5."
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   There it is, you see, in a letter of Henry Wynne
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   to the Countess of Huntingdon.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   But listen, let me give you some more.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Listen to what Charles Simeon has to say about this.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   "Here you see is evangelicalism as it once was
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   towards the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   These men didn't take it by faith.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   These men knew it, knew it internally by the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   They were as certain of it as they were
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   that the sun was shining upon their bodies."
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   This is how Simeon puts it.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   He says, "It's a blessing which though not appreciated or understood
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   by those who have never received it,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   is yet most assuredly enjoyed by many of God's chosen people.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   We scarcely know how to describe it
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   because it consists chiefly in an impression on the mind
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   occult, occasioned by manifestations of the love of God to the soul."
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   You see how he puts it?
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Far from being something that I deduce as the result of an argument,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   he says, "I can scarcely put it into words.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   No man who knows it can scarcely describe it
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   because it's something internal and experimental,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   something you're absolutely certain of,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   but it's difficult to find words to express it.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   It is a blessing which though not appreciated and understood
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   by those who have never received it."
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   They think that this is enthusiasm, of course.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   They think that this is a false kind of subjectivism.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   "It is yet most assuredly enjoyed by many of God's chosen people.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   We scarcely know how to describe it
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   because it consists chiefly in an impression on the mind
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   occasioned by manifestations of God's love to the soul."
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   I've referred before to that work of John Fletcher of Midley,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   the saintly John Fletcher of Midley,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   to what he calls the manifestations of the Son of God.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   It's exactly the same thing.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Now what is all this?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Well, this is what our Lord is speaking about, of course,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   in the 14th chapter of John's Gospel,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   where he says, "I will manifest myself unto you."
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   That's what he tells.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   It is this promise of what's going to be true
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   when the Holy Ghost comes.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   He's not yet come in that way.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   He's going to come, this other comforter that he's going to send.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Or if you like, it is the sealing of the Spirit.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Or in another form, it is the earnest of the Spirit.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   It is God, through the Holy Spirit, giving us this absolutely certain knowledge
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   that we are his children, that we are heirs of the glory that is coming,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   and in the form of the earnest, giving us foretastes of it,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   giving us samples of it, giving us installments of it,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   making the thing real to us, so that we don't take it by faith.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   We know. We've tasted it. We've seen it.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   It is the love of God being made real with this impression upon the mind and the heart.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   It's a sensible something. It's experimental.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   It affects the emotions and the feelings.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   It is direct and immediate, not indirect and mediate.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   As I say, there is surely nothing more precious in the whole of Scripture.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Yet how little do we hear about it today.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   How it seems to have dropped out of evangelical teaching.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   I say because of that pernicious teaching about taking it by faith
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   and not worrying about your feelings.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   What if Henry Venn had been in that position?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   He says, "I don't know what I'd have done."
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   But he says, "God's made his love so plain and clear to me directly and immediately."
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   He's so sure of it and certain of it, in the depth of his soul,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   he wasn't taking it by faith.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   He knew it had been given to him by God himself,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   preparing him for the grievous trial that was to come to him.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   Very well, what do we say about this?
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Well, let me put it like this.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   You can be a Christian without this.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   You can be a Christian without this.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   You can't be a Christian without the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   But you can be a Christian without having the love of God shed abroad in your heart.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Well, let me put it to you like this.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Can you say that the love of God is shed abroad in your heart?
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Could you speak like Henry Venn?
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Very well then, it's for that reason I'm saying that you can be a Christian without this.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   You can have the Holy Spirit dwelling in you,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   because if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his at all.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Unless the Spirit of God is in us, we are not Christians.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   But you can be a Christian without this.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   This is something further.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   This is something greater.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   This is what Paul, in a sense, was praying for, for the Ephesians' party,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   that they might know it.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   They've known it already in the sealing.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   He wants them to know it still more,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   this love of Christ that passes knowledge.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   You can't describe it.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   It's beyond intellectual apprehension, but it's real,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   the love of Christ that passes knowledge.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   He wants them to know that in that experimental sense.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   I say, therefore, that all Christians haven't got this, but it's possible to all.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   And all Christians should have it.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   It doesn't depend upon your greatness,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   the greatness of your intellect or anything else.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Listen to what Henry Wynne goes on to say.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   He says, "My blessed Lord sent to me two preachers immediately after my loss.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   The one was a poor and most afflicted widow,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   sick, very sick in body, with two helpless children,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   destitute of raiment almost.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   And upon my asking her how she did,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   'Oh, sir, since you have been gone,' she answered,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   'I cannot tell you how much my Savior has done for me,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   though I have utterly lost the sight of one eye since you went.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   I have got better light than the sun can give.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   I feel myself so sinful and Him so full of love to me
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   that I am happy and only beg of you that I may not be carried into the workhouse
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   to be amongst so many people,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   because I feel by being alone as I am,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   I can enjoy the love and presence of the Lord more abundantly.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   But if you think it proper that I should go,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   I can go still in faith and cheerfulness.'
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   The weighty manner in which she spoke this,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   and the air of her countenance,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   was indeed such as I think I never saw.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   It was as if she saw her Lord,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   and He was attending to every word that came out of her mouth.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   This was a sermon to my heart,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   and as seasonable as the rain upon the mown grass.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   But let me give you just one other quotation before I let you go.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   I trust you are enjoying the hearing of these things being read
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   as much as I am enjoying reading them.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Listen to a man called Richard Robarts,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   a man, a minister of God, who died at the age of 36 of consumption.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Frequently he writes, 'All around me thought me about to expire.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   My cough was dreadful, and so were the pains I felt in my chest and side.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   And above all, the languor which oppressed me for a while
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   seemed almost overwhelming.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   But while nature was thus sinking,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   I felt more of the consolations and supports of religion
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   than I ever had experienced before.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Oh, with what strong and assured confidence
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   was I unable to look up to my Redeemer,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   and how gladly would I have resigned my soul into His hands!
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   What glorious manifestations of His love and mercy did He make to my soul!
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And how did I rejoice to believe that in a few days more
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   I should be with Him in glory eternal!
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   For the sake of my dear wife and friends I was willing to live,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   and saw it my duty to use all proper means to promote my recovery,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   which, however, I and everyone else, I believe,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   conceived to be impossible without a miracle.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   But for my own sake I had a desire to be with Christ.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Thus I lay in sweet suspense, as it were, between earth and heaven,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   and indeed so I have remained in general ever since.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Listen to him later on.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   A friend said to him, "I should be glad to enjoy your happiness."
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Richard Roberts at this stage couldn't speak,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   but he wrote this on a slate.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   "Believe constantly on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   and you may be much happier than you are."
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   Had I been more faithful in this respect,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   I should have enjoyed more consolation and done more for the glory of God.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Then the report goes on, "In the course of this day
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   he experienced an ecstasy of heavenly joy.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   His eyes were bathed in tears,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   and he uttered words of praise, consolation, and triumph.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   It appeared as if he was transported into paradise.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   It was evident that he experienced a foretaste of heaven.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Everyone in the room thought him dying.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   He expressed a desire to see his sister, whom he sincerely loved.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   'Oh,' said he, 'I am happy in my God, in His love.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   I am going to possess Him forever.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   I shall enter into that city whose streets are of fine gold.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Yes, the new Jerusalem from above,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   the city of the living God.'"
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   And here is my last quotation.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   He wrote like this,
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   "Since my last attack three weeks ago,
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   the Lord has been near and has manifested His love to my soul
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   in an uncommon degree.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   I have been deeply humbled under a sense of my unworthiness
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   and past unfaithfulness,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   but I have felt myself firmly fixed upon the rock of ages
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   and have been enabled to anticipate my departure from the body
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   with unspeakable delight.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   One thing has much occupied my mind,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   namely the great proneness I have ever felt
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   to rest short of all the fullness of God.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Often as it seemed within my grasp,
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   often as my soul seemed to take possession of it,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   but never did I enjoy a constant sense of it,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   of all the great salvation of God.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   However, I never gave up the hope of possessing it fully,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   and I trust that I shall now obtain my heart's desire."
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   And so it goes on.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   Now I read all that to emphasize this.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   This is something given to a man like that just before he dies,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   given to Henry Benn before the great trial of the loss of his dear wife,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   given to that other woman in poverty.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   But according to the teaching of the Scriptures, as I understand it,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   this is something that is open to us all,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   something, as Robarth says, we always ought to be enjoying.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   You see, it's only when we're brought perhaps to a deathbed
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   that we turn away from the vain things of life
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   and realize that nothing matters but this,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   and we seek it with the whole of our being, and we find.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   So I would end by quoting to you the words that I've quoted before
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   from this pulpit of Thomas Goodwin, the Puritan.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Sue him for it. Sue him for it.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Ask him for it. Don't give up.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   If ye being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   In this sense,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   can you say that the love of God has been shed abroad in your heart?
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   You see what the apostle is saying is this.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   The man who can really rejoice in glory in tribulations
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   is this man in whose heart the love of God has been shed abroad.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   He can. He's so certain. He knows it.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   So if we feel that we can't honestly say that we glory in tribulations
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   and glory in hope of the glory of God which is coming,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   well, it's really because we don't know it as we ought,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   and we should know it as we ought, and we can know it as we ought,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   and you go to him and you ask him to do it.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   You ask him to manifest himself. You plead with him to do so.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   You say, "O love divine, how sweet thou art!
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   When shall I find my willing heart all taken up with thee?
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   I thirst, I faint, I die to prove the greatness of redeeming love,
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   the love of Christ to me."
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Ask him for it. Don't be content with less.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   And he has promised to manifest himself to those who keep his commandments,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   to those who rarely seek him in this way.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   And you will find that saints throughout the centuries
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   have been able to testify to this immediate knowledge,
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   this shedding abroad of the love as Henry Wynne describes it,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   not the result of deduction or reasoning,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   but the action of the Holy Spirit in diffusing it throughout the whole
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   of the center of our lives and making us as certain of it
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   as we are of the shining of the sun in the heavens.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Has the love of God been shed abroad in your hearts?
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Do you rejoice in Christ with a joy unspeakable and full of glory?
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   It seems to me that it was given to the first Christians
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   to start off Christianity, to show us what is possible.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   It happened to the men on the day of Pentecost.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   It's happened to these others.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   It's happened to those who have sought it throughout the centuries.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   Why should you and I not know it?
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   So that we bask in the sunshine of his love,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   more sure of his love to us than we are of anything else in this world.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   Hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   the Holy Ghost, which is given to us.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   Let us pray.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
