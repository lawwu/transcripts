[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Alright Pastor John, today we address a controversy that you stirred up online
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   back on September 25th of last year, 2017.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Just as Protestants around the globe were beginning to celebrate the Reformation's 500th birthday,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   you spoiled the party with an article titled, "Does God really save us by faith alone?"
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   In which you answered, "No, we are not saved by faith alone."
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Leaving Protestants everywhere dumbfounded and scratching their heads.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   In wishing more clarity here, a podcast listener named Sam wrote us to ask this.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   "Hello Pastor John, I've read your article on justification saying that we are justified by faith alone,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   but we are not ultimately saved by faith alone.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   You argue that works must be present for final salvation or glorification to be completed.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Two questions for you. Number one, can you explain this a little further on air?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And number two, what then is the link between justification and glorification?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   From what I see in Romans 8 30, glorification is secured by our justification.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   How would salvation and works fit between the link here in Paul's mind?"
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Well thank you Sam. I love to talk about this issue because it is endlessly perplexing for people
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   and every effort we can make to clarify it the better.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So let's start with some clarifications.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   The biblical term salvation is used to cover past, present, and future dimensions of God's work
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   to bring us into everlasting perfection and joy.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Ephesians 2 8, "Having been saved."
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   1 Corinthians 1 18, "We are being saved."
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Romans 13 11, "Salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed."
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   So past, present process, future completion.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   This is why we have to be so careful about using the term justification interchangeably with salvation.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It causes so much confusion.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Justification, as we ordinarily use the term, as Paul ordinarily uses the term,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   refers not to a process, but salvation sometimes does refer to a process.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Justification is the point, point, point, like in geometry,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   where the Holy Spirit opens our blind eyes to see Christ for who he really is,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   unites us to Christ by faith alone,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   so that in that instant, at that point, we pass from being under condemnation
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   into God's being 100% for us.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   No virtue, no works in us brought about this new standing with God.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Justification is instantaneous and unchanging on the basis of the blood and righteousness of Christ alone.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We are counted instantaneously as righteous, and God is 100% for us from then on.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   We're connected with this new experience of acceptance with God by being one with Christ through faith alone,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   and that happens in an instant.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Now the question rises, how do our good deeds then fit with justification and final salvation?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And my answer is, and it's the answer of the entire mainstream of the Reformed tradition,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and really not just Calvinists would talk this way, many others would as well,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   works play no role whatsoever in justification,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   but are the necessary fruit of justifying faith,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   which confirm, this fruit confirms our faith and our union with Christ at the last judgment.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So God can make a public pronouncement with a view to these works confirming the faith
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   which alone unites us to Christ, who is alone the foundation of our acceptance as perfect in God's sight.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   So here's what the Westminster Confession says from 350 years ago.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   "Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ in his righteousness, is the alone instrument,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   the only, the sole instrument of justification, distinguishing instrument from basis,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   the alone instrument or means of justification, yet is it not alone in the person justified,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   but is ever," important word, "accompanied with all other saving graces,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   and is no dead faith, but works by love." End of quote.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Now that is an allusion to Galatians 5, 6, where Paul says,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   "In Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   but only faith working through love."
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   So the faith that justifies is the sort of faith that bears the fruit of good works, love.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   James 2, 17, "Faith, if it has no works, is dead being by itself."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Dead faith doesn't justify anybody, therefore faith without works is not the kind of faith that justifies anybody.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And these works are, and here it starts to get difficult for people, but let me see if I can help,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   these works are necessary.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Hebrews says, "Strive for the peace," strive, key word, "Strive for the peace with everyone,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   and strive for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord." Hebrews 12, 14.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   So we won't see the Lord Jesus, that is, we won't be finally saved without this "striven for holiness."
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And what is that? Or why is that?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Because the Apostle John says, 1 John 2, 4, 3, 14, other places,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   "The one who says, 'I have come to know God,' and does not keep his commandments, is a liar.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And the truth is not in him."
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Or, says later, 3, 14, "We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brethren."
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   That's how we know, it's confirmed.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   "He who does not love abides in death."
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   In other words, you haven't been born again, you haven't been united to Christ,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   you don't have saving faith because it's not confirmed by love.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   So, obedience and love are the necessary confirmations that we are born again,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   truly united to Christ by faith alone.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Or here's the way Paul says it in 2 Thessalonians 2, 2, 13,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   "God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth."
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   So, we are not justified through sanctification.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Let me say it again, we are not justified through sanctification,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   but we are finally saved through sanctification.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   That is, through a real change in our hearts and minds and lives,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   without which we will not see the Lord.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Now, people hear this, if they haven't been well taught on these things, here's what people do.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   They hear this, they say, "Whoa, necessary? These things are necessary for final salvation?"
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And they draw two inferences from that statement, and both of them are false.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Number one, therefore they say, "Final salvation is dependent on us, decisively on us."
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And here's the next false inference, "Therefore, it's uncertain. I could fail. I could lose my salvation.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I could be justified and then not be justified. A child of God might lose his justification."
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Now, both those inferences are dead wrong, both logically wrong and biblically wrong.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   The second one is wrong because the Bible says, "He who began a good work in you will complete it."
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   At the day of Christ, you won't lose it.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   And Romans 8:30 says, "Those whom he predestined, he also called, and those whom he called, he also justified,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   and those whom he justified, he also glorified." No dropouts, no dropouts at any one of those links in the chain.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   No dropouts between justification and glorification. I'll say it again.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Those whom he justified in the twinkling of an eye, by faith alone, in union with Christ, once and for all,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   will be, all of them, no exceptions, will be glorified.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   The reason no one will lose his justification is because God is the decisive worker.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   We work, but we're not the decisive worker.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Philippians 2:12, "Work out your own salvation by all means.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Strive for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Work out your salvation with fear and trembling." Why?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Because it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   So God's sovereign keeping and working is the basis of our pursuit of holiness.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   The basis of it. The basis of it. The ground of it.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   I start with the fact that I am kept. I start with the fact that I'm justified.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I start with the fact that God is 100% for me, and on the basis of that, I pursue the killing of my sin.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Here's what Paul says in Philippians 3:12. I love this.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   He says, "Not that I am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own because Christ Jesus has made me his own."
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Oh, get that logic right.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   So when Sam asks, as he does at the end, "How would salvation and works fit between the link in Paul's mind between justification and glorification?"
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Where Paul says, "All those who are justified are glorified."
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   He's asking, "How does salvation and works fit in there?"
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   The answer is this. Glorification in Paul's thinking is a process that begins at conversion.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   It doesn't begin at the last judgment. It begins at conversion and includes sanctification.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   It's consummated at final salvation.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   We know this because of 2 Corinthians 3:18, where we look to Jesus and are being chained from one degree of glory to the next.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   That's glorification right now as we look to Jesus.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And Romans 8:30, then, "All the justified will be glorified," includes the promise, "All the justified will be sanctified,"
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   because sanctification is included in glorification.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Our assurance of final salvation, which is so precious, we don't believe that people should walk around unsure.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Our assurance of final salvation rests on God's past work by Christ and his future work by the Spirit in us and both.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   One outside of us, one in us, both rooted in God's faithfulness to his covenant people.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   And I'll read this as my last verse. This is 1 Corinthians 1, 8, and 9.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   "He will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   God is faithful by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Very good. Hopefully that will clarify things for our listeners.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   It will for a few minutes. I've given up thinking I could solve this problem for people.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   And, you know, I think part of that is it's not hard to understand, but the devil hates it so much,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   he's going to constantly sow seeds, "You've got to do this. It's all depending on you," and so on.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Amen. Yeah, that is a carefully defined understanding of justification and final salvation.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   And it's rooted in a long history of careful Reformation theology. Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Well, speaking of controversy, why are Christian singles getting married later and later in life?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Our good friend Francis Chan says it's because of the prevalence of premarital sex.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Other Christians say, "Whoa, wait a minute. I think there are many other factors at play here too,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   like women trying to pay off student debt and being so busy with the work they can't pursue relationships."
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   We know singles in America are putting off marriage longer and longer, but why?
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And what hope does Pastor John have to offer those who are patiently waiting?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   That's the question on the table Monday when we return.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke. Enjoy the weekend. We'll see you on Monday.
