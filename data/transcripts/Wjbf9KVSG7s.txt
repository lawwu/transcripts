[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.320]   All righty, so I get to introduce myself today.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.360]   So hello.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.720]   I am Mike.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.040]   I am a CPA.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.280]   And let's just get started.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.680]   So as you can see from our title here,
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.400]   this is going to be a deep dive on the topic of Roth conversions.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.640]   But before we do that, before we really dive deep,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.600]   I want to take just a brief moment to make sure
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.400]   that everyone here is on the same page about one
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.120]   fundamental piece of information.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.480]   And that is, what is a Roth conversion?
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.480]   So a Roth conversion is when you move money
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.080]   from a tax-deferred account to a Roth account.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.280]   So for instance, you could be moving money from a traditional IRA
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.800]   to a Roth IRA.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.640]   And when you do that, the money that you move over--
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.280]   so the money that you convert--
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.840]   it's generally taxable as income in the year
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.040]   that you do the conversion.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.280]   So that's what a conversion is.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.920]   And there are three primary things
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.640]   that we're going to be talking about today
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.760]   that all fall under the Roth conversion umbrella.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.240]   The first one is, what are the effects?
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.560]   What are the pros and cons of a Roth conversion?
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.760]   In other words, how do we decide whether or not
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.240]   it makes sense for you to do a conversion in any given year?
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.920]   Topic number two, what can we hope to achieve
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.920]   with a smart conversion plan?
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.640]   In other words, what are the metrics
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.560]   that we can realistically hope would be
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.680]   improved by doing conversions?
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.040]   And our third topic, which we're going to hit on more briefly,
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.160]   is, how does a Roth conversion plan
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.760]   fit into a broader overall retirement tax plan?
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.840]   So digging right in here with the effects of a Roth
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.120]   conversion, in most cases, conversions
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.180]   are going to have up to three major effects.
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.760]   And these are the three things that you
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.920]   want to be looking at in any given year
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.080]   when trying to determine whether it does or does not make sense
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.440]   for you to do a conversion.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.520]   The first effect is that you will end up paying tax now
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.920]   instead of paying tax later.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.840]   The second effect is that conversions
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.000]   will let you use taxable account dollars to essentially buy
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.600]   more Roth space.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.520]   And the third effect is that Roth conversions
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.380]   will reduce your future required minimum distributions,
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.960]   your future RMDs.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.360]   And that can reduce the future tax drag on your portfolio.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.360]   And we're going to go through these one by one.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.160]   So pay tax now instead of later.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.880]   The idea here is that when you do a conversion,
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.400]   the conversion is taxable.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.920]   So you have to pay some tax right now, right?
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.800]   But then the money is going to be in a Roth IRA going forward.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.320]   So Roth IRAs are allowed to grow tax-free.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.960]   So you won't have to pay tax later as it grows.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.160]   And as long as you meet the appropriate requirements,
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.680]   you can take the money out tax-free as well.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.200]   Whereas, conversely, if you don't do a conversion,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.480]   then you won't be paying any tax right now because you
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.160]   didn't do a conversion.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.000]   But then the money is still in a traditional IRA or other tax
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.200]   deferred account.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.160]   And so you most likely would have
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.040]   to pay tax at some point later whenever the money does
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.680]   come out of the account later.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.760]   And of the three effects shown on this slide,
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.120]   this first one, paying tax now instead of paying tax later,
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.320]   this is the one that gets almost all of the discussion.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.160]   And in fact, it's very common to see this treated as if it
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.960]   is the entirety of the analysis.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.800]   It's very common to see articles and bogleheads threads where
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.020]   this is the only thing that gets brought up.
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.600]   But as we'll see in just a little bit,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.480]   this is really only one piece of the picture.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.720]   It's important to account for more than this.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.480]   Now, this effect of paying tax now instead of paying tax
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.640]   later, it can be helpful or it can be harmful.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.360]   So it can be a good thing or it can be a bad thing.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.320]   It can be a point in favor of doing a conversion
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.920]   or a point against.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.120]   And that all depends on the current marginal tax rate.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.380]   And by that, I mean the tax rate that you would pay
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.240]   on a conversion of a given size if you did
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.240]   do that conversion this year.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.440]   And how does that tax rate compare
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.880]   to the future marginal tax rate?
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.280]   And by that, we specifically mean
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.880]   the tax rate that would be paid on the dollars in question
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.040]   whenever they come out of the account later
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.880]   if you don't convert them.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.080]   So we're comparing those two tax rates.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.800]   And whenever the current tax rate,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.500]   so the tax rate on the conversion,
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.600]   is the lower of the two, then this effect is helpful.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.940]   It's a point in favor of doing a conversion.
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.080]   And conversely, whenever the current tax rate
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.400]   is the higher of the two, then this effect is harmful
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.600]   because it means you're paying tax now at a higher tax rate
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.840]   when you could have waited and paid tax later
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.760]   at a lower tax rate.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.240]   So that's not a good thing.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.640]   So this effect, it can be good or it can be bad.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.480]   It just depends on the circumstances.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.480]   Now, there are a number of caveats,
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.360]   complicating factors, that make this pay tax now
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.780]   or pay tax later thing more complicated
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.280]   than it might appear at first glance.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.700]   The first one is that when we're talking
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.660]   about marginal tax rates, your marginal tax rate
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.040]   might be different than just your tax bracket.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.180]   We often treat those two terms as if they're synonyms,
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.920]   but they're not because there are a ton
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.960]   of different things in our tax code
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.080]   where as your income goes up,
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.720]   your income tax does go up as a result of your tax bracket,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.400]   but something else also happens.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.260]   Like this additional taxable income causes you
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.400]   to become ineligible for a particular tax credit
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.720]   or something like that.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.160]   And so when you account for that factor
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.780]   plus your tax bracket, your actual marginal tax rate
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.440]   can be considerably higher than just the tax bracket
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.560]   that you're in.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.000]   And I wanna run through just a few things
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.560]   that can cause that type of effect
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.000]   that are most likely to be relevant
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.640]   in a Roth conversion analysis.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.800]   The first one is the premium tax credit.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.240]   So that's the credit for anybody buying health insurance
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.760]   on the Affordable Care Act exchange.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.280]   So that's most often gonna be relevant
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.040]   in a scenario where you retire before 65,
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.520]   so you're not yet on Medicare, but you've retired,
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.940]   so you don't have insurance through your previous employer,
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.560]   most likely, so you're probably buying insurance
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.400]   on the exchange.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.800]   And the way that credit works is that
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.400]   as your income goes up, the credit shrinks,
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.800]   and eventually it shrinks all the way to zero.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.720]   And so let's say you're 63,
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.060]   and you're thinking about doing a conversion this year,
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.320]   and you're buying insurance on the exchange.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.920]   Well, then this is something we have to account for.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.520]   Is this taxable income from the conversion
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.420]   going to be shrinking this tax credit?
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:31.320]   And if the answer is yes, that doesn't necessarily mean...
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.800]   Can we get that light switch back on?
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.640]   Thank you.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.120]   So if a conversion would be shrinking
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.960]   your premium tax credit, that's not a good thing,
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.680]   but it isn't necessarily enough to say
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.760]   that we shouldn't do a conversion.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.480]   It just is something we need to account for in the math
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.180]   in order to be doing it correctly.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.000]   Then the way that Social Security benefits are taxed,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.880]   that can also cause this type of effect.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.960]   Basically, if your income is low enough,
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.960]   your benefits are not taxable,
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.720]   but then as your income proceeds upwards
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.200]   through a particular range,
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.320]   the portion of your benefits that are taxable, it goes up.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.880]   So as your income is proceeding upward through that range,
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.040]   the actual marginal tax rate is much higher
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.840]   than just the tax bracket that you're in.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.520]   And Medicare IRMA,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.160]   that's Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount,
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.000]   and it is just a rule that says that
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.920]   if your income crosses a certain threshold
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.680]   or various thresholds in a particular year,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.600]   then your Medicare premiums two years from now
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.040]   are going to be higher.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.360]   So if we're thinking about conversions in 2024,
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.080]   if you would be 65 or older in 2026, so two years from now,
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.880]   then we want to be thinking about,
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.320]   would this conversion push you over one of those thresholds?
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.040]   And again, if the answer is yes,
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.560]   that doesn't necessarily mean no conversions,
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.440]   it just means that's something we have to be accounting for
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.480]   in order to be getting the math right.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.200]   And one thing to point out about this idea
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.680]   that marginal tax rate and tax bracket
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.600]   are not necessarily the same
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.760]   is that we need to be thinking about that
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.320]   on both ends of this analysis, right?
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.600]   We're talking about pay tax now or pay tax later,
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   and we're looking at the current tax rate
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   and the future tax rate.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.440]   In both cases,
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.320]   we're concerned with your actual marginal tax rate,
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.320]   not just the tax bracket that you're in.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.760]   Another important complicating factor
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.520]   that people often overlook is that for a married couple,
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.720]   one thing that often happens
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.120]   after either of the two people has died
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.320]   is that the surviving spouse
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.920]   is left with a higher marginal tax rate going forward.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.720]   And the reason for that is that the standard deduction
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.920]   for a single filer is only half the size
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.720]   that it is for a married couple filing jointly.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.920]   And the tax brackets only have half as much space in them.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.920]   But typically, when one of the two spouses dies,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.520]   what happens is that the household's income falls,
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.520]   but it falls by less than half
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.920]   because it's usually the smaller
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.920]   of the two Social Security benefit amounts that goes away.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.120]   And the income from the portfolio
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.720]   usually doesn't change at all, or at least not very much, right?
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.520]   It's still there, paying interest and dividends and RMDs and so on.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.720]   So the surviving spouse, they have half the standard deduction
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.120]   and half the space in the tax brackets
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.520]   but more than half as much income.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.920]   And so the result is that they're often left with a higher tax rate.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.520]   And the takeaway with respect to Roth conversions
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.720]   is that this can be a compelling point
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.720]   in favor of doing conversions while both people are still alive.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.920]   Another caveat, another complicating factor here
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.120]   is that when we're talking about that future tax rate,
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.320]   it might not be your future tax rate that we're talking about
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.720]   for a significant portion of these dollars.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.320]   It could be the tax rate that your heirs, your beneficiaries,
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.520]   would be paying on distributions
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.120]   from an inherited tax-deferred account.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.120]   And so there's a couple of things we want to be thinking about there.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   Sorry, one moment.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.920]   The first thing we want to be thinking about
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.320]   is how many beneficiaries will there be?
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.920]   Because imagine you've got one adult child
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.920]   and they have no kids of their own
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.920]   and there's nobody else you're planning on leaving any of these assets to.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.520]   Well, then it's pretty darn likely
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.320]   that the distributions themselves,
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.320]   as in the distributions that this beneficiary would have to take
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.520]   from an inherited traditional IRA,
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.920]   it's likely that those distributions
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.520]   would be pushing this person up into a higher tax rate.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.320]   And so that would be a compelling point
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.320]   in favor of doing conversions now.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.320]   Pay tax at your current tax rate, whatever it happens to be,
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.920]   so your beneficiary doesn't have to pay a much higher tax rate later.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.120]   But if you think about a different scenario,
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.920]   if you've got ten beneficiaries,
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.320]   four kids and six grandkids or something like that,
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.320]   and the accounts are going to be split up among all ten of those people,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.720]   then it's a lot less likely
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.920]   that the distributions would be pushing them up into higher tax rates.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.920]   And so this wouldn't necessarily be a point in favor of conversions
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   and could be a point against doing a conversion.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.320]   So it all depends on the circumstances.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.320]   We also want to be thinking about what are the careers,
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.320]   or just more broadly, what are the earnings levels of these beneficiaries?
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.920]   The higher their level of earnings,
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.920]   the more likely it is that they're going to be paying very high tax rates
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.320]   on distributions from any inherited tax-deferred accounts.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.320]   And so if all of these beneficiaries have high levels of earnings,
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.920]   that's a strong point in favor of doing conversions.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.720]   Whereas if these beneficiaries have more modest levels of earnings,
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.120]   that could be a point against doing conversions.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.920]   So this all just depends on the circumstances.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.120]   And then our last caveat here on this paying tax now versus paying tax later idea
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.720]   is that to the extent that you would use qualified charitable distributions, QCDs,
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   or to the extent that you would leave tax-deferred dollars
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   to charity at your death by naming a charity
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   as the beneficiary of your IRA or something like that,
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   well, then, to that extent,
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.120]   the future tax rate that we're talking about,
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.320]   it's actually zero because nonprofit organizations are tax-exempt.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.320]   They don't have to pay tax on dollars
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.120]   that they get from a traditional IRA or 401(k) or something like that.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:27.320]   And so if you anticipate a large portion of your tax-deferred balances
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.320]   ultimately going to charity,
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:35.720]   well, then, that is a pretty compelling point against doing Roth conversions
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.120]   because it means you're paying tax now at whatever tax rate you pay on the conversion
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.520]   when ultimately a good chunk of these dollars
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.120]   could have come out of the account later at a 0% tax rate anyway.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.920]   And paying tax now to avoid zero taxes later is not helpful.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.520]   So that's one thing to have in mind.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.120]   And that is the first effect of a Roth conversion.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.920]   You pay tax now instead of paying tax later,
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.720]   and it can be good or it can be bad.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   It just depends on all the circumstances.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.120]   The second effect of a Roth conversion
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.920]   is that conversions let you use taxable account dollars
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.120]   to essentially buy more Roth space.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.920]   And before getting into how that works,
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.520]   I want to make sure we're all clear on a definition
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.120]   because I actually see this misunderstanding a lot on the Vogelheads forum.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.520]   Sometimes people think that a taxable account means a traditional IRA,
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.920]   meaning that it's taxable because you take the money out and it's taxable,
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.920]   but that's not what we're talking about.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.720]   A taxable account is any account that doesn't have special tax treatment.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.120]   So a taxable account is not a traditional IRA.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.520]   It's not a Roth IRA.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.520]   It's not a 401(k) or a Roth 401(k).
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.120]   It's not a 403(b) or a Roth 403(b).
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.120]   It's not a 457 or a 529 or an HSA or an FSA.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.320]   It's none of that stuff.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   It's basically a regular checking account or a regular savings account.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.120]   Or if you went to Vanguard or Schwab or your favorite brokerage firm
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.520]   and opened up a new brokerage account that isn't an IRA,
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.720]   that's a taxable account.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   Those are the types of accounts we're talking about here.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.920]   And we call them taxable accounts because they're the types of accounts
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.720]   where you have to pay tax every year on the interest and dividends
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.920]   that you earn and so on.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:21.120]   And the idea of effect number two here is that you can use money
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.120]   from a taxable account to pay the tax on the conversion.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.120]   And when you do that, what's happening essentially
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.520]   is that you're giving up money from a taxable account
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.520]   and you're getting more Roth money.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.120]   And to illustrate how that works, I want
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.520]   to run through a very quick example of a Roth conversion.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.320]   And as we'll see, this is actually an example
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.120]   of what not to do in most cases.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.320]   But we'll get to that in just a minute.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.720]   And so we're going to keep the math easy.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.320]   We're going to assume it's a 25% tax rate.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.420]   And we're going to assume it's a $100,000 Roth conversion.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.420]   Easy math.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:58.020]   So we have $100,000 coming out of a traditional IRA.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.320]   And when you do a conversion, you have a choice.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.320]   You can have taxes withheld if you want to at any percentage you want,
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.620]   including zero.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.020]   So it's optional, but you can have taxes withheld.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.520]   And so in this example, we're going
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.320]   to assume that you do choose to have taxes withheld.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.420]   And you're anticipating a 25% tax rate.
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.020]   So again, easy math, 25% gets withheld.
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.520]   And that means that $75,000 of this conversion, $75,000
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.120]   is what actually ends up in the Roth.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.220]   The other $25,000 gets withheld.
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.420]   It goes to the IRS.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.320]   So that's one way you can do a conversion.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.820]   Or instead of doing that, you can do this, what we have on this slide.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:44.720]   Here we have $100,000 coming out of the traditional IRA.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   Nothing gets withheld.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.420]   So the whole $100,000 goes into the Roth account.
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.020]   But you still do have to pay the tax.
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.820]   And so we're just writing a check, essentially, to the IRS for $25,000.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.220]   We're using money from a taxable account to pay that tax.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.220]   And so what has happened here is you gave up money from a taxable account,
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.720]   because that's what you used to pay the tax.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.220]   But you got more Roth money.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.220]   Because in this case, $100,000 made it into the Roth.
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.920]   The whole amount made it into the Roth instead of only $75,000.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.420]   Now, this effect of using taxable account money to pay the tax
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.020]   and therefore, essentially, buy more Roth space,
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.120]   one thing to point out is that it doesn't apply to everybody.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.520]   If you don't have taxable account dollars that you could use,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.720]   well, then who really cares?
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.420]   It's not relevant.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.220]   You don't need to be thinking about it.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:39.120]   But in the cases where it is applicable, by definition,
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.120]   it's a point in favor of conversions.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.820]   This one's never a point against conversions.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.420]   The only two choices here are it does not apply
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.920]   or it's a point in favor of conversions.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.720]   And the reason for that is that taxable accounts
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.720]   have what we call tax drag.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.420]   And Roth accounts don't have that.
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.420]   And what I mean by that is that in a taxable account every year,
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.520]   you have to pay tax on the interest that you earn.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.220]   You have to pay tax on the dividends that you earn.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.520]   You have to pay tax on the capital gains when you sell something.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.820]   And we call that tax drag
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.020]   because it's taxes dragging down your rate of return.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.120]   And in Roth accounts, we don't have that.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.420]   You don't have to pay those taxes.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.820]   You get to keep the whole rate of return.
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.520]   And one thing that I know you all know,
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.020]   because this is one thing that we spend so much time
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.220]   talking about as Bogleheads,
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.620]   is that expense ratios of mutual funds,
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.220]   they're really important, right?
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.620]   And the reason that they're so important,
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.120]   the reason we spend so much time talking about that
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.720]   is because even a small difference
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.020]   in the annual rate of return
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.520]   when you compound it over many years
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.520]   is a really big deal.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.020]   And that same exact math applies to tax drag.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.120]   Even a small difference in the annual rate of return
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.120]   when we compound it over many years
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.620]   can have a very big impact.
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.920]   And so whenever you can give up taxable account money
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.120]   where you don't keep the whole rate of return
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   and in exchange get more Roth money
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.820]   where you do keep the whole rate of return,
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.220]   that's a good thing.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.220]   That's a point in favor of doing a conversion.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.920]   Now, exactly how beneficial it turns out to be,
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.320]   in other words, how big of a point
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.920]   this is in favor of a conversion,
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.720]   it varies based on the circumstances.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.720]   And the most important factor here
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.620]   is how long will the money stay in the Roth account
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.020]   after you do the conversion.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.420]   And the longer the money would be in the Roth account,
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.520]   the more beneficial this is,
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.520]   the bigger a point it is in favor of conversions.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.620]   And that just, for the very simple reason
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.520]   that the longer the money is in the Roth,
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.420]   then the more years you had to take advantage
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.820]   of tax-free compounding.
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.320]   And the length of time in question here,
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.320]   it could be from the date that you do the conversion
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.720]   until the date that you take the money out to spend it.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.320]   Or it could be from the date that you do the conversion
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.920]   until the date that the dollars are distributed
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.720]   at some point after your death to your beneficiaries.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.820]   And so under the current rules,
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.020]   if somebody inherits a Roth IRA
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.320]   from someone other than their spouse,
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.320]   they have to take the money out, but not right away.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.920]   They're allowed to keep the money in the Roth
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.020]   for up to 10 years beyond the date of death.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.020]   So for some retirees here,
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.120]   we could be talking about from the date you do the conversion
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.720]   through the rest of your life plus 10 more years.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.220]   And so your age and your health
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.620]   are really important factors in this analysis.
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.320]   The younger you are and the better health you're in,
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.520]   the more likely it is
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.520]   that we're talking about a really long time here.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.220]   And for some retirees,
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.220]   particularly those early in retirement
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.020]   and who are in good health,
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.820]   the rest of their life plus 10 years,
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.920]   it's not out of the question
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.220]   that we could be talking about 40 years,
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.320]   maybe even 50 years.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.220]   And 40 or 50 years of tax-free compounding in a Roth
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.120]   is a big deal.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.720]   This is just a very quick
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.020]   back-of-an-envelope-style math example.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.120]   If you imagine $1 invested today
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.620]   at a 4% rate of return for 40 years,
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.920]   at the end of those 40 years, it has turned into $4.80.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.320]   If you instead assume a 3.5% rate of return,
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.320]   so in other words,
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.720]   we're modeling a half-percentage point of tax drag,
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.920]   then it only turns into $3.96.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.820]   In other words, it would have been 21% more money
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.420]   in the Roth account.
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.720]   If we keep all of those inputs the same
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.520]   but crank it up to 50 years,
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.420]   now it's 27% more money in the Roth account.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.720]   And I know that the people in this room,
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.420]   most of you could do this math in a spreadsheet
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.720]   or using your favorite calculator.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.320]   So the reason I took a minute to put this in here
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.820]   is just to illustrate that this is a big deal.
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.120]   It can be very impactful.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.920]   And in some cases,
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.320]   this is actually a bigger deal
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.420]   than the pay tax now or pay tax later thing,
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.120]   even though that pay tax now or pay tax later thing
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.820]   gets all of the discussion.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.020]   In some cases, this is a bigger deal.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.520]   And frankly, what ends up happening a lot of times
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.620]   if I'm doing a Roth conversion analysis for somebody
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.220]   is when we're doing that first part,
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.220]   we're looking at pay tax now or pay tax later,
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.520]   and we're looking at the current tax rate
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.120]   and the future tax rate.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.420]   The current tax rate, we can calculate, right?
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.220]   We have at least pretty darn close.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.720]   We have the inputs that we need
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.320]   to figure out what tax rate you would pay
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.820]   on a conversion of a given size this year.
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.120]   That's easy.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.320]   We've got software that does that very quickly for us.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.820]   No big deal.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.720]   But the future tax rate,
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.420]   that is extremely uncertain
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.320]   because we don't know what investment returns
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.720]   you're going to get.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.620]   So we don't know how big your tax-deferred accounts will be,
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.220]   and so we don't know how big the RMDs will be.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.420]   And we don't know how long anyone's gonna live,
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.120]   so we don't know how long this filing status
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.520]   or that filing status applies,
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.520]   and we don't know at what point it'll be
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.220]   your beneficiaries taking money out rather than you,
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.920]   and we don't know exactly how much you're gonna spend.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.520]   So that also compounds our uncertainty
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.720]   about how big the accounts will be
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.320]   and how big the RMDs will be.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   And the big one, we don't know what tax legislation
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.620]   we're going to see.
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.020]   So that future tax rate that we're trying to compare,
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.520]   you know, current tax rate versus future tax rate,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.420]   the future tax rate is, we don't know, is the short answer.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.620]   It's extremely uncertain.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:20.720]   It's a big question mark.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.420]   And so in a lot of cases,
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.920]   if you're comparing this known future tax rate
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.020]   to an extremely uncertain,
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.320]   or known current tax rate
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.320]   to an extremely uncertain future tax rate,
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.820]   if that's the only part of the analysis that you look at,
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.120]   that can make a Roth conversion look like a wash, right?
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.520]   How would we possibly know?
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.520]   Is this good? Is it bad?
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.820]   Really hard to say.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.420]   But if we account for this other factor,
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.020]   the one on the slide,
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.820]   where you can use money from a taxable account
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.320]   to pay the tax on the conversion,
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.720]   and when you do that, you're giving up your,
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.820]   essentially your less tax-efficient dollars
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.620]   from a taxable account
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.620]   where you don't keep the whole rate of return,
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.020]   but you get more Roth dollars
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.220]   where you do get to keep the whole rate of return.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.520]   And when you account for that as well,
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.520]   in many cases, that's enough to take this analysis
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.420]   that at first glance looks like a who-knows
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.620]   and let us see that, oh, yeah, actually,
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.720]   in these circumstances,
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.620]   conversions probably are a good idea.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.420]   That's how it ends up panning out a lot of the time.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.720]   So that's our second effect of a Roth conversion.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.620]   They let you use taxable account money to pay the tax,
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.320]   and when you do that,
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.520]   you're giving up taxable account money
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.620]   and you're getting more Roth money,
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.220]   and that is a good thing.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.620]   Our third effect of a Roth conversion
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.120]   is that they will reduce your future
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.420]   required minimum distributions, your future RMDs,
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:49.520]   and that can reduce the future tax drag on the portfolio,
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.920]   and the reason that conversions reduce your future RMDs
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.820]   is very straightforward.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.420]   It's that Roth accounts don't have RMDs
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.320]   while the original owner is still alive,
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.720]   so when you do a conversion,
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.920]   you're moving money out of tax-deferred and into Roth,
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.720]   so you're just reducing the portion of your portfolio
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.120]   that is subject to RMDs, so your RMDs go down.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.520]   Now, when I say that reducing the RMDs
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.520]   can reduce the future tax drag on the portfolio,
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.620]   I want to make a distinction here
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.620]   because this is the least obvious thing
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.320]   that we're going to talk about today.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   When I say this, I'm not actually talking about the taxes
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.120]   that you would pay on the RMDs themselves.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.220]   We're not talking about that,
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.520]   and the reason we're not talking about that
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.920]   is because we already talked about it.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.920]   When we talked about the pay tax now or pay tax later,
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.320]   the pay tax later chunk of that, to a significant extent,
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.020]   that's the taxes you would pay on RMDs,
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.620]   so we've already talked about that.
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.720]   We already accounted for it.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   What we're talking about here is something completely separate.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.920]   What we're talking about here is what happens
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.220]   to any unspent RMD dollars.
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.120]   In other words, your RMDs kick in.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.920]   You take out however much you're forced to take out
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.920]   in a given year.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.720]   You spend, let's say, half of it or whatever amount.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.220]   What do you do with the rest of it?
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.120]   In a lot of cases, the answer is that the money
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.220]   is going to end up getting reinvested
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.620]   in a taxable brokerage account,
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.620]   and guess what happens in taxable brokerage accounts?
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.120]   The same thing that we were just talking about.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.220]   You have tax drag.
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.820]   You have to pay tax on the interest and dividends
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:27.220]   and capital gains when you sell stuff,
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.620]   whereas, conversely, if you do the conversion,
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.820]   then the RMD never happens, and so the tax drag
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.720]   from being in a taxable account also never happens.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.920]   The money is just allowed to stay in the Roth
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.120]   for up to the rest of your life plus up to 10 years.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.420]   Now, this is another one that isn't necessarily applicable
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:50.520]   because if you would spend your entire RMD every year
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.120]   or if you would donate any portion that you don't spend,
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.120]   if you would have it sent directly
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.120]   from your traditional IRA to charity
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.120]   as what's called a qualified charitable distribution,
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.220]   then you don't need to be worrying about this third effect.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.620]   It doesn't apply to you.
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.020]   This effect is only applicable in the cases
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.320]   where you expect that you'd be taking out your RMD
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.220]   and then ultimately reinvesting a portion of it.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.720]   That's what we're concerned with here,
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.420]   but if this does apply, if you do expect
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.420]   you would be reinvesting a portion of your RMD,
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.120]   this is another one where, by definition,
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.120]   it's a point in favor of doing conversions.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.420]   It's never a point against doing a conversion,
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.020]   but just like with effect number two,
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:33.520]   here, same thing where how beneficial it turns out to be,
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.520]   in other words, how strong a point it is
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.120]   in favor of doing a conversion
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.320]   depends on the circumstances
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.420]   and specifically it depends on how long the money
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.420]   would be in the Roth account.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.920]   Now, in this case, the, oh, and again,
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.320]   the longer it's in the Roth account,
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.820]   the more beneficial this is,
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.420]   but in this case, the length of time
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.120]   that we're concerned with, it's essentially
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.820]   how long would the money be in a taxable account,
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.320]   incurring tax drag, if you don't do the conversion,
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.420]   whereas it instead would have been in the Roth account
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.520]   if you did do the conversion.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.220]   So essentially, it starts when your RMDs start,
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.820]   which is some point in your 70s,
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.520]   depending on when you're born,
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.920]   and it goes through potentially the rest of your life
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.720]   plus up to 10 years,
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.120]   and so this is another one where your health
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.520]   is really important.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.320]   The better health you're in, the more likely it is
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.920]   that this is a long time,
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.020]   and for a lot of retirees,
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:31.320]   from the date that RMD starts, 73, 75,
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.120]   through the rest of their life plus up to 10 years,
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.020]   likely to be multiple decades,
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.420]   and multiple decades of compounding in a Roth tax-free
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.520]   can be a big deal.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.720]   So those are our three effects of a Roth conversion.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.520]   Number one, you pay tax now instead of later.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.020]   That can be good or it can be bad.
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.320]   It just depends on the tax rate you pay on the conversion,
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.620]   how that compares to the tax rate
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.120]   that would have been paid on the dollars later
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.620]   whenever they come out of the account later
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.620]   if you don't convert them.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.720]   Second effect is that conversions let you use money
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.120]   from a taxable account to pay the tax on the conversion,
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.320]   and when you do that,
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.120]   you're giving up your least tax-efficient money
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.020]   where you don't keep the whole rate of return
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.020]   and you're getting Roth money,
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.520]   which is your most tax-efficient money,
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.920]   and the third effect is that conversions
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.420]   are gonna reduce your RMDs,
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.120]   and that can reduce the future tax drag on your portfolio
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.420]   if you expect that you would be reinvesting
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.220]   your excess RMDs every year.
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:33.720]   So moving on to primary topic number two,
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.120]   what are the goals that we can hope to achieve
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.320]   with a smart conversion plan?
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.520]   Or another way to say this would be
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.520]   what are the metrics that we can realistically expect
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.120]   would be improved by doing conversions?
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.120]   And to back up just a step,
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.420]   one thing that I have found
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.320]   in doing retirement tax planning for a lot of people
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.320]   is that a tax-efficient spending plan
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:02.120]   usually improves financial security in retirement,
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.020]   and what I mean by that is that it improves two metrics.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.020]   Number one, makes it less likely
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.620]   you're gonna run out of money during your lifetime.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.420]   Number two is that it makes it so that
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.820]   in the unlucky scenarios,
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.120]   like if we're doing Monte Carlo simulations,
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.320]   in the unlucky scenarios where you still do run out of money,
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.020]   at least it happens later in life.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.620]   So that's still an improvement at least.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.020]   And so when you improve both of those two things together,
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.420]   in my head I just think of that as,
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:31.420]   okay, you're now safer, more financially secure.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.720]   Now one thing that honestly surprised me
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.820]   when I started digging into this
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.320]   is from modeling Roth conversions
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:44.020]   for a lot of clients in a very, very broad range
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.520]   of financial circumstances
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.120]   and using a bunch of different assumptions
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.520]   for all of the various inputs,
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.020]   is that Roth conversions don't usually have those effects.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.520]   They don't usually improve financial security in retirement.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.520]   And I know that surprises a lot of people,
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.520]   and in fact you're probably thinking,
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.820]   well, why the heck not?
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.120]   Because we just spent all that time
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.920]   talking about the three effects of a conversion
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.620]   and how they can be helpful.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.720]   So how can that be true and this can also be true?
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.020]   It's not very intuitive.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.120]   And the way I've come to think of it is,
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.420]   if you think about the problems that Roth conversions solve,
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.120]   number one is RMDs, right?
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.320]   They make your RMDs smaller
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.720]   and that has various beneficial effects.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.320]   And number two is the tax drag
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.520]   that occurs in taxable accounts.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.620]   Basically the two things
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.620]   I've spent the last half hour talking about.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.620]   Those are the problems Roth conversions solve.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.420]   But if we make a list,
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.720]   what are the things that are likely
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   to cause portfolio depletion in retirement?
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.120]   Those two things aren't on that list, right?
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.920]   RMDs, they don't cause people to run out of money.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.320]   If you haven't run into that math yet,
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.720]   they just don't.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.020]   In fact, RMDs are often recommended
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.020]   as a retirement spending strategy
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.120]   with the idea being look up
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.720]   whatever the RMD percentage would be
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.920]   for somebody your age
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.420]   and then spend that percent of your whole portfolio.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.820]   And they're recommended as a spending strategy
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.720]   precisely because they're so unlikely
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.220]   to cause portfolio depletion.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.820]   And that second factor there,
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.220]   the tax drag that occurs in a taxable account.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.020]   If you think about how an unlucky retirement scenario
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.120]   is likely to look,
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.720]   that problem solves itself most of the time
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.220]   because as we'll get to in just a minute,
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.020]   the first dollars that you usually spend in retirement
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.520]   are the taxable account dollars.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.520]   And so if we're thinking about
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.120]   an unlucky retirement scenario
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.620]   where the portfolio is getting depleted
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.620]   and you're spending it down rapidly,
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.120]   that's the first thing that gets spent down.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.120]   And remember, the tax drag is a small percentage.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.120]   It's only a big deal
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.820]   when we're compounding that small percentage
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.820]   over 30, 40 years of having a taxable account.
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:54.720]   If you're talking about
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.220]   maybe a half percentage point of cost
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.520]   on an account that's only a part of your portfolio
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.020]   and that account is going to disappear
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.820]   within the first maybe four or five or six years,
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.920]   half a percent on a part of the portfolio
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.820]   for a handful of years
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.220]   wasn't really the big thing that caused the depletion, right?
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.320]   So the tax drag in taxable accounts,
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.420]   it doesn't cause portfolio depletion.
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.120]   And so Roth conversions are solving problems.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.220]   They're just not the things
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.620]   that cause people to run out of money.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.820]   Now, if we think,
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:29.220]   what are the things that cause people to run out of money?
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.620]   The first one that comes to mind for me
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.020]   is sequence of returns risk.
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.420]   And I know many of you have heard that term.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.620]   The idea is if you get bad investment returns
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.920]   in your early retirement years,
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.420]   you can have this situation where the portfolio,
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.420]   if it's just getting smashed in the stock market, right,
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.620]   and you're spending from it at the same time,
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.920]   it can end up getting severely depleted really quickly.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.320]   And so even if you get good returns going forward from there,
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   it might not save the day.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.720]   And then the second thing that comes to mind for me
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.520]   is the term spending shocks.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.820]   This is a term that came from the late Dirk Cotton.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.920]   He was one of my favorite retirement writers.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.820]   If you ever get a chance, look him up.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.320]   And the idea of a spending shock
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:13.220]   is it is an unexpected but unavoidable big expense
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.320]   or a series of expenses.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.520]   So it could be a healthcare cost
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.420]   that wasn't covered by insurance
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.820]   or major house repairs or whatever it is.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.820]   And the reason those are so problematic
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.720]   is exactly the same reason
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.720]   as sequence of returns risk, actually.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.720]   If that happens early in retirement,
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.120]   you get hit with this big expense
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.320]   that you hadn't planned on and you can't avoid it,
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.020]   it can result in the portfolio getting depleted
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.620]   too severely, too rapidly.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.420]   And then even if you get good returns after that,
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.620]   it might not save the day.
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.420]   So those, in my head,
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.020]   those are the two things that are the biggest problems,
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.920]   the biggest risks,
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.920]   things that are likely to cause portfolio depletion.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   But if we think of both of those things
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.320]   and think about Roth conversions,
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.120]   Roth conversions don't solve those.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.420]   They don't make sequence of returns risk go away.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:04.120]   They don't make unavoidable healthcare expenses go away.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.120]   That's just not what Roth conversions do.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.820]   So they're helpful, but they're just not helpful in this way.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.420]   And so that might lead somebody to ask,
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.020]   "Why would I bother with a Roth conversion
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.120]   if it's not improving my financial security?
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.420]   What can I hope to get out of it?"
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.220]   And the answer is that in a case of a smart conversion plan,
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.920]   and I specify smart conversion plan
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.220]   because this is something
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.320]   that we need to be putting thought into, right?
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.020]   We don't just want to start willy-nilly Roth conversions
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.520]   because in most years for most people,
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.920]   conversions aren't a good idea.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.820]   It's just in the years where they are a good idea,
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.720]   the things that we can typically hope to see from it
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.220]   is that it's going to be increasing,
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:45.020]   improving the after-tax bequest
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.620]   that is likely to be left to heirs.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.420]   And they do that without changing financial security
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.720]   in either direction.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.120]   So one way to think of that would be conversions
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.620]   don't make the bad scenarios any better,
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:02.220]   but they also don't make them worse in a smart conversion plan.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.220]   But they do make the medium-to-good scenarios better.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:11.120]   That's typically what we can hope to get out of conversions.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.020]   And moving on to our last topic, topic number three,
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.920]   of how does a Roth conversion plan
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.320]   fit into a broader overall retirement tax plan?
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.220]   We're going to move through this a little more quickly.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.320]   And the question here is,
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.520]   which dollars do we want to spend every year?
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.220]   We can spend tax-deferred, Roth,
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.320]   or taxable dollars in every year of retirement.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.020]   And the plan that we want to follow --
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.720]   and again, this is the very brief summary --
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.320]   is that every year the first dollars we want to spend
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.620]   are the checking account dollars.
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.320]   So what I mean by that is everything in the checking account
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.020]   and all the stuff that automatically shows up
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.220]   in the checking account.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.720]   So earned income while you still have it,
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.720]   Social Security once that kicks in,
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.120]   RMDs, pension or annuity income
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.720]   if you have either of those, all those things.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   After that, we go to the savings accounts next.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.620]   And then after that, we go to the taxable brokerage accounts,
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.220]   specifically the investments in those accounts
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.320]   where you would not have to pay any tax costs
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.420]   from selling them.
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:11.320]   So things that have unrealized losses and money market funds
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.220]   where your basis is equal to the market value,
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.020]   so you can just spend it.
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.720]   That's the first stuff we want to spend every year.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.420]   And it's actually only when we've already spent
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.420]   all of those dollars and then still need to spend more,
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.620]   that's when we have to start making some hard decisions,
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.220]   making judgment calls where we weigh the pros
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.120]   and cons of our options.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:34.120]   And in most cases, the first dollars to go after next
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.620]   are actually just the other dollars in a taxable account.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.420]   In other words, the investments in a taxable account
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.420]   where you would have to pay tax if you sold them.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.520]   And the exception there is if you expect
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.920]   that you would be donating or bequeathing those assets soon.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.720]   In that case, you want to leave them alone.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.920]   And the example I always give here is
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.620]   imagine a 98-year-old retiree.
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:59.020]   And let's say she's the only person in her household.
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.020]   No matter how old we get,
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.020]   we obviously don't know how many years we have left.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.220]   But at age 98, probably fair to say that her heirs
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.720]   will be inheriting these dollars roughly soonish, right?
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.520]   Like, we don't know exactly what that means, but soonish.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:18.020]   And so let's say she has a mutual fund in a taxable account
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.020]   and she bought this mutual fund like 30 or 40 years ago.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.520]   And so it has a cost basis that's way down here
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.420]   and market value way up here.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.720]   Well, for her, if she sold that,
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.820]   she'd have to pay a capital gains tax.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.320]   And so what probably makes sense for her
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:37.120]   is to leave that appreciated taxable asset alone,
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.520]   spend from her retirement accounts,
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.720]   and then when her heirs do inherit these dollars,
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.220]   which, again, is likely to be not the terribly distant future,
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.420]   they'll get a step up in cost basis.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.120]   And so that appreciated taxable asset,
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.120]   no one had to pay tax on all of that appreciation.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.920]   But then if you flip the example around,
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.120]   now think about a couple who are early in retirement,
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.820]   age 60 and 62 or something like that.
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.920]   Statistically, they have a lot of years of retirement
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.220]   ahead of them, right?
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:08.520]   So for them, if they have a mutual fund
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.420]   in a taxable account that has a basis way down here
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.620]   and market value way up here,
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.220]   for them it probably does actually make sense
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.920]   to just bite the bullet and sell that
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:18.920]   when they need it for spending
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.420]   in order to preserve their retirement accounts.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:24.820]   Because for them, the step up in cost basis
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.320]   is probably not coming anytime soon to save the day.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.520]   So for them, we're probably selling that taxable asset first
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.020]   and preserving the retirement accounts.
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.920]   So again, just a brief summary there is the younger you are,
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.820]   the more likely it is to make sense
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.020]   to go after the appreciated taxable assets
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.120]   to preserve the retirement accounts.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.720]   And the older you are, the more likely it is to make sense
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.120]   to spend from their retirement accounts
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.620]   to preserve the appreciated taxable assets
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.820]   for the step up in cost basis.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:55.020]   Now, whenever we do have to spend from retirement accounts,
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.020]   whether we're spending from tax deferred or from Roth
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.320]   is actually just the same question
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.020]   that we're always talking about with Roth conversions.
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:05.220]   It's current marginal tax rate, future marginal tax rate,
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.720]   how do they compare?
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.120]   And whenever your current tax rate is the lower of the two,
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.820]   then we want to spend from tax deferred, right?
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.820]   Take advantage of the low tax rate.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.420]   And whenever your current tax rate is the higher of the two,
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.520]   then we spend from Roth.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.120]   Now, as you can see, this last point here,
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.020]   what we're actually getting at
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:27.320]   is how does a Roth conversion plan fit into this?
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.620]   And the idea here is that when you're following a plan
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:35.520]   like this, most likely in the early years of retirement,
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.220]   you're going to be spending those taxable assets.
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:42.320]   And so you won't be spending or maybe not spending very much
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.420]   from the tax deferred accounts.
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.720]   And so what that's going to mean is that, right,
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.320]   you've retired, so your income has gone down.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.920]   We're not spending from tax deferred yet.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.020]   Social Security probably hasn't started yet.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.320]   So you've got some years with low taxable income
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.420]   and low tax rate space available to you.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.620]   And so what we're going to do is fill up
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.620]   that low tax rate space with Roth conversions.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.120]   These two ideas, they fit hand in hand.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.220]   It's the tax-smart spending plan
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.820]   that creates the space for the Roth conversions.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.120]   They fit together.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.420]   It's one broad, integrated retirement tax plan.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:18.420]   And that's it.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.120]   So, yeah, we have about 10 minutes for questions.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:39.720]   All right, when can it be worth it
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.020]   to donate appreciated taxable assets
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:45.920]   to a donor-advised fund to reduce your tax bracket
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.120]   to enable more traditional IRA, 401(k) conversions to Roth?
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.920]   OK, so that's an interesting question.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:00.520]   And I wouldn't-- that's a very interesting question.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.920]   And there's a lot going on here.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:07.620]   So donating appreciated taxable assets,
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:13.120]   that is usually the second best way
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:17.120]   to donate once you've reached age 70 and 1/2.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.620]   Once you've reached 70 and 1/2, that's
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.520]   when QCDs, Qualified Charitable Distributions, kick in.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.520]   Most of the time, QCDs are our best way
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.920]   to be donating once you're eligible for them.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.020]   But before 70 and 1/2, your best way
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.020]   to be doing charitable giving is by donating
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.220]   appreciated taxable assets.
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.020]   And the reason that's such a good idea
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:37.920]   is that you get an itemized deduction
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.220]   for the current market value.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.120]   And you don't have to pay tax on that appreciation,
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.320]   as long as you owned the investment
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.320]   for longer than one year.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.720]   So don't forget that bit.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:51.720]   But I wouldn't necessarily say that we
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:58.320]   want to be donating just to reduce the tax bracket
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.620]   so that you can be doing Roth conversions.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:03.620]   Because in my mind, if you've got
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.720]   significant charitable intent--
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.120]   we want to be doing some donating--
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:13.120]   that itself is a strong point against the Roth conversions.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.120]   Because we can be listing the charity
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.320]   as the beneficiary of the IRA to begin with,
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.920]   or just waiting a little bit and then using QCDs.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:27.420]   So donating appreciated taxable assets makes a lot of sense.
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.620]   But I wouldn't think that that's a great motivation
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:30.320]   to be doing it.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.820]   Because if you have a lot of charitable intent,
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.520]   we probably don't necessarily want
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.820]   to be doing conversions anyway.
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:45.920]   If you max out your employer 401(k) contributions in pre-tax,
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.720]   can you still execute a backdoor Roth IRA contribution?
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.920]   Yeah, potentially.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.320]   So the big hang up there doesn't have anything--
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.820]   so backdoor Roth IRA.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.220]   That is when you earn too much to contribute
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.620]   to a Roth IRA in the normal way.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:06.020]   So you make a non-deductible traditional IRA contribution,
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.120]   and then do an immediate conversion.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.220]   The big caveat, the thing you need to look out for,
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:15.620]   is if you have other money in a traditional IRA--
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.820]   and it doesn't even have to be this traditional IRA.
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.420]   The IRS considers them all to be one IRA for this purpose.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.620]   So even if you've got some other traditional IRA,
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.520]   some other brokerage firm, that's still a problem.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.520]   Basically, in order to be doing backdoor Roth,
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:32.820]   we need to make sure that the only money in traditional IRAs
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.320]   for you-- we don't count your spouse, but for you--
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.520]   is this non-deductible contribution
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.320]   that you just made.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.620]   That's what we're looking to do.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.220]   So a lot of times, if you have traditional IRA money--
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:45.520]   and in this case, we have a 401(k) also, so that's our out--
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.220]   what we're going to do is take the traditional IRA that
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:50.520]   exists and has tax-deferred dollars,
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.720]   roll it into the 401(k).
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.420]   So now we don't have any traditional IRA anymore,
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.420]   and that frees us up to be doing non-deductible IRA
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.620]   contributions and then immediately converting them.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:05.620]   If I have more money in my traditional IRA
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.720]   than my Roth IRA, do you advocate
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.320]   chunking a portion from traditional to Roth
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.720]   over a period of several years?
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:17.120]   So it's not necessarily a function
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.120]   of exactly how big this account is
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.120]   relative to another account.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.220]   That's not usually the number one thing we're looking at.
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.620]   But because, again, we're usually
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.520]   looking at exactly the stuff we talked about--
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.920]   current tax rate, future tax rate.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.720]   And so how big the traditional IRA is certainly
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.920]   plays into that future tax rate.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.220]   But we're not necessarily looking to get--
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.720]   we're not trying to say, you should
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.420]   have 50/50 tax-deferred and Roth.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:49.320]   There's not a tax-deferred Roth allocation that is the best.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.520]   But with conversions in general, yes,
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.320]   chunking them is usually a good idea.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.620]   We don't, in most cases, want to just go whole ham
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.420]   and hit the whole IRA in one year.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.920]   Most of the time we're spreading it out over several years
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.220]   so that we can do it at lower tax rates over time.
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:05.720]   Let's see.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:12.720]   How do you decide the amount to convert in a specific year,
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.520]   for example, up to amount when next tax bracket kicks in?
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.020]   So in any given year when you're doing a conversion,
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.520]   we're picking an income threshold.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.020]   And then we're going to try to stay
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.620]   right below that threshold.
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.920]   So often, it will be we're going to the top of this tax bracket.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.920]   Or it could be right below an IRMA threshold.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.620]   Or it could be right below the phase-out for some tax credit
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.620]   or whatever.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.820]   And there isn't a rule of thumb, because there
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.920]   isn't the sort of thing where you can--
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.720]   I use software for this.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.520]   Trying to manually do it out in a spreadsheet
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.520]   is going to be bordering on impossible.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.520]   [AUDIO OUT]
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:46:01.820]   Turn this mic?
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.520]   Yeah, all right.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.120]   So there isn't--
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.620]   I'm just going to keep saying this.
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.520]   There aren't rules of thumb for a lot of this.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.920]   So we are usually going to be picking
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.320]   some particular threshold.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.620]   And usually that's-- a part of that
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:17.820]   is we're looking at the current tax rate, future tax rate idea,
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.120]   trying to get some ballpark of that future tax rate.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.520]   But sometimes, whatever we might very roughly ballpark
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.720]   that future tax rate at, it still
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.720]   often makes sense to do conversions
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.920]   slightly beyond that point.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.120]   Again, if we're using taxable account money
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.820]   to pay the tax and all that stuff.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.620]   Because that's what we're getting at here,
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:40.320]   is that there's other benefits to conversions other than just
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.520]   reducing that future tax rate.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.320]   There was another piece of this question.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.820]   Oh, one other point, by the way, is
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.320]   that sometimes it's nice, if you can,
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.720]   to pick a threshold that is not a Medicare IRMA threshold.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.620]   Because if we're picking a tax bracket threshold
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.920]   and you end up, oops, I went $1,000 over,
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:00.920]   not that big of a deal.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.620]   It means $1,000 got taxed at a couple higher percent.
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:04.620]   Not-- who cares?
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:07.720]   But accidentally going $1 over an IRMA threshold
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.220]   really is not ideal.
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.120]   So IRMA thresholds are less forgiving.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:15.820]   So that in itself is a reason to pick a different threshold.
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.620]   Because then if you mess up by a little bit,
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.420]   which does happen, because when we're doing the conversion,
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.220]   we're not usually doing it December 31st.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.520]   We're usually doing it at some point
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.920]   somewhat earlier in the year.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:28.820]   So we don't know exactly, precisely, all of the inputs.
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.520]   So it can be hard to nail it exactly.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.720]   So picking tax brackets rather than IRMA brackets
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.920]   often makes sense just because it's more forgiving.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.720]   If it makes sense to do a conversion from IRA to Roth,
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.220]   is the goal to reduce the IRA to zero
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.920]   or to some other value target?
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.920]   No.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.920]   There is no rule of thumb.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.220]   Sorry.
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:02.520]   Sometimes we want to be reducing the IRA to zero.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.120]   That's almost exclusively in cases
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.020]   where there is a big taxable account.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.020]   Because if we're reducing the IRA to zero,
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.020]   we're getting to the point where we're probably
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.120]   making that future tax rate pretty darn low.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.220]   And the only reason that we would
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.220]   have kept converting all the way to that point,
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.020]   probably paying taxes at a higher rate
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.820]   than whatever we're anticipating that future tax rate to be,
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:25.220]   the only reason we would be doing
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.820]   that is because we're just trying
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.520]   to get maximum value out of these taxable account dollars
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.020]   by just using them to pay this tax.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.620]   So some cases, yep, it makes sense
[00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:34.720]   to go all the way to zero.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.620]   But that would specifically be if we're really
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:38.520]   trying to maximize that, get the value out
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.320]   of the taxable account sort of thing.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.020]   Most of the time, we're not going
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:44.520]   to be converting the IRAs all the way to zero.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.920]   We're usually going to be picking
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.820]   some particular threshold, hitting
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.320]   that threshold every year.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.520]   And then often what ends up happening is Social Security
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.820]   kicks in, and then RMDs kick in shortly thereafter.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.620]   And there's just no more space for conversions at that point.
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.220]   So that's typically how it goes.
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:01.620]   Should you do the conversion all in one year or over time?
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:02.520]   Generally over time.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.520]   Again, it usually makes sense to break it up
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.920]   to keep your taxable income relatively lower
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.220]   than doing one big chunk and paying a huge tax
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.020]   bite all at once.
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:14.820]   If you do a conversion on January 1,
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.620]   when do you have to pay the tax?
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:22.920]   So if you have taxes withheld, the advantage of that
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:26.820]   is that whenever you do the conversion, any withholding,
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.920]   just as a rule, whether it's withholding from wages
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.720]   or withholding from a conversion or anything,
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.920]   withholding is always treated as having been paid on time.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:37.420]   Whereas if you're paying taxes separately,
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.220]   making estimated tax payments, there
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.020]   are specific deadlines for that.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:45.520]   So if you choose to have taxes withheld,
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:49.220]   no matter when you do the conversion, you're good.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.720]   But again, we don't usually want to have taxes withheld.
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.620]   Because that means we're using the IRA money.
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.520]   And most of the time, we want to be using, if we have it,
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.420]   taxable account money to pay the tax.
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:01.120]   And so in that case, we're going to be making an estimated tax
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:01.820]   payment.
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:03.920]   And estimated tax payments, there's
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.320]   four over the course of the year.
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.520]   But they're not quarterly.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.920]   They don't happen every three months.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:08.920]   If you think it's every three months,
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.420]   you're going to get one of them late.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:14.420]   So you just make estimated tax payments on time,
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.520]   is basically how it works.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.520]   Just look up the regular rules for estimated tax payments.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.620]   And it looks like we've got 20 seconds left.
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:20.520]   Let's see what this is.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:24.820]   Oof, that's not a 20 second one.
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:28.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:28.820]   Oh, OK.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.720]   I'm 62 with a number of dormant old 401(k)s kicking around
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:33.020]   from past employers.
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.120]   Convert or no?
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:39.920]   Well, so likely, it makes sense to be moving those,
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.420]   just for simplicity's sake, all into one account,
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:47.120]   whether that's into an IRA or into your current 401(k).
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.420]   That's usually what makes sense.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:52.020]   That's separate from the conversion idea.
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:54.920]   This factor, having a whole bunch of different 401(k)s,
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.420]   not really a factor in the Roth conversion analysis, right?
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.720]   All the things we talked about--
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.520]   current tax rate, future tax rate--
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.220]   they're based on dollar amounts rather than number of accounts.
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.320]   So all the same stuff we said, it's the same,
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.020]   even if you have a bunch of old 401(k)s.
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:10.520]   But if you do have a bunch of old 401(k)s,
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.420]   it's probably time to do something about that.
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:14.920]   So I think that's it, right?
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.920]   We're over time by a minute and a half now.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.980]   you
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.040]   you
