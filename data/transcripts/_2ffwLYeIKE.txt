[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   Today, we have a Bible translation question from a listener named Brian.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.720]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.120]   I am grateful to God for your ministry and for this podcast, and I'm grateful for your
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.480]   commitment to accurate Bible translations.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.680]   Speaking of translations, I have noticed that the ESV's Old Testament has 103 mentions
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.520]   of atone or atonement, but the ESV's New Testament doesn't contain any mention of
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.440]   atone or atonement.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.040]   Is that because the Hebrew word kephar means "to cover," and Christ's death and resurrection
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.200]   actually erases or forgives our sins rather than merely covering our sins?
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.560]   Pastor John, what am I missing here?"
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.520]   Well, this is fascinating.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.320]   I at first thought, "Oh my goodness, I don't know what to say about this," and the more
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.000]   I got into it, the more interesting it became.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.760]   So, it's a little bit of heavy sledding, but hang on, I think you'll find it interesting.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:09.480]   The English word atonement originally meant "at onement"—spell the same, "at hyphen
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.320]   onement"—and referred to any reconciliation of estranged parties.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.800]   It wasn't originally just a theological or biblical word.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.640]   For example, when Thomas More said in 1535—I got this from the Oxford English Dictionary—"Having
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.280]   more regard to their old variance than their new atonement," or atonement, that is, unity,
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.960]   reconciliation, oneness.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:44.360]   But as time passed, the English word atonement became almost entirely a theological word
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.560]   referring very generally to the way the broken relationship between God and man could be
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.640]   made right.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:01.280]   So the Oxford English Dictionary says, "As applied to the redemptive work of Christ,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.560]   atonement is variously used by theologians in the sense of reconciliation, propitiation,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.560]   expiation."
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.820]   In fact, this is very significant.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:24.280]   In Leon Morris's book titled The Atonement, which I recommend, he has a chapter on redemption,
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:32.880]   reconciliation, propitiation, justification, because all these are different ways of describing
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:41.840]   how God in Christ overcame the broken relationship between God and man.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:51.620]   The word atonement occurs in the ESV Old Testament 102 times, or 103, I guess, depending on how
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.000]   you count it.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.360]   In every one of those cases, it is translating some form of the Hebrew word kephar.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:10.760]   That word originally meant "cover," but just like the English word atonement, it seems
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.400]   to have become almost a technical word, not for covering anything in general, but for
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.040]   covering sin in particular, that is, removing it and restoring the broken relationship between
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040]   God and man.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.360]   And we can see this, this peculiar theological orientation for the word kephar.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:39.760]   We can see this by noticing that in the Greek Old Testament, the word kephar in Hebrew is
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.880]   virtually always translated not by any ordinary Greek word for cover like kalupto, but almost
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.840]   always, like over 100 times, translated with exhilaskamai, which doesn't mean cover at
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.960]   all.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.760]   It means appease or to reconcile.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:10.440]   So it's pretty clear that kephar was not a word used in biblical times for just any old
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.240]   covering, but for the covering of sin, precisely in the sense of doing away with it or removing
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:25.200]   it so that the relationship between God and man could be made right.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   Which brings us now to Brian's question.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.400]   Since the word atonement is used over 100 times in the English Old Testament—and by
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.480]   the way, it's not just the ESV.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.400]   This is true right across the board in English translations, that the ESV, King James Version,
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.520]   why is it never used in the English New Testament?
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.520]   Virtually never.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.520]   ESV, never.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.120]   And the others, maybe one or two times.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.920]   It's still the same question.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.800]   It's not just an interesting question about the English word for atonement and why it
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.540]   doesn't occur in the New Testament.
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:06.560]   It's also a question why the Greek translation of kephar, namely exhilaskamai, never occurs
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.320]   in the New Testament.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.020]   That's even more provocative.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:19.240]   It's as though the New Testament writers steered clear of all the kephar associations, both
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:27.000]   Hebrew and Greek, and so the English translators are perfectly justified in not using the English
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.400]   word atonement at all in the New Testament.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.640]   So there's no Greek word for kephar in the Greek New Testament, and there's no English
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.520]   word for kephar in the English New Testament.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   Amazing.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.520]   Why is that?
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.520]   That's Brian's question.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.880]   Why is that?
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.520]   And I think Brian's suggestion is on the right track.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.000]   He asks, "Is it because the Hebrew word kephar means 'to cover,' and Christ's death and
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.360]   resurrection actually erases or forgives our sins rather than merely covering our sins?"
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.880]   Now, I wouldn't want to say that kephar in the Old Testament only meant cover and not
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.880]   put away.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.120]   I don't think that's the case, but I think you're on the right track.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.880]   Maybe more generally, we should say this.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:26.280]   The achievement of Christ in his death so utterly outstripped anything referred to by
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.640]   the kephar word group in the Old Testament that the New Testament writers didn't want
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.480]   to use words with that kind of association or limitation.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.280]   But here's another way to say it, maybe.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.200]   It's not just that the New Testament writers wanted to avoid the inadequate connotations
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.800]   of kephar in the Old Testament.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:57.180]   I think, and this is more important, they wanted to celebrate with greater specificity
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:04.960]   and fullness what actually happened in the death of Jesus in dealing with sin rather
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.760]   than just over and over again using a word like "he covered it, he covered it, he covered
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.760]   it."
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.440]   I'll give you an example so you can see what I mean by this amazing variety of specificity
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.720]   they wanted to celebrate.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.840]   They used the word "lutrao" to draw out the ransom, Mark 10, 41.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.080]   They used the word "apolytrosis" to get at the meaning of redemption, Ephesians 1,
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.080]   7.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.720]   They used the word "hilasterion" to draw out propitiation, Romans 3, 25.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.800]   They used the word "katalaso" to draw out the meaning of reconciliation, Romans 5,
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   10.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.440]   They used the word "katharismos" to draw out the meaning of purification for sins,
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.960]   Hebrews 1, 3.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.360]   They used "pharaoh" and "thusios" to show Christ's offering of himself as a
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.580]   sacrifice, Hebrews 7, 27.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:05.680]   They used "aphireo" and "peri-ireo" to refer to taking away sins, Hebrews 10, 4.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.440]   They used "dikaiao" to get at justification, Romans 5, 9.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.920]   They used "sozo" to get at simply saving us from our sins, Matthew 1, 21.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:24.280]   And sometimes they simply stated the fact Jesus died and then made the connection with
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.340]   the removal of God's wrath, like 1 Thessalonians 5, 9.
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:36.880]   God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus, who
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:42.520]   died for us, so that whether we wake or sleep, we might live with him.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.040]   So the point there is not to give it any particular name at all, just to say he died, and that's
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.040]   why there's no wrath against us anymore.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:57.820]   So yes, Brian, I think you're right that the kaphar idea, the atonement idea of the
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:05.320]   Old Testament, is inadequate to describe what Christ accomplished when he shed his blood.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:12.360]   And I only want to add to your explanation that the New Testament writers were eager
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:20.880]   to tell us more about how God saved us through the death of Jesus than any one word could
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.920]   ever have told us.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:31.340]   And I would encourage every Christian to study and meditate on the wonder and the variety
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:37.720]   of the words that the New Testament uses to describe the greatest of all events in history,
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.880]   the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.600]   You won't regret it.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.000]   No, you sure won't.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   That is glorious.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.280]   And a very interesting investigation indeed.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.520]   Thank you, Pastor John, for chasing all of this down for us.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.600]   And thank you for listening.

[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:17.840]   While on this podcast, we frequently return to fundamental realities, essential truths,
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.420]   the things that are most precious to us, things like the glory of God and the cross of Jesus
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.560]   Christ.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.680]   We return to them because if you get the fundamentals right, everything else eventually falls into
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.680]   place.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.360]   But if you get the fundamentals wrong, nothing will fall exactly into place and something
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.040]   will always be off.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.040]   So next time, we return to the fundamentals and ask, "Why in the first place do I need
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.160]   to be saved?
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.160]   What is my problem?
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:51.960]   And how do God, and specifically Christ, fit into the equation of how I am delivered?"
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.960]   It's really important.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   I hope you join us.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   I'm Tony Renke.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
