[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.620]   host and today I am going to share with you yet another of the many things that over time
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.100]   I have realized I was wrong about previously. And today's topic is specifically the topic
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.680]   of having and maintaining a vacation home. Now, thankfully this one is more of one of
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.420]   those intellectual "I was wrong, I didn't understand previously" rather than having
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.900]   had a big impact on me. But it has affected my own personal goals. And let me tell you
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.860]   very quickly what I mean. When I was younger, I observed that many people had vacation homes.
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.180]   From time to time, I was fortunate enough to be invited to the vacation homes of some
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.460]   of my friends. My family, personally, we never had a vacation home. We were not at that level
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.980]   of economic existence. But I was fortunate to be invited from time to time to a few of
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.300]   my friends' vacation homes. And in that process, I thought about vacation homes. I
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.260]   thought about money and my own goals and things like that. And I asked myself, "Would I
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:56.340]   want to have a vacation home?" And I came to the very clear opinion that I would not
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.100]   want to have a vacation home. I still remember an anecdote that I read in some random book
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.940]   talking about money and stuff, etc. And who knows, perhaps it was an apocryphal story
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:16.900]   or if it was exactly cited. I simply don't know. But the guy was a wealthy guy. It was
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.980]   a Friday afternoon. He was a wealthy guy. He was getting ready to board an airplane,
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.740]   maybe his private jet, to rush down to Florida where he was having a home built in Florida.
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.020]   And he was really stressed out. He's on the phone with his architect. And somebody
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.540]   asked him, "Why are you doing it? Why do you need this home in Florida?" And he was
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.100]   about to lose his whole weekend running down to take care of this home in Florida, this
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.940]   great nice home, but he's about to lose his whole weekend doing that. And that story
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.540]   resonated with me even from a young age. It resonated still more deeply with me when I
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.500]   add two additional facts. Fact number one is I have a tendency to appreciate the simplicity
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.180]   of minimalism. I've over the years found that the less stuff that I have, the less
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.620]   cluttered my life feels, and the more I appreciate minimalism. I've purchased various knick-knacks
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.380]   over the years. At this point, I've gotten rid of virtually all the knick-knacks, even
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.900]   the nice ones that I bought on my travels, and I haven't missed most of those things.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.220]   I don't have a lot of fancy stuff. And I think always about the costs of money and
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.140]   time that are embedded in stuff. Usually it comes down to the time. For example, there
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.380]   was a time a few years ago I had something like five cars or five vehicles with engines
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.420]   in them, and I was just annoyed at how much time I was needing to go and take those vehicles
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.820]   to a mechanic. And I thought, "Man, I don't want to have these cars anymore," not because
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.420]   I can't afford them, not because they're too expensive, but I don't like dealing with
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.980]   the time of taking them to the mechanic and getting them fixed and waiting and working
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.980]   out all the stuff. It just really is annoying to me. And then a number of years later, I
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.860]   was down to one car, and I thought, "This is great. I just have one car to take care
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.020]   of. This is wonderful." Big fan of this because of the time that it freed up.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.780]   So I've appreciated minimalism, and when you apply that concept of minimalism to even your
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.140]   own housing, you think, "Do I really want to deal with another house?" And that leads
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.020]   me to the second fact, that I don't personally enjoy dealing with most of the things that
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.660]   are required to keep up real estate. I find it annoying and frustrating, and I would prefer
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.580]   not to have much to do with it. I like to rent so that I can outsource some of the hassle
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.660]   of that. If I can find a reasonable rental cost and if I can find a suitable property,
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.580]   I would just assume rent most of that stuff rather than actually own the real estate.
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.220]   So when you put these things together, you can see why I was pretty well persuaded that
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:55.980]   I would not want to have a vacation home because of the hassle of simply having it. In addition,
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:03.440]   I am one who enjoys new things. I have a strong desire for novelty, new things, experiencing
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.300]   new things, seeing new things. I often feel quite alive when I'm in the middle of experiencing
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.860]   new things. And so it's this continual experience of new things that for me is very motivating.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.660]   And I thought, why would I ever want to go to the same place twice? I'm not one who
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.740]   looks forward to going to the same place. If I've been to a city pretty much, well,
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.580]   that's nice, right? At least a few years can pass and then I'll go back. But most
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.540]   of the time, especially within a US-American context where it doesn't have that same
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:40.220]   flair of the exotic that I often enjoy the most myself, I think, why would I want to
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.060]   go back? I've been to St. Louis, Missouri. Why would I want to go back? I've been to
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.940]   insert any city. I just make it up a random middle of the country city. I don't need
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.460]   to go back. I don't want to go back. It doesn't thrill me with any particular joy
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.580]   at the thought of going back. And so I imposed that same thinking onto a vacation property.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.740]   I thought, why would I want to have a vacation property that I'd have to go back to every
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.860]   single year? It's the same property in the same town and everything's always the same,
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.940]   the same, the same, the same, the same. Now, when you combine the financial analysis, the
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:26.020]   time analysis, and the sameness analysis, I think you come up with a pretty good argument,
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.700]   which is, again, what I previously believed. I previously thought to myself, well, listen,
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.820]   let's calculate how much the pure costs are of keeping a home. Ignore any kind of
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.780]   investment value. Let's say you buy a beach house for X number of dollars, and then you
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.540]   take a percentage of that for pure maintenance costs, double it if it's a beach house,
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.980]   to deal with salt corrosion, all of that. That's what your carrying costs are going
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:55.580]   to be, insurance, additional liability, etc. Do I really want that? And I compare that
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:02.620]   against, hey, let's go on vacation. Let's go to a new hotel, and a new town, a new resort.
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.420]   You don't have to maintain anything. The whole hotel has a staff full of people that
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.460]   maintain everything, and you just show up, and you get your room, and you do your thing,
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.700]   and you go. And next year, you can try a different place. And so then, in addition to the fun
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:21.660]   of whatever the activity it is, be it hanging out on the beach, or be it playing around
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:27.780]   on the golf course, or whatever the actual activity is, you get to enjoy the fun of the
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.660]   activity, plus the fun and the novelty of exploring new places, trying new restaurants,
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:39.100]   trying new things, etc. And so I was pretty well convinced that for me, a vacation home
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:46.020]   is not something that I have ever aspired to have. I would just as soon have a home,
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:53.020]   and I would just as soon go to a nice hotel, nice resort, nice rental house, etc. So what's
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:08:00.860]   changed? What's changed has been watching the world through the eyes of children, and
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:10.700]   thinking more about legacy, and thinking more about relationships. And there are two things
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:16.900]   that I want to share with you about, because these are the two things that I previously
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:23.660]   didn't have the maturity or the experience to actually appreciate. And these are the
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:29.540]   big benefits of vacation homes, as far as I'm concerned, and they are the things that
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:36.540]   have convinced me that in the future, I do desire to have a specific vacation home, even
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:43.380]   with all of the disadvantages that I've just outlined. Here they are.
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:50.380]   Number one, let's talk about children. I'm unconvinced that children "need" a stable
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:58.580]   environment. Many people look at the way that my family has lived our lives, and they think,
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:05.020]   "Man, your children must be totally unstable. After all, especially over the last few years,
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:11.540]   you've basically been traveling constantly, and that must be so disorienting, and it must
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:16.300]   be so destabilizing to your children." I've thought a lot about that. I've studied carefully
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:21.180]   to ask myself, "Is that happening? Is that true?" because certainly it can be.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:28.180]   The conclusion that I have drawn, at least thus far, is that even though our outward
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:34.180]   circumstances have changed, where we live, where we sleep, etc., has changed, I think
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:41.180]   that my children are not experiencing a sense of instability. And that's because our family
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:47.820]   schedule really doesn't change. When we were living in an RV, this was most pronounced,
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:54.480]   where we never knew where we would be parked on any particular night. I didn't plan very
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.300]   far ahead. We might wake up in a beautiful park in the middle of the Rocky Mountains,
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.800]   and we might wake up in a Walmart parking lot. And yet, we pretty much had the same routine
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.700]   every day. My children had breakfast with their parents at the same table every single
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:16.620]   day, with a very small number of prospective dishes that they were going to be enjoying.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:23.520]   We have meals together three times a day as a family. We have our routines. They're sleeping
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:30.520]   in the same bed, the same place, every single day. And so I concluded that things were pretty
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.860]   stable, even though what was outside of the windows was changing, and the particular people
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:40.260]   may have been changing. Even when we moved to full-time travel, living in hotels and
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:46.620]   Airbnbs, I became convinced that they're not experiencing any kind of major instability
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.860]   because our lives are so stable in terms of the relationships, the routines, etc. We do
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.620]   the same thing. And just because we happen to be in a different hotel room or a different
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:02.620]   house, that doesn't – I haven't observed any negative damaging effects to my children.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.780]   If I observed any kind of deleterious effects, I would immediately change. But I haven't
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:15.780]   observed that. But what I have come to appreciate is that children gain a deeper sense of meaning
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:22.240]   when there is a consistency to a place. And of course, I would have acknowledged that
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.060]   intellectually before, but I guess I didn't see it as being the most important thing until
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:33.740]   I started to observe some changes that happened in my own family's life, meaning that of
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:38.580]   my parents and my siblings. When I was younger, my parents had built a large house to be able
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:45.580]   to house together their large family, and that was a stable point of connection in our
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:53.880]   family for a significant amount of time. Then as my parents grew older and their children
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:12:00.620]   moved out, my parents' parents died, and once my parents' parents died, my parents
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:05.340]   didn't have the need for that same large house that they had built, and the house itself
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:10.420]   was quite a burden to clean, to care for, etc. And so they sold it and they downsized
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:15.500]   into a small condo. And that was a great blessing in the lives of my parents that I observed.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:21.620]   It freed them up from the hassle of maintaining the house, and I thought it would be totally
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:27.060]   fine because after all, in my family, we have good relationships, stable relationships.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.940]   I thought no problem at all. But then over the coming years, I watched how it was more
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:38.580]   and more difficult for us to get all of my siblings together, all of my nieces and nephews
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:45.580]   together, and we had to work extra hard to make it happen. And because we lost that natural
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:53.020]   anchoring point in our family, we started to suffer some missed opportunities to be
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:58.020]   together, because it was no longer assumed where we would be for a holiday. It was no
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:03.540]   longer assumed where we would get together. Rather, we had to figure it out. And it's
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.580]   not been all bad. We've worked at it from time to time. We've rented large houses where
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.820]   we could stay together. We've rented multiple houses in the same place. And so we've made
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:19.660]   it work. But I underestimated, when my parents sold the property, I underestimated the long-term
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:26.540]   effects. And that really made me think about my own children and my own family. And I thought,
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:33.540]   you know what? I don't want that to happen. I want to make sure that we are investing
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:41.060]   our money into the kind of family culture that will endure the test of time.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:48.220]   Now, for me, this comes out of one of those key cornerstone Christian beliefs with regard
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.940]   to money upon which I build my life. And it comes from where Jesus says, "Do not lay
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:57.220]   up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.700]   in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.420]   and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:10.220]   will be also." And over the years, as I've pondered and pondered and pondered that within
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:16.260]   our context, I became convinced that the way that you lay up treasures in heaven is by
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:23.260]   investing your money into the beings that are in heaven, which is people. And so anytime
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:31.060]   you can spend money on people, that's the way that you lay up treasures in heaven rather
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.660]   than laying up treasures in earth where you're investing not into people. And that's brought
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:41.300]   me a place of peace and a place of clarity to say, "Can I invest money into people?"
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.220]   And of course, who are the people where I begin? People that I begin are those with
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:51.380]   whom I have the most contact, those of my immediate family. A man does not care for
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.180]   his own family and especially those of his own household. He is worse than an unbeliever.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:00.820]   There's another Bible verse. And so you begin with investing into your own children, your
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.420]   own siblings, your own parents, and then it extends out from that. Now there are many
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.360]   different ways that you can do that, but as you think about the context of a family and
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.760]   building a family culture that will endure the test of time, I thought, "How can you
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:20.060]   invest money into people?" And I become convinced one of the ways that you can do it is investing
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:25.340]   it into a family culture. And if you're going to build an enduring family culture, you need
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:32.620]   to have routines, you need to have customs, you need to have memories. And as I've grown
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.860]   older and observed more, I realized how important this sense of familiarity is. And I thought
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:47.340]   back to other people who had vacation houses and I saw how it affected them. For example,
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:53.060]   many years ago I was very fortunate to be invited to a friend's vacation home for a
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:59.620]   Fourth of July weekend. And this particular home was a beautiful lake home on just a phenomenal
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:05.820]   lake in Alabama. And I went there and we had a wonderful weekend together. Spent the entire
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:11.340]   weekend hanging out. The entire family was together. We spent all day on the boats. There
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.900]   were boats, there were jet skis, there were toys, there was swimming, there was eating,
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.140]   there was drinking, there was making merry. It was a wonderful weekend enjoying all of
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.980]   the Fourth of July festivities. It was so fun. I only went one year, but my friends,
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.020]   they used that vacation home and every single year that was where you were. And it gave
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.800]   an anchoring point that from time to time the children were able to invite their friends
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:42.140]   and there would be a big party and it was just a wonderful event. And that home, the
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:48.180]   patriarch of that family, he had designated, he died quite young, he had designated that
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:54.300]   this home was going to be a part of the family's inheritance. And he had designated the home
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.940]   to be held in a trust. There was money to take care of the home, etc. Well, the heirs
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:03.500]   had the right to sell it and they went on to sell it. But then I observed from, not
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.900]   from close, but I observed that they're facing the same problems now that my family
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:12.300]   has faced of not being able to get everyone together as consistently. And now they've
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:17.100]   lost that corner point. They've lost that, "Oh, this is the rock that so-and-so jumped
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.940]   off of and broke his ankle." Or, "Oh, look, do you remember that one time that so-and-so
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.300]   got drunk and fell off the end of the dock and we had to go pull him out of the water?"
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.640]   And all those stories that every single year you tell the same story again and again and
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.460]   again and again and again and it becomes part of the family culture. And I thought about
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:39.060]   that, I thought, "That's what's needed. That's what's needed is to have that consistency."
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:46.780]   And that consistency of place and family tradition and culture makes it easier to keep a family
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:53.460]   together especially as you are going through those times of transition, especially as you're
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:58.180]   going through that period where your 22-year-old says, "Well, maybe this year I don't really
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:03.960]   want to go home for Fourth of July. Maybe I want to go to Europe for Fourth of July."
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.100]   But if they know, "You know what? No, we always do Fourth of July and it's always a great
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.580]   time and my parents expect me to do Fourth of July and we've got the house for it," then
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.900]   it creates a stronger pool and more of a desire to do that.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.740]   And so in terms of building a culture and then having that culture extend through time,
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.500]   right? So if you imagine a wonderful lake house with all of the toys that make a lake
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:33.540]   house great and then you think about the generations growing and even if it's somewhat difficult
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:38.860]   as grandchildren come along and the family expands out, you still by having that anchoring
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:45.660]   place you have a commitment to a place. And I think this also facilitates closer relationships.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:52.620]   For example, let's say that you bought a rather modest home and then your family grew and
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.700]   you might figure out, "Well, how could we add more space to the home?" But if everyone's
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:02.740]   accustomed to the fact that we stay in this home on the lake for Fourth of July weekend
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:09.780]   or we stay at this home in this ski town and that's where we do Christmas, then what happens
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.500]   is when families as families age, then it's expected that you're going to be in the home.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.520]   And even if the home is too small, you're still forced into closer contact which makes
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:25.860]   for richer family relationships. As we grow, we like to appreciate our privacy more and
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.420]   more. We don't want to necessarily be on top of each other.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.740]   And so if you think about doing the resort thing, what happens? Well, you get together
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:39.340]   in a resort and then you get together for a nice dinner. But of course, dinner has to
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.620]   be this planned affair to get 30 people together for dinner because we have to make a reservation
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:49.580]   at the restaurant. It's also intense because of the expense of it. We might have a great
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:54.780]   long dinner, but then everyone retires to their individual rooms where you don't have
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.460]   that same feel that you have in a home. Whereas if you have your own property, then yes, there's
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.660]   preparing dinner, being together, then there's dinner, and then there's some people retire
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.540]   to the rooms, but there's still the opportunities for those serendipitous encounters in the
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:12.960]   center of the home. And so having the house actually facilitates a sense of closeness
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.180]   even as your family grows and even as people get to that point where they'd like to have
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.700]   more privacy. But hey, you know what? Cousin John is sleeping on the couch in the living
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.420]   room because we're just out of beds and the little kids are in a tent in the backyard
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:30.220]   because we're out of beds and we parked an RV in the driveway to have a few more beds
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:36.100]   for such and such a family, but it's still more fun because it's a little bit of camp
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:42.780]   and it leads to those relationships. And those difficulties, even when there are difficulties,
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.100]   those difficulties are things that forge friendships at a deeper level, that forge relationships
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:52.380]   at a deeper level. If you think about the friends that you are the closest to emotionally,
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:59.260]   very frequently they will be friends with whom you have passed through trial or difficulty
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:07.100]   or discomfort. And so avoiding discomfort or trial or difficulty is not always the optimal
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:14.860]   experience. You often don't actually get close to somebody until you have passed through
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:21.580]   difficulty. So whether that difficulty is pledging in your local sorority or an absolutely
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:26.420]   catastrophic backpacking trip or going to war together and fighting in the trenches
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:32.140]   beside each other or starting a business together and failing constantly, those are the things
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:37.500]   that forge the relationships that endure the test of time. And they're not, meaning those
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.060]   are the relationships which when they have that emotional weight, they forge the test
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.900]   of time. And then so stories of difficulty that actually lend a little bit of zest to
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.420]   life. When we think about, oh, you remember that one time where we just had that awful
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.780]   experience and we showed up at the hostel at 2 a.m. and they didn't have a single bed
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:58.380]   and we had to hike an hour and sleep at the train station or we went camping and we were
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:02.540]   stuck in the rain for, I woke up and there was two inches of water in the tent. It was
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:07.180]   the most miserable night of my life and you were there with me with that wasn't that great.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:12.300]   That builds those deeper relationships. And so even a simple vacation home where there's
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:17.060]   a consistency to it can be really, really helpful in terms of perpetuating a family
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:24.180]   culture. And I see this very clearly as children reach teenage years, young adults, they start
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:30.100]   to have boyfriends, girlfriends, marry off, have children, etc. Having the consistency
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:36.700]   of a specific place that we go, I now see as something very valuable that I personally
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:43.880]   wish to facilitate. And I think it's quite doable. Consider that with regard to your
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:50.820]   own children. Consider how can I build a family culture. I would note having a vacation home
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:58.460]   is not the only way to do it. It's just, I think, a good way for those who decide to
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:05.940]   do it. And I think that this is accessible to most people if you plan a little bit. You
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:12.300]   don't have to be crazy rich, just plan a little bit. Put very simply, imagine that you buy
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:20.740]   a home as a young married couple and you pay that home on a 15-year payment schedule. You
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:25.820]   have a child after being in that home three years. And then when your oldest child is
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:31.980]   the age of 12, your mortgage is paid off. Well, go ahead and buy the vacation home in
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.500]   the place that your 12-year-old is going to really enjoy. Make sure you have the money
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:41.360]   for the toys. Make sure you have the money for the jet skis or the boats or the fishing
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.540]   gear or the things that are going to make a home actually worthwhile and stock the home
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:49.020]   with that stuff. So don't spend it all on a house and then sit there wondering, "Oh,
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:53.460]   what are we going to do? Let's play video games." Stock the home with the stuff of adventure.
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:58.660]   Make sure it's got all the toys that will lead to people having things to do, lots of
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.700]   things to do so they'll even look forward more and more to going there. But go ahead
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:07.780]   and buy the home. Take out another mortgage, pay that one, and just imagine, pay that one
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:13.080]   on a 20-year schedule, and by the time the grandchildren are coming along, that house
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:18.940]   itself will be totally paid for. So it's doable even on a modest budget. You don't need to
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:24.060]   be very, very wealthy to do it, but I think that this is a very valuable touchpoint in
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.560]   a family culture.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:31.820]   And I think that one of the things that inspired me on this was some months ago, or gave me
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.400]   a new thought, a listener gave me a new thought. Some months ago, there was a listener who
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:41.080]   called into a Friday Q&A show, and the listener made the comment, he said, "We've decided
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:47.860]   to buy the vacation home first." I had never thought of that. And the basic idea was, we're
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:52.120]   buying a home, we've got young children, we're buying a home that we think will be our long-term
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.720]   vacation home that we'll be in, but it's not the kind of home that we'll necessarily want
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.480]   to raise a 10-year-old in. It's too remote, it's too resort-towny, it doesn't have the
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.580]   things that you might be looking for for a 10-year-old or 12-year-old, so we're buying
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.820]   the vacation home, and then in a few years, we're going to go ahead and buy the in-town
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.320]   home that's closer to the amenities. And what do you think about that? I had never thought
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.340]   of it before that caller said it, but as I thought about it, I thought, "That's actually
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:22.580]   a cool idea. Very, very true, very cool idea." And what I would point out is that you might
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:28.860]   consider making the vacation home the permanent home, the thing that you own, and then you
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:34.200]   just simply adjust your other home, your primary home, so to speak, in the way that is appropriate
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:41.320]   to you at that time. If my parents had had and maintained a vacation home, and that was
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:47.620]   where we as a family celebrated the holidays, they could have simply maintained that vacation
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.680]   home even if they sold their big daily home and moved into a smaller condo, and that would
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:58.220]   have helped the family to facilitate this sense of togetherness. And remember that,
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.360]   especially if you are the parent, especially if you have the money, this is one of those
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:07.300]   ways in which you can invest your money into helping your family stay together at that
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:13.100]   time where it's difficult. Your children don't need your money when you're dead and
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:18.780]   gone. They don't need it then. If you have children when you're 25 and then you die
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:26.140]   at the age of 90, well, if you die at the age of 90, your child that you had at 25,
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:30.540]   as I stalled to do the mental math, will be 65. That's not the time when your child needs
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:35.940]   the money. So the time that your child needs the money is, of course, in the teenage years
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:48.400]   when you can give your child a richness of experience in order to enjoy and have those
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.480]   memories of a teenage year that help them as that child is going through the process
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:59.820]   of establishing his own identity. The time when your 25-year-old child needs your money
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:06.700]   is when he can just show up with his children to your vacation home and you cover everything.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:11.600]   You cover the house, you don't charge him rent, you cover the food, you cover the gas
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.380]   for the boat, you cover the boat, etc. That child may not be in the position at the moment,
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:20.900]   nor would it be wise for him to go and spend all the money on the resort fees, but if you
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:25.820]   can cover that, that's a really nice time to have it. And so don't hoard your money
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.560]   with the goal of setting it aside and leaving it to your children when you're dead. Spend
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.500]   your money on your children and invest it into them at a time when you can enjoy it
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:40.980]   with them rather than setting the goal of simply dying with the most money.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.460]   The next thing I want to point out is related to children, but it will lead me to my other
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:52.300]   point with regard to people. One of the things that I have become convinced of, also different
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:57.220]   from when I was younger, is I've become convinced in the idea that I want to spend
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:04.940]   my money to have the go-to home for my children. Of course, all of us who are parents, we care
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:10.500]   about our children and we want the best for our children. We want to be in a warm, safe,
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.320]   happy, loving environment and we want them to have rich relationships with other children.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.420]   But we want those relationships and activities to happen in an environment where we can do
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.820]   our very best to make sure that there are age-appropriate activities happening and do
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:30.280]   our very best in an environment where we can make sure that they are safe and that others
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:36.500]   are safe. And while all of us as parents who are listening to this show have that as a
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.980]   goal, we all know that not all parents have the same dedication. And so we're always
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:46.740]   careful with how do we arrange things and how do we set things properly.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:54.500]   Well, one of the things I've become convinced of is I want my home to be the center, to
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:29:03.260]   be very attractive so that it will be a great place for my children to have social enjoyment
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:07.740]   and social engagements with their peers. And so in order to do that, I'm going to spend
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:13.000]   my money to have a home that is attractive to children. And it means that I might do
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.740]   things that I might otherwise – I'll spend money on things that I might not otherwise
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:22.700]   value. I don't want my home to be a sterile environment. Obviously, I'm not this. But
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:27.300]   I don't want my house just to have a library. And look, we have thousands of books. And
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:32.820]   young children, would you not like to come over to our home and read our thousands of
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:38.820]   books? That's not particularly attractive when your 14-year-old wants to hang out with
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:44.280]   his 14-year-old buddies. And so I'm happy to say, "Let's have whatever the gaming
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.880]   thing is at that time. Let's make sure we have the environment. Let's make sure we
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:54.340]   have the toys." Well, an extension of that is often – or an extension of that idea,
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:30:00.180]   that idea of having your home be an attractive place for children and young adults so that
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:05.640]   those – so you can support your children and your young adults' social lives and
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.720]   also help to make sure that there is a warm, safe environment for your children and for
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   others where there are good standards, good protection for the children in an age-appropriate
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.440]   way, and that rules are properly enforced so that everybody can have a great time, but
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:24.720]   everybody can be safe. And I see this as an extension of investing into people as well.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.480]   The vacation home can also facilitate this. The vacation home can facilitate this to a
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:35.840]   higher degree. As you reach those times in which – especially with young adults, where
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.960]   it may be more appropriate for your young adult children to invite some of their young
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:47.400]   adult friends for a weekend, a special event at your home – you can help to facilitate
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:53.760]   that and also help to make sure that you protect them during what are often vulnerable times.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.540]   Vulnerable times when young adults do foolish things that alter the courses of their lives.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:04.880]   You can help to make sure that you facilitate their social lives, them being able to have
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.000]   friends and have time with their friends, and then you can help to make sure that it's
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.820]   genuinely productive. Back to kind of toys and whatnot. If you invest in, say, a great
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:20.800]   set of stand-up paddle boards that are hanging in your garage at your lake house, you're
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:27.200]   going to be able to facilitate a far more meaningful sense of personal interaction for
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:33.160]   your children by simply investing in that equipment. With their friends, I mean. It's
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.960]   one thing for your friends to go to somebody's house who has a TV and we can sit and watch
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.840]   a movie together. That's fine. I think we've all done that and enjoyed sitting and watching
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:46.120]   a movie together. But if you want to facilitate conversation and connection and meaningful
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:51.800]   interaction for your children so that they can have those deeper relationships with their
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.260]   friends, you're going to need to spend some money on some stuff, and that stuff will have
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:01.780]   to be strategically chosen stuff that enhances conversation. So it might be a really nice
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:08.840]   fire pit out on the lake shore. It might be a nice set of kayaks to go and kayak the mangroves.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:14.960]   It might be a great set of extra skis and snowboards so that there's always plenty of
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:19.360]   equipment to lend to all the friends. What I'm telling you is these are good ways of
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:25.700]   spending money on people and on your children and their friends, and it will give you opportunities
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:32.560]   to potentially mentor their friends in a better way. And so that's also a useful thing. There
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:39.000]   will be people in your children's social spheres that don't have a loving father figure, a
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.900]   loving mother figure, who can arrange an environment where they're safe and where they might be
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:50.060]   able to be spoken into and encouraged and built up, etc. But you can do that. You can
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:56.740]   serve as that loving mentor, that encouraging wise elder that will be so helpful to some
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:02.220]   of your children's friends, and you can facilitate that by investing into something like a vacation
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.220]   home.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:10.320]   I now want to pivot to your social life. This is the other thing that convinced me. I underestimated
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:21.780]   how hard it is for adults, most importantly adults with children, to have meaningful time
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:28.180]   with other adults with children. You go through this phase where of course you're young, you're
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:32.060]   single, or you're married, and it's like, "Ah, it's no big deal. Let's go hang out.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.900]   Let's do all the stuff." And then you start having children and you find yourself incredibly
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.500]   isolated because your single friends don't really know what to do. They don't really
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.580]   know. They're kind of awkward. They don't feel quite so great. The children are loud
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.980]   or they annoy them or something like that. And then your other friends who have children,
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.580]   all of a sudden now everything changes across the board and getting together becomes really,
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.740]   really difficult.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:56.600]   The single thing that I most enjoyed about being in an RV and living in an RV and traveling
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:03.300]   across the country with my family was that we were able to get so much time with all
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.820]   of our college friends who also had children because we could take our RV and we could
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:11.700]   park it in their driveway of our friends' homes. Then we could put all our little children
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:16.260]   to bed in the RV, pop on a baby monitor so we could still hear them and watch them, make
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.520]   sure everything was okay. Our friends would put their children down and we'd go inside
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:25.540]   for a three or four hour night of fun together like we were back in college. It was wonderful.
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:29.500]   And that experience made me realize how I want more and more and more of that in my
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.100]   life. I don't want to give that up. I loved those late night chats when I was in college
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.580]   and I'm not willing to give those up just because I got a bunch of little children.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:43.220]   So I need to plan and develop a lifestyle that continues to include that. And as I see
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.700]   how lonely we all get as we continue on, I need more of that in my life.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:53.820]   And so I have become convinced that a vacation home can be one of the best ways that you
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:58.540]   can facilitate that because it's very easy to drop an invitation to a friend of yours
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:02.700]   and say, "Hey, listen, we're going to be down in the Keys this weekend at our home there.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:07.580]   We got an extra bedroom. Would you guys like to come and join us?" And that's a very wonderful
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:12.140]   invitation that's easy for people to accept. Now, I used to think, "Well, Joshua, listen,
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.940]   right? You got all this money. You're this rich guy. Why don't you just go ahead and
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:19.740]   just pay for them?" And I have done that. But what I have found is that that often can
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:25.420]   insert kind of a weird dynamic into the relationship because the person knows you're making extra
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:29.740]   payments for them. And if that person is gracious and there's a good relationship and you can
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:35.220]   do it without the person becoming – what would be the term? My wife and I use the term
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.460]   "whale," meaning somebody just depends on you. And "whale" is, of course, not
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.460]   the right word. That's just what we call them, is a whale is someone who's always
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.500]   just kind of mooching off of you and asking for stuff. So if you can help keep the person
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:53.220]   from being dependent, I guess a leech would be one word, but also keep them – make sure
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:59.460]   that there's a person who's self-confident enough to receive a gift graciously without
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:04.900]   it harming their own self-confidence, their own self-image, their own personal pride,
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:10.260]   etc., then that can work. But it's still – it's not as easy of an invitation to
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:19.180]   make. And people know that. So although we've done it successfully, meaning invited a friend
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:23.620]   of ours, said, "Listen, come with us. We'll go to a resort. I'll cover all the bills."
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.140]   Usually even what I found there is like I had to couch it. I got a great deal. Would
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:31.740]   you like to come with us, which makes things simpler. Whereas if you have your own home
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:37.860]   that's a stable point of contact, then that can be an easier invitation for your friends
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.780]   to accept. It can be much easier because they know they're not adding to your costs. And
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.500]   then they'll often make an appropriate gesture such as, "Hey, well, I'll pay for the
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.100]   gas for the boat," or, "We'll bring the wine," right? Those kinds of things
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:57.060]   that are good social customs and graces. And you can have more time with your friends.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:02.740]   And it's also by having the gear and the equipment, it means that people want to do
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:07.820]   it. They're more likely to want to come with you. And so I now see what I didn't
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:14.820]   see before. I now see that having the vacation home is an investment into my own social life.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:20.460]   And once again, it's a really great way to do it. I would much rather share...assuming
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:24.460]   we're talking about somebody that you like. I would always much rather share a house with
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:29.500]   somebody rather than us be locked away in our hotel rooms because the serendipitous
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:35.140]   encounters...of course, anybody who needs or wants privacy can just retreat to their
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:42.460]   own room. But it's easier in a house to make yourself available for socializing by
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:48.660]   simply going out to the living room. We all do this. You give the signals and the signs
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.460]   that I'm available and we go out to the living room and, "Oh, look, here you are,"
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.980]   and we'll sit down and we'll talk or let's cook together, let's do something together,
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:38:00.240]   let's play a game. And it just creates those rich, rewarding experiences. And by having
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:06.960]   a vacation home, it can be more of a neutral scenario. Even if it's not that far away,
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:12.820]   it would be unusual, since most people aren't adept at talking openly about their desire
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:19.740]   for socialization, it would be unusual for an average family who has an average home
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.180]   and has a friend who lives 30 minutes away to say, "Listen, we'd really like to see
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.180]   you this weekend. Could you come over and spend two nights with us?" Because the reason
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:33.980]   we're extending this invitation is because we want to spend...have eight hours of conversation.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:39.780]   That's unusual. It's not impossible, but that's unusual. Whereas if you have a vacation home,
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.340]   even if it's something that's an hour away, a little home on the lake, a little home on
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:46.660]   the beach, whatever's appropriate in your area, I don't know, a desert cabin. But even
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:50.020]   if it's just an hour away, you could say, "Listen, we're going to be out at the cabin
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:55.100]   this weekend. Would you like to come out and spend a weekend out at the cabin with us?"
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:39:00.380]   And though it's only an hour away, there's something about the fact that this is the
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:06.900]   cabin, this is the lake house, this is the beach house, this is the apartment in the
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:11.020]   city. We're going to go in and see some shows that facilitate it and makes it easier for
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:18.020]   them to say yes. And you may be able to add 10 or 15 hours of quality socialization to
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:24.060]   your schedule by simply having that. And man, if you could do that once a month, that makes
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:31.100]   a radically more rich and fulfilling life. And you may be able to be a much closer friend
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:36.340]   to your friends in time, right, in normal relationships. You spend a few hours with
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.300]   someone, you start to get past the social niceties and get deeper. You find out what
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:44.020]   your friend's hurts are, your friend's ambitions are, and you can support one another and encourage
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.640]   one another and love on one another in just such a much more powerful way in that kind
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:54.260]   of context. So I at this point now see what I didn't see before, that something like
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:40:04.680]   a vacation home, while it still has those difficulties that I previously identified,
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:11.860]   it can be a tool that is a very attractive and very powerful tool. It can just make a
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:17.900]   big, big difference in the lives of others. And you can use it, you can leverage it in
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:25.380]   many, many ways. A couple more examples. You can leverage this even with your friends from
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:34.340]   other states, your friends from other countries, etc. Many people, quite rightly, will be very
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:46.500]   slow to want to come to your home where you are for an extended period of time. It's
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:51.640]   not that it can't be done, but we all know that house guests of more than a few days
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:58.560]   add extra pressures that can make things more difficult. But when you have a cabin or a
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:05.420]   vacation home, and you can extend an invitation to somebody and just say, "Hey, would you
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.380]   like to use our home?" That could be an incredible blessing. A friend of ours blessed us with
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:14.620]   this the other day at a cabin in Idaho. We were out in Idaho in the RV and we were just
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.420]   traveling a lot. He's like, "Listen, go and stay at our cabin." What a blessing it was
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:23.620]   to have a whole mountain cabin with a beautiful view and a wonderful deck, etc., where we
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:27.900]   could park our RV and just enjoy being in a home for a while. It's something that made
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.020]   all the difference in the world. And then we were able to see it and use it and see
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.220]   our friends. When our friends were able to come to the cabin for the weekend, we went
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:39.660]   back into our RV and sleeping in the driveway, and then we were able to see our friends.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:45.500]   And so it really just inspired me and I realized, you know what? This is a good use of money.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.940]   This is a useful tool in someone's hands.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:54.420]   So now, if you buy that, I want to give you a few suggestions, some things that I have
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:42:02.940]   thought about that I think will be helpful. Number one, I think it's useful to clarify
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:09.620]   some kind of destination for the home. It shouldn't be too far away. There's always
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.860]   this challenge, right? If you buy a vacation home that's a 10-hour airplane flight away,
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:21.540]   you're not going to use it for a spontaneous weekend. Ideally, probably one to three hours
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:26.620]   away. Now, that might be a quick and cheap and convenient plane trip. Sometimes it could
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:33.060]   be a drive. Ideally, of course, in most places it would be a drive, but one to three hours
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:38.120]   away. You get more than three hours and you're going to have some more significant resistance
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.860]   and it's going to be harder for people to take you up on invitations.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:48.500]   If you imagine what for many people is a typical schedule, you're working on Friday and on
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.100]   Monday and you're going to invite somebody for the weekend. Somebody gets off work a
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:59.220]   little bit early, 4.30 on Friday afternoon. If you get packed up and get out and you're
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:05.540]   four hours away, you leave at 4.30, you get there at 8.30, you're not going to have much
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:11.220]   energy left for much socializing on Friday night. So then you're just going to have one
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:16.380]   day Saturday and then on Sunday you may get together on Sunday morning and hang out on
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:21.460]   Sunday morning, but you don't have a lot of time for a lot of activities because you know,
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:26.260]   you know what, it's four hours away, probably got to hit the road by say one o'clock to
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:30.340]   be home by dark and have a chance to unpack from the weekend, unwind to get ready for
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:36.420]   the work week ahead. And so something that's four hours or more is just not going to be
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:42.020]   able to be used as regularly. It may still be able to be used on a special extended weekend
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:46.860]   or a special kind of weekly vacations, but the number of people that you can invite is
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:51.420]   going to be much more limited. Thinking about children, you know, it's one thing to say,
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.580]   "Hey, we're going to be an hour away. Could you drop someone off or can we take them with
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:44:00.780]   us?" Another thing to say, "Can I take your 17-year-old four hours away?" That's more
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:07.260]   of a difficult thing for parents to say yes to if it's at all even advisable. So closer
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:12.780]   is better. If it's an hour away or an hour and a half, somebody finishes up work, 4.30,
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:17.340]   by 6 o'clock they're sitting out on your back deck with a cold drink in their hand, nothing
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:21.940]   better, right? Making dinner, have a great time, get together on Saturday, Sunday, you
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.660]   got all day. Around 3 o'clock or so, 2.30, 3 o'clock, they wrap up, they're back home
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:31.780]   and they're home at 5 o'clock. That is perfect. And so with an hour and a half, if you drew
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:39.060]   a one to three hour radius around your home or your primary area, in most cases you could
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:47.620]   really find something in that area. I do think you want to look for some kind of feature
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:53.980]   that gives you something to want to do, but it also gives you something that other people
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:59.660]   will want to do. What I mean here is your own personal desires might be simple. For
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:05.580]   example, your desires might be as simple as having a sunny patio where you can sit out
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:10.420]   in the sunshine with a good book and read all weekend long. That doesn't cost much,
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:15.860]   and yet for somebody who's an introvert and a reader, that's a perfect thing to do. But
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:29.100]   you will have a harder time inviting people to that and it being appealing to other people
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:34.340]   than if there was say something as simple as a lake out back. And so even if it was
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:39.500]   a lake and you had a couple of kayaks and some fishing poles, you'll get more people
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:44.940]   and have more things to do. And so you want to think about what's the story of this house.
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:50.740]   The story can be any number of things. The story can be there's a lake, water is always
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:57.760]   attractive, a lake, a beach, etc. The story can be there's snow, snow season. The story
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:02.360]   can be there's a beach, something to do, but there's got to be some kind of story associated
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:07.740]   with it in order for people to say, "Okay, yes, I can do that." And the story should
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:11.660]   have obviously be something that you like. But I've known lots of people who will have
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:15.500]   a house and they don't like the beach, but they have a beach house even though they never
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:19.140]   go on the beach themselves, but there are people that they invite who like the beach,
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:25.340]   similar things with skiing, etc. And so just kind of come up with some kind of story for
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:32.880]   the house and then figure out how to improve that story with the equipment. Once you decide
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:38.360]   what the story of the house is, what's the activity of this house? Maybe there's a beautiful
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:43.260]   national park next door to it. So we're going to outfit this house with picnic baskets and
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:47.800]   we can hike into the national park and we're going to have binoculars or stargazing or
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:53.240]   whatever. Find something and then make sure the house has the gear for it and it has the
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:47:00.400]   extra gear. So that way you have it stocked for what you need. If it's a lake house, make
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.800]   sure that you have things that are appealing at different areas. Anybody can have paddleboards,
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.520]   anybody can have kayaks. They don't have to match. They can be old, they can be beat up,
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:13.400]   they can be canoes, etc. But having something to go out and do is going to be much more
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:19.840]   valuable. A number of years ago, I had stayed with a friend at his lake house in Michigan
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:26.560]   and it was wonderful. He had kayaks, they had a Hobie cat, they had a power boat so
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:31.760]   we could ski, we could wakeboard, we could do tubes and all that, which is wonderful.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:37.240]   And then also they had all of the house related stuff. Now, in my opinion, the gear is often
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:44.740]   just an excuse for being together. So yeah, you got some kayaks, that gives you something
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.960]   to do when you need a little break. We always need a little break from one another. Being
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:53.600]   together for 10 hours a day straight doesn't work for most relationships. But you can have
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.760]   a great breakfast, then let's go out on the kayaks. Why don't you guys take the kayaks
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.960]   out? Boom, perfect separation. They're gone for an hour or two, they come back, have a
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:06.240]   nice lunch. What do you want to do? We're going to go out and lie in the sunshine for
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:10.840]   a while. Great. We all have our quiet time, come back together at dinner time, and then
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:16.560]   we go to the fire pit. So the other thing is invest into something that's going to bring
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:21.920]   lots of camaraderie in the actual house and make sure that it's appealing in different
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:27.640]   ways. So the heart of that should hopefully be the kitchen. One of the great things about
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:32.880]   having people together, physically together, staying in the same place, is the chance to
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:40.600]   turn meal times from a sometimes 30 minute event into a three hour event of enjoying
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:46.080]   being together. If you just focus on eating as is common, especially in the US American
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.560]   culture, we're going to go out to eat and we go for a restaurant and we eat, you're
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:55.400]   done in 30 minutes. And you barely even got past the niceties and got into really sharing
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:01.960]   heart to heart. Whereas if you start by cooking together and we have a glass of wine, okay,
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.880]   let's start cooking, you start cooking together, then dinner's ready, you sit down, you eat
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:11.440]   together, you have dessert, oh, we've got to clean up. And there's two people, we'll
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.080]   send the moms to the living room, they can sit and visit, dads will clean up the kitchen
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.640]   or vice versa, right? We're going to send the dads out back to smoke cigars and moms
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:24.160]   are going to clean up the kitchen or whatever it is. You can now stretch that simple event
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.800]   into a three or four hour dinner party. And again, all of us really want that camaraderie,
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:34.360]   that connection, that being together, and you can facilitate that with a really great
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:39.360]   kitchen. So think about having a great kitchen that's open, that gives space for people,
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:43.760]   that gives you the space to cook for people, and then of course learn how to use it so
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:48.160]   that it's not intimidating for you to have 10 extra people over, et cetera. It makes
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.920]   a big, big difference.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:56.320]   Think a lot about having a great place to gather after dinner. And so this might be
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:01.520]   a wonderful living room with a crackling fireplace, this might be a sitting room with a great
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:08.080]   view, it might be a back deck, go ahead and put in a fire pit, it's always a winner.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:13.280]   Human beings, there's nothing more universal than our enjoyment of sitting around together
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:19.000]   and staring at a fire. And so put in a nice fire pit and make it easy to use so you'll
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:25.160]   use it a lot. You might put in a hot tub, you might put in a pool, put in something,
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:30.080]   and again a fire pit is ideal. A nice deck and a fire pit will give you hours and hours
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:37.080]   and hours of conversation with your friends. And it gives it in a way that is appropriate.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:44.920]   I say, stock your house with a really great coffee setup, a nice selection of wines and/or
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:53.480]   other alcohol, and tobacco. Joshua's theory on coffee, wine, or other alcohol, and tobacco
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:51:00.080]   is that these are excuses that adults use to say, "Hey, can we sit and talk?" In
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:06.720]   our modern era, especially men, most men have a very hard time saying to one another, "Hey,
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:10.640]   can we just sit down and talk for an hour?" That's kind of a weird and awkward thing
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:15.800]   to say. But if you say, "Hey, you want to grab a beer?" All of a sudden, you're
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:20.080]   pretty much guaranteed for 20 to 30 minutes of conversation. Two beers and you got an
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:27.200]   hour. Add a cigar to the mix and you got two hours right there. And so these excuses of,
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.200]   "Hey, let's have a cup of coffee," these excuses of, "Hey, let's have a glass
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:35.660]   of wine, let's have a cigar," these are excuses that we use with one another in order
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:40.660]   to say, "Hey, can we talk?" We just don't say, "Hey, can we talk?" because it
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:47.360]   sounds weak. So make sure your house is stocked for that with opportunities just for that
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.040]   direct conversation. You'd be amazed at how much more interaction you can have with
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:52:00.460]   a great fire pit and a well-stocked wine cabinet, or a great fire pit and a cool espresso machine.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:06.760]   Things like that make a big, big difference. What else? I think have a diversity of things
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:13.640]   that will also engage other people. So it's unusual that you can get a 16-year-old to
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:18.020]   sit down and talk to you for hours and hours at a time as well, unless there's something
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:23.680]   to do. And so make sure you've got a number of games. Sit down and play Risk with a 16-year-old
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.840]   who understands how to play Risk. Probably you can have some great laughs, right? Ticket
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:37.140]   to Ride, Risk, Phase 10, some kind of random card game will make a big difference. And
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:42.980]   if you'll use these tools, you'll be able to get people to sit down who wouldn't ordinarily
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:47.480]   be able to sit down. My wife and I were recently guests in somebody's home with our children
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:56.200]   for the weekend. And there was, I think, an 11-year-old in this particular family's
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:01.900]   home. And the 11-year-old couldn't stop staring at his phone screen. And we tried,
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:06.620]   and we tried, and we tried, and we tried. We asked lots of questions and tried to engage.
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:12.060]   But the 11-year-old didn't have the social skills to stop staring at his phone screen
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:19.420]   and spend time talking with us until finally we started playing Exploding Kittens. And
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:23.700]   he liked playing Exploding Kittens. The phone disappeared. And once we got him into the
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:30.820]   game, two hours later, we were able to build a relationship. And while the phone came back
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:36.240]   later, it was a totally different relationship. And without Exploding Kittens, it would not
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:41.300]   have been possible. The previous night, we had tried, and it was just a movie. Well,
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:45.220]   we all sit and stare at the screen. And of course, with friends that you know well, you
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:49.700]   can put a movie on in the background and then you ignore the movie. But in this case, because
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:56.460]   there was still not that close connection, Exploding Kittens was the ticket.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:54:01.580]   That said, I think it's a really good idea to have things that are going to be familiar
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:08.200]   to people. So video games, wonderful solution. Have a great video game console and some games
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.420]   that are going to be really fun. But you might choose games that lead to greater sense of
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:16.940]   togetherness. This was what was so great when the Wii, the original Wii, first came out.
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:22.260]   It was revolutionary and people bought it because the games that were appropriate for
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:27.500]   it were more kind of interactive games and they didn't require much skill. Wii Bowling
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.940]   got you all looking like goofballs in the living room together and it facilitated it.
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:35.980]   And I knew lots of people who bought that console when it first came out because of
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:40.140]   that. And so think about it and choose some games for the console and choose some things
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:45.740]   that are going to be useful. Same thing with movies. Don't just go to Netflix, although
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:49.580]   obviously that can be a great thing, but go ahead and stock some really good movies. Some
[00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:55.820]   movies that will be fun, they'll be widely appealing, and they'll be appropriate for
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:00.500]   varied mixed audiences. So that way you can have many different things. And so if you'll
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:04.940]   have different things in different parts of your home, now you can really encourage that
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:09.820]   sense of togetherness. You might have another family out, you've got wine and cigars on
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:14.940]   the back porch around the fire pit, and you've got the pool table inside with a movie going
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.540]   for the children. And they're getting the same benefit, but you're kind of breaking
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:23.660]   down those things that people are not yet mature enough to articulate. It would be an
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:28.940]   unusual 16-year-old who's able to analyze the social dynamics and recognize, "My heart
[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:35.660]   is really, really desperate for some personal contact, for someone to talk about things
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:40.340]   and seek me out as a person. And so therefore what I really need is to talk with my fellow
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:47.220]   friends heart to heart around something." A 16-year-old can't articulate that. They
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:50.500]   can't do that. A mature adult can of course recognize, "I'm feeling lonely right now.
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:56.500]   I need to call somebody." But you can facilitate that same thing happening for the 16-year-old
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.820]   by investing in the appropriate equipment. So just think carefully about how you equip
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:01.820]   the house.
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:09.380]   A couple more comments. Think about how you can sleep more people in an appropriate way.
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:15.420]   Best thing I have ever seen a number of years ago, I was in the Keys at a friend's house
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:19.660]   in the Keys. And I went over to the neighbor's house. And the house was a fairly ordinary
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:26.740]   house, but they had installed a couple of bunk rooms. And these bunk rooms were not
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:34.620]   big rooms, but what they had is they had quadruple queen bunks in them. And a quadruple queen,
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:41.380]   two sets of those bunk rooms just with quadruple queens automatically means that you can host
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:49.680]   about 16 people without it being that big of a deal. And they were just bunk rooms.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:56.340]   But it was awesome. It was so cool. I remember for me, at first I used to read Coastal Living
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:57:00.580]   Magazine. And when I was younger, I'd keep a look book of all the things that I wanted.
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:03.620]   And I had multiple of these bunk rooms that you would find. You'd find this amazing
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:09.340]   beach house and they'd have a bunk room with 12 bunks in it or 14 bunks in it, et cetera.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:15.740]   And I think that we as people, we love that. Children especially love that. They love the
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:20.860]   chance to go to camp and to be in a bunk room with a bunch of other people. I think as adults,
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:26.060]   a lot of times we still appreciate certain things about that. And so if you've got a
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:31.580]   great house, make sure that you're not too limited by sleeping space. So make a plan
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:37.500]   for it. Install a bunk room and then have overflow. Put a couple of air mattresses.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:41.920]   Maybe get some nice ones for the adults. Figure out where you could pull a room divider across
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.820]   to give a little privacy. Have a couple of sofa beds, et cetera. Maybe have a tent that
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:52.020]   you could set up. Get yourself a canvas wall tent. And that way, if you wanted to invite,
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:58.100]   let's say you had a great lake house, but the lake house only has two or three bedrooms
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:02.340]   in it because that's what's appropriate. Well, don't limit yourself to just only ever being
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:07.540]   able to invite one family or two families. Grab a couple of nice canvas wall tents and
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:11.460]   then invite a few more families and say, "Listen, it's not awesome. I got a canvas wall tent.
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:15.540]   I got some cots here that we can set up, but you'll be fine. We'll put a little propane
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:18.980]   heater in there and you're going to be great." And set those up on the lawn and make it an
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:22.860]   event out of people because the only thing that's more fun than two families being together
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:26.900]   is four families being together because now you're not just forced into too close of a
[00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:31.540]   contact with one other couple or one other set of adults. You have more and then you
[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:36.260]   can involve more and more people and it adds to more fun. And now people can swap out.
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:40.780]   "Okay, I'm going to go kayaking with these guys and now we're going to go out on the
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:47.060]   boat," et cetera. And so your limitation is often sleeping space. You can make a kitchen
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:52.780]   expand. You can get a great table to eat at and not everybody has to sit at a table to
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:58.660]   eat, but you usually want to have sleeping space. So think in advance, "How can I facilitate
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:03.300]   sleeping space?" Grab a bedroom and just stuff it full of bunks. Figure out how you can provide
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:07.940]   appropriate levels of privacy for people, but actually just some sort of mattress for
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:13.300]   them and you can have more people and use it more. And especially if you buy the concept
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:18.420]   that I started with of simply the benefit of having this for your children, it's going
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:24.340]   to be nicer. You can invite more children. You can invite the whole youth group or you
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:29.700]   can invite the whole scout troop or the whole basketball team, et cetera. And you just bring
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:33.660]   along a couple extra chaperones, a couple extra parents, et cetera. And if you have
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:39.260]   appropriate sleeping space, then that can be a great way for you to host a whole basketball
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:43.220]   team, et cetera. And that can be just such a wonderful blessing for your children in
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:48.700]   their social lives and an opportunity for you to encourage and mentor the lives of other
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:54.780]   people. And again, I repeat, what else are you going to do with your money? Spend it
[00:59:54.780 --> 01:00:01.800]   on people. Spend your money on people. And these are some cool ways that you can do it.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:08.860]   The final point is make this easy on yourself. Make this easy on yourself by figuring out
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:15.940]   what you need to do to make it simple. So if it were me, right, when I buy a vacation
[01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:21.460]   home and I choose this is going to be the vacation home, then I will stock it. I do
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:25.860]   this in my own home, but like I'm not going to stock it with my finest china. I'm going
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:30.480]   to go to the restaurant supply store and I'm going to buy 50 matching plates so that we
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:36.860]   never run out of plates and they're always there. I'm going to buy multiple sets of linens,
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:43.020]   right? Just go ahead and get all the stuff. Treat your home like a hotel and so that you
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:48.220]   have it. Find somebody who can clean the house for you. It is way, way better when you're
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:53.380]   hosting if you can figure out how to invest your money into a way of making sure that
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:58.580]   you don't have to do all the cleanup every single time. My least favorite thing about
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:03.900]   borrowing people's houses, my least favorite thing about Airbnb right now is the need to
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:07.660]   clean the houses. It really bugs me because it's difficult. Because at the age of our
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:13.580]   children we desire, right, we want very much to have a place that's clean, but because
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:17.420]   the children aren't great at cleaning yet and they require so much supervision, my wife
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:21.140]   and I often cannot leave a place the way that we would like. Otherwise, I'd have to sit
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.940]   in the car with the children while she cleans or she's got to take them on a walk while
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:29.300]   I clean, etc. And so as a host, I think there's just a real hassle if you've got to say, "Well,
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:34.340]   every Sunday night I've got to stay and clean my house after my guests." That's not going
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:39.860]   to be great. But if you've got a great housekeeper where you just know that every Monday morning
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:44.980]   my housekeeper comes and I pay my housekeeper a flat rate and every Monday morning that
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:50.780]   house gets cleaned, then you'll feel a lot better about using your home and hosting other
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:55.780]   people. If you know that, even if you're doing it yourself, if you know when you're getting
[01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:00.460]   ready to leave the house on Sunday afternoon, we just toss all of the sheets right in the
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:04.420]   washing machine, toss them in the dryer. We don't even have to take them out of the dryer.
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:12.300]   We just hit start in the dryer when we leave. We've got a whole fresh set. And so open up
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:16.500]   your closet, grab a fresh set of sheets, change all the sheets, put those in the washing machine,
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:22.340]   wash, done, boom, we leave. Tell the robot to go vacuum the floors when you're going
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:27.980]   out, then it can be a lot, lot better. Stock your home as well. Stock it with all the stuff
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:32.460]   so that when you're together you don't need to go out. Make sure that you have an extra
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.980]   fridge that's stocked with all the cold drinks. Put a freezer and make sure you've got all
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:40.380]   the foods in the freezer that you're going to want. And maybe if it's at the beginning
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:43.700]   of the season you go out and you spend a couple thousand dollars and you stock up all the
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:48.580]   stuff so that you don't have to shop all season, that also can be a great thing. And it'll
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:53.780]   make your life easier to know you've always got food. There's never a reason for you to
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:03:00.180]   not have plenty of food in your house to host a spontaneous 20 person dinner party. It's
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:05.340]   relatively simple. You keep, even a nice one, you keep frozen vegetables in the freezer,
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:09.720]   you keep frozen steaks packed up ready to go. This is one of the things that I do when
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:16.300]   hosting people is you keep frozen steaks cut up, a little bit of seasoning, vacuum packed
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:23.500]   in vacuum sealed bags. And so then you just have the sous vide ready to go. So you figure
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:27.080]   out how many people are going, you drop the steaks in the sous vide machine, go ahead
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:32.180]   and grab out your frozen green beans, go ahead and grab out your mashed potatoes that are
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:38.060]   just dehydrated mashed potatoes from a box or from a bag, those last for a long time,
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:42.780]   and add some seasonings and away you go. And even if you have no fresh food in the house,
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:48.420]   all of that's there, add a bottle of wine to that, no one will ever wish for anything
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:49.420]   else.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:53.540]   And so think about that and then develop some simple menus, some ways of cooking for people
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:04:01.040]   that you know are reliable. Again, for years I use this with regard to inviting people
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:06.540]   to our house after church meetings. When we have a house and we go to different church
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:11.500]   meetings, we've traveled so much as guests and showed up at places. And one of the things
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:15.740]   that really shocked and hurt me, especially when traveling across the United States, was
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:21.860]   how many church meetings we would go to and how few invitations we would get for lunch
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:27.220]   afterward. And we would show up when we were traveling in an RV, if we were visiting friends,
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:32.820]   we would go to, we'd visit our friend's church of course, or if we had some particular reason
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:36.740]   to be in a place, we would go to a church meeting. But a lot of times we were just traveling
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:41.340]   and it's the weekend and I want to go to a church meeting and meet with some fellow Christians
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:50.420]   on Sunday morning. And so we would go to a local church and my family is not inconspicuous
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:56.540]   and people would say, "Hi, welcome," et cetera. And I would, "What are you doing?" "We're
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:00.900]   traveling," et cetera. And I would tell them. But week after week after we're on the road,
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:07.980]   we got so lonely, just incredibly lonely and really, really wanted for just to have some
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.900]   fellowship, to meet some friends, to talk to some people. And got to the point, I was
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:15.980]   like, "I don't care if I ever go to another church meeting in my life. I don't need more
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:21.140]   sermons. I don't need more singing. Fine, I appreciate that. But what I need is some
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:25.780]   fellowship." And we would go week after week and it felt like, it's like, "Is anybody going
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:29.660]   to engage with us? Is anybody going to do anything other than say, 'Hey, welcome, glad
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:34.140]   to see you again?'" And it really shocked and it hurt me at the state of American Christianity.
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:38.500]   And I resolved, I said, "I will never," it's hard when you actually make a resolve, but
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:43.660]   my intention, right? My intention is that I will never allow somebody to come to a church
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:48.420]   meeting where I am and find out that they're visiting and not invite them for lunch. Because
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:52.820]   it was so hurtful to me and so painful not to have that. And of course, why don't we
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:56.420]   do it, right? Well, we always either, "Oh, my house is a mess," or, "I don't have any
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:00.820]   food in the house." But when you're a traveler and you're really lonely and you just want
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:04.780]   to have some fellowship with somebody, you start to realize that, "I don't care if your
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:08.380]   house is a mess. I'm not judging if your house is a mess. My house is a mess. Houses are
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:11.740]   a mess. That's what happens. It happens to all of us." Or, "I don't care if you have
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:16.580]   any food. If somebody had just said, 'Listen, our house is a mess and we don't have any
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:20.740]   food, but I'll tell you what, we'd love to just visit with you. There's a park down the
[01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:25.100]   road. If you guys want to go to the park where there's a swing set so your kids can get their
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:29.040]   wiggles out, we'll swing by Publix or we'll swing by the grocery store and we'll grab
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:32.500]   some peanut butter and jelly and a bag of chips and we'll meet you down there in a little
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:37.900]   bit.'" I would have said, "Yes," every time. But people didn't do that.
[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:42.100]   Anyway, after that experience, I promised myself, "I'm not going to be in a church meeting
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:47.660]   where there are visitors and not invite somebody for lunch, even if it's as simple as, "Our
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:52.060]   house is a mess and we have no food," because I know what it's like to be that way. It really
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:58.500]   opened my eyes in a way that I didn't previously understand. So far, I've pretty much done
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:05.460]   that. In so doing, what I have learned is I just want to always have my house stocked
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:12.500]   with some stuff that is nice. So again, I'll tell you, I already did it, but sous vide
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:19.660]   steaks in the freezer, buy a big hunk of ribeye, chop it up into nice thick steaks and vacuum
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:22.660]   seal and pack them in the freezer. They'll sit there for six months and be perfectly
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:29.260]   good. You find a family of two or a family of 15, all that matters is you can get your
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:33.020]   sous vide pot up to temperature pretty quickly. You need 45 minutes in the sous vide, which
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:37.380]   is just enough time to get everything else ready and have time to sit and have a glass
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:41.600]   of wine and visit in the living room for a little bit before dinner's on. You can go
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:49.380]   from nothing to a nice Sunday dinner at your home in 45 minutes with some sous vide steaks,
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:53.340]   some frozen vegetables. I try to make sure I keep something pickled, some kind of little
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:57.140]   hors d'oeuvres, little onions or little olives or something like that, some nice stuff. And
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:03.100]   then whatever else you happen to have, again, some dehydrated mashed potatoes or whip up
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:07.220]   some bread or something real quick. And you can serve a meal in 45 minutes that's really
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:13.400]   nice even if you have company and you need it really quickly. So just think about how
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:21.100]   you can institute things that make your life easy. And it does take a little bit of skills,
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:26.700]   takes a little bit of practice, but once you do it, then you can turn your home, you can
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:31.300]   turn your vacation home into something that's just a blessing for others. And in the modern
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:37.720]   world we are living through an epidemic of loneliness. We are living through an epidemic
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:44.540]   of loneliness and we have more ways to contact each other instantaneously and yet we spend
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:53.500]   more time alone than ever before. And so host that, encourage that. Final thing, this one
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:09:03.740]   is dangerous. Think about some ways to encourage that physical, not physical contact, that's
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:09.780]   a deluded term, think about some ways to encourage that face to face interaction. And so it might
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:17.180]   be as simple as it might be something where you just facilitate it by having the appropriate
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:24.460]   games and things. You might put a basket, put a Faraday cage, a basket, a little box
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:29.140]   at the front of your property, put your cell phones here. You might not have internet at
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:33.540]   the property unless you specifically turn it on and plug into an ethernet cable. But
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:39.860]   help people to arrange in an appropriate way, arrange just a break to be together. I think
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:47.420]   here's where being in a remote cabin is really wonderful because they expect it. The Faraday
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:52.820]   box at the front door is a little intense but it can be something where people really
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:57.900]   look forward to it. If you have the personality to pull it off and just to say, "Hey, here's
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:01.940]   the cell phone room. Here's a charger right here. This is where your cell phone is. If
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:05.180]   you need to talk on it, this is where you do it. But cell phones don't come into the
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:10.100]   rest of the house," something like that. And help your guests have a break from it.
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:18.140]   It's just a wonderful way to do it. I'm not so hardcore just simply because I use my phone
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:23.240]   as a camera and I like to take pictures, etc. But I understand and I appreciate it when
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:28.580]   people are intentional about it because it makes a better environment for everyone around.
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:34.460]   So these are some ideas that I've had over the years. I wasn't wrong, as I see it now,
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:39.420]   I wasn't wrong about the downsides of a vacation home but I hadn't yet arrived at a point in
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:45.140]   my life where I could appreciate those upsides. And so at this point in time, I now appreciate
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:50.500]   those upsides in the ways that I have just described to you and I encourage you to consider
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:57.880]   them and if they are applicable, go for it. There are so many of my listeners in this
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:06.780]   audience who are continually fighting the urge to spend money. "I want to be frugal.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:11.500]   Should I really go and spend the money? Should I really go and buy a vacation home?" etc.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:17.380]   Because after all, I could be richer. I just say, "Friend, I'm all for you getting richer
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:23.500]   but I want you to live a rich life now." Being the richest guy in the graveyard doesn't really
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:31.300]   matter. It's kind of a waste. And so to the extent that you want to build more wealth
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:43.820]   and to the extent that you see that minimizing your expenditures will help you, great. Obviously,
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:55.900]   that's a proper form of analysis that you should do. But what's the point of money except
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:00.940]   to use it to buy the kind of life that you want to live? And if you reflect back, the
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:05.340]   thing that you're going to remember and look back on is not what the particular balance
[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:09.760]   of your bank account was at any point in time. You're going to reflect back on the experiences
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:20.660]   that you had. And you can spend money in order to facilitate those experiences. And I don't
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:28.580]   see that there's really any better use of money than that. It's funny, there's another
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:34.260]   weird parable that Jesus taught. I've puzzled about it for years and I still don't understand
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:40.540]   it, but it's the parable of the lazy servant. And it's got this funny verse in the Bible
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:45.460]   about it where basically, paraphrasing it, Jesus tells this parable about there's this
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:50.300]   king and he has a wicked servant and the wicked servant just doesn't do much good. And the
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:54.380]   king's really angry with the servant because the servant was a bad servant. And so the
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:58.980]   servant's like, "What am I going to do?" So he's still a servant of the king. So he calls
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:04.740]   all of the king's debtors and he says, "Listen, you owe the king $10,000, right?" And the
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.980]   debtor says, "Yeah, I owe the king $10,000." And he says, "Quick, mark this down here.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:12.660]   I'm going to change your balance from $10,000 to $2,000. And then the next one, I'm going
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:17.220]   to cut your balance from $100,000 to $50,000." So the king calls the servant for him and
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:20.380]   finds out what the servant has done. The servant's given away all the king's money and the king
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:25.580]   says, "This is a shrewd, shrewd servant." And then there's this weird statement. I should
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:30.380]   have looked it up, but I didn't. But this weird statement where it says, "Use your unrighteous
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:35.900]   mammon to make friends for yourself on earth." And while I have a hard time quoting that
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:42.280]   as gospel truth, it's something that I often say. The whole point of money, you should
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:48.660]   spend money to buy friends for yourself on earth. Not in a weird way, not in the prodigal
[01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:53.820]   son just spending all his money not to buy real friends, but if you can use money to
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:58.500]   facilitate friendship, if you can use money to invest into people, what more valuable
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:02.600]   thing is there? And so often people just think, "Well, the only way I can do that is to go
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:08.700]   and give my money to buy a cow for somebody in poverty-stricken Africa." Well, that's
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:14.820]   fine. And I think that's wonderful. But there's a lot of lonely people around you right now
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:19.940]   who if you invited them over for dinner and you put out a really nice dinner for them,
[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:25.860]   you could really encourage them. And there's a lot of lonely people around your 16-year-old.
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:34.300]   Your 16-year-old has some friends that right now are scheming and researching ways to end
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:42.460]   their life. Your 16-year-old have some friends that right now are trying to figure out what
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:50.940]   to do in the future. And so if you can use your money and among other things can put
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:58.660]   in place some infrastructure that's going to allow you to spend more time with people,
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:04.340]   I think that is a very, very good use of money. I forgot this earlier, so I'll just add this
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:11.740]   as an addendum. One final thing. I think having a vacation home can be a wonderful sense of
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:17.080]   security for your children even as they go through periods of their life. Having a second
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:23.700]   home that if your son or your daughter gets fired from a job, you can say, "Listen, son,
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:28.860]   why don't you move into the lake house for a little bit?" Or your daughter wants to write
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:32.900]   the world's best great novel, but she has no way to make any money on it. "Listen, why
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:37.140]   don't you move into the lake house?" Obviously, your own home might be available, but having
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:43.020]   a kind of that stability for a family member, for your children of knowing they've always
[01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:48.460]   got a home, there's always an extra house available, can be a really nice thing. And
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:52.860]   I think sometimes those of us who care a lot about responsibility, we spend so much time
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:58.620]   thinking about trying to create responsibility in our children that we don't think enough
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:03.900]   about supporting our children. And if you study the children of the wealthy, one of
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:08.980]   the things you find is that the children of the wealthy have a very different psyche than
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:15.540]   do children who grow up in poverty, because they understand that it's almost impossible
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:23.740]   for them to fail. They understand that if I fail, it's okay, because I've still got
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:29.580]   a nice trampoline to fall back on, mom and dad. And I think that's a very valuable thing,
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:35.260]   because knowing that you have a support system, a trampoline, means that you can take bigger
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:40.020]   risks. You can try more interesting flips on a trampoline than you do on a hard concrete
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:44.820]   basketball court. And so you have more opportunity and you can take bigger risks, etc. So I think
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:49.060]   that's a really powerful thing for your children, and it can also be a wonderful thing for your
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:53.580]   ability to help your friends as well, friends who are in need. "Listen, I've got a vacation
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:58.180]   home. You can't stay there forever, but I'd be happy for you to stay there for a month
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:03.540]   and give them some kind of interim housing which can really take the bear off of someone's
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:06.660]   back." So I hope these ideas are helpful to you. If you've got additional ideas, I'd
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:10.260]   love to hear them from you. But those are the best that I've heard. Remember that if
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:13.380]   you would like to speak to me personally, I'm available for consulting at the moment.
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:17.300]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult and you can book a consulting call. We can talk
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:23.020]   about whether you can afford a vacation home or not. What's funny is that in a lot of consulting
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:27.620]   calls, I actually do wind up giving an abbreviated version of this speech that I've just given
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:33.260]   you, basically saying, "Listen, why do you have so much money? I'm glad that you're rich,
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:38.740]   but you've got way too much money. How can you invest your money into your children?
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:45.220]   How can you invest your money into your friends?" And I frequently find myself telling the stories
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:50.480]   that I've just told you and saying, "Go and buy a vacation home. Go and buy a lake home.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.700]   Invest into your grandchildren's life in this way by providing that." And this is something
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:58.780]   that grandparents especially can do. Your children aren't going to ask you to do it,
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:02.460]   but if you've got the money and you can set up a really great place that your children
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:05.940]   are going to want to be at and your grandchildren are going to be at, you can invest into some
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:10.780]   wonderful time with your grandchildren. Which, by the time you reach grandparent's age, you
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:15.780]   generally recognize that what I want is time with people. I'm telling you. You can spend
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:22.980]   your money and you can buy that time back. Not by paying someone to spend time with you,
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:27.580]   but by paying for things that make it easier and more attractive for someone to spend time
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:33.260]   with you. And if that happens and that also results in a deepening of the relationship,
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:39.500]   I consider that a pretty good thing. RadicalPersonalFinance.com/consult.
