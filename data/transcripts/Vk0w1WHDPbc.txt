[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   I would like to direct your attention once more to the great words which are to be found
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:16.000]   in Paul's epistle to the Romans in the third chapter, verses 25 and 26.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.640]   Verses 25 and 26 in the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, "Whom God hath set
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:34.920]   forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.680]   the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God, to declare, I say,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:53.280]   at this time his righteousness, that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.840]   in Jesus."
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.640]   I suppose it's true to say that in many senses there are no more two, no more important verses
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.640]   in the whole range and realm of Scripture than these two verses.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:17.340]   Here at Inneret we have the classical statement of the great, vital, and central doctrine
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.720]   of the atonement.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.960]   And that is why we are considering it so carefully and so closely.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.880]   Somebody has described this as the Acropolis of the Christian faith.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.260]   We can be certain that there is nothing, therefore, that the human mind can ever consider which
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.760]   is in any way as important as these two verses which we are again going to look at.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.240]   And as you know, the history of the Church shows very clearly that these verses, the
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.400]   statement we are looking at, has been the means that God the Holy Spirit has used to
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.060]   bring many a soul from darkness into light, has given many a poor sinner his first knowledge
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.600]   of salvation and his first assurance of salvation.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.080]   Now, to encourage you, to encourage one another to concentrate, therefore, let me give you
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.600]   just one example and illustration out of history, a very well-known one and a notable one.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:29.040]   The case of a man who, I say, found deliverance and release and peace with God and enjoyment
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.800]   of salvation through this twenty-fifth verse in particular.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:42.680]   I am referring to the poet William Cowper or Cooper, whichever you prefer, William Cowper.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.120]   He tells us that he was in his room in an agony of soul and a deep and terrible conviction,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.560]   and he could not find peace.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.880]   And he was walking back and forth almost at the very point of despair, feeling utterly
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.200]   hopeless, knowing not what to do with himself.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.920]   And suddenly, in sheer desperation, he sat down on a chair or a seat by the side of the
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.920]   window in the room, and there was a Bible there.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.960]   And he picked it up and he opened it, and he happened to come to this passage.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.840]   This is how he puts it.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.600]   The passage which met my eye was the twenty-fifth verse of the third chapter of Romans.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:35.440]   On reading it, I immediately received power to believe.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:44.480]   The rays of the sun of righteousness fell on me in all their fullness.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:52.320]   I saw the complete sufficiency of the expiation which Christ had wrought for my pardon and
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.480]   entire justification.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.520]   In an instant I believed and received the peace of the gospel.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.680]   If the arm of the Almighty God had not supported me, I believe I should have been overwhelmed
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.560]   with gratitude and joy.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.080]   My eyes filled with tears, transports, choked my utterance.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:27.040]   I could only look to heaven in silent fear, overflowing with love and wonder.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.920]   Now that is what this twenty-fifth verse of the third chapter of the epistle to the Romans,
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.040]   you see, did for the famous and the great poet William Cowper.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.520]   Very well, it's done the same thing for many another.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.840]   That is why I say you can never look at a more important statement than this.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.680]   Now let me remind you therefore again of what it says.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.040]   It's a continuation of what the apostle has been saying in the twenty-fourth verse.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.840]   This is his great good news, that now it is possible for us to be justified freely by
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:10.960]   the grace of God through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.160]   In other words, there is a way of salvation open now, apart from the law, which doesn't
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.960]   depend upon keeping the law.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.520]   It's this free way which is in Christ, and it's because he has ransomed us in Christ,
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.660]   because Christ has ransomed us.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.280]   Now these verses, twenty-five and twenty-six, explain to us how that ransoming has taken
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.800]   place.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.320]   And furthermore, they tell us why it had to take place in that way.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.760]   Now this is God's way of salvation.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.720]   You remember I told you that that's the theme that begins at verse twenty-one.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.220]   Very well, this is God's way of salvation.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.320]   It is through this ransoming that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.480]   Yes, but why did it have to happen like that?
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.040]   How does it happen like that?
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.720]   Well, we've already considered two of the great words.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:14.680]   The first you remember is the word "propitiation," which means a propitiatory offering, an offering,
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:21.360]   a sacrifice presented to God in appeasement of his wrath.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.200]   That's one aspect of it.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.080]   And then the other word we considered, you remember, is the word "blood," which again
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.200]   simply tells us the character of the offering that's been made.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:37.800]   The blood means the life laid down, and Christ there laid down his life.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:45.360]   That came about because God poured his wrath upon him as the bearer of our sins and guilt.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:53.400]   And thereby, by his blood, he propitiates, he presents this propitiatory sacrifice and
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.400]   offering.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.300]   And that is the thing that we considered together last week, that the wrath of God which should
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.260]   have come upon us came upon him.
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.880]   It was the cause of his death, the cause of the shedding of his blood.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.840]   The blood means the laying down of the life, the taking of the life.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.380]   And that is what happened.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.440]   And so, our Lord, we saw, was able to take his own blood, no longer the blood of bulls
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.260]   and of goats and so on, but his own blood, and he entered into the holy place.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.700]   He offered it there, in that heavenly sanctuary, not in an earthly sanctuary any longer.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.740]   He went right through the heavens into that holiest of all that is there, into the very
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:44.060]   presence of God, and so he has accomplished our ransoming, our redemption.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.140]   And thus, we are saved and are delivered.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.900]   Now then, the apostles told us all that.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:55.700]   We've seen that in the two great words, "propitiation" and "blood."
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:01.540]   And this, of course, is something that comes to us through the instrumentality of faith.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.420]   Faith is the channel through which all this comes to us.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:11.900]   And it is only those who have this faith who experience this ransoming and redemption,
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.060]   and who enter into the fruits of salvation.
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:22.140]   So it is, you see, true to say, whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.140]   in his blood.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.140]   Very well.
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.880]   The statement tells us that.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:38.100]   The cross of Jesus Christ announces that, and it states that, he says, plainly and clearly.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.720]   But you notice the apostle doesn't stop at that.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.020]   He goes on beyond that.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.520]   He says something further.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.600]   Now what is this something further?
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   Let me read it to you again.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.160]   "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.300]   righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God,
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:06.400]   to declare," I say, "his righteousness at this time that he might be just and the justifier
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.880]   of him which believeth in Jesus."
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.000]   Now why did the apostle go on to say all that?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.520]   Why didn't he leave it at that first statement?
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.560]   What is the meaning of this additional statement?
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.940]   Now this is of tremendous importance, and therefore it seems to me that the best thing
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:31.160]   we can do is to consider once more these terms.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:36.440]   And again the first term is the term "set forth."
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:44.560]   That means to manifest, to make plain.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.680]   Now here is obviously something that is of very vital interest to us.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.040]   It tells us this at once, doesn't it?
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:58.640]   The cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, his death on the cross on Calvary, was not an accident.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   It was God who did it.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.680]   It was God who set him forth there.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:08.560]   Oh, how often is the whole glory of the cross missed when men sentimentalize it away and
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.480]   say, "Ah, he was just too good for the world," or "He was too pure.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.640]   His teaching was too wonderful, and cruel men did that to him, and we begin to feel
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.040]   sorry for him," forgetting that he turned on the daughters of Jerusalem that were beginning
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:27.480]   to feel sorry for him and said to them, "Weep not for me, but weep for yourselves."
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.560]   If our view of the cross is one that makes us feel sorry for the Lord Jesus Christ, it
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.880]   just means we've never seen it.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:41.480]   It's God that set him forth, not an accident, but something deliberate.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.760]   Indeed the apostle Peter, you remember, preaching on the day of Pentecost says that it all happened
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.120]   according to the predetermined counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.720]   God hath set him forth.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:01.000]   And the term also does emphasize the public character of the action.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.680]   It's a great public act of God.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:13.480]   God has done something here in public on the stage, if you like, of world history so that
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:21.040]   it might be seen and looked at and recorded once and forever, the most public action that
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.960]   has ever taken place.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:30.280]   God thus publicly set him forth as a propitiation for sins in his blood.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.400]   Very well.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.280]   That now brings us to this very vital question.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.180]   Why did God do this?
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.800]   Why did this ever happen?
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.880]   What was it, if I may ask with reverence, that led God ever to do that, that made him
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.880]   ever purpose to do it?
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:56.200]   Well, there's nothing better that we can do than go on looking at the terms one by one.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.360]   Let's take a look at the terms first, then we'll look at them as a whole, having defined
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:06.120]   them, and we'll see exactly why the apostle felt it was absolutely vital and essential
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.520]   to add this to what he's already said.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.000]   Now then, here is the first term.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.680]   It's this term, "to declare."
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.500]   To declare his righteousness.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:28.720]   This means to show, to manifest, to give an evident token, to prove something.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.320]   Now then he says God has done this in order that Christ might thus ransom us by giving
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.520]   the propitiatory offering.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.400]   Yes, but in addition to that, God is declaring something here.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:45.400]   He is showing something, manifesting, giving an evident token of something.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.560]   Of what?
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.200]   Well, he says of his righteousness.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.960]   Now, we've got to be careful with this term.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:01.400]   It's a term that we've been looking at since verse 21, and we've already met it before
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.400]   that.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:07.600]   Now, it's a little bit unfortunate that the same term is used to cover two slightly different
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.600]   ideas.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:17.240]   So far as we've looked at this term "righteousness," we have seen that it means a way of righteousness.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.960]   Go back to that verse 21, but now he says the righteousness of God without the law is
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.160]   manifested.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:31.480]   In other words, God's way of making men righteous, God's way of giving men righteousness.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.840]   That's what that meant, but here it doesn't mean that.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:41.840]   Here he says that God has done something through which he declares his righteousness, his own
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.320]   righteousness.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.840]   And here it doesn't mean the righteousness which God gives to us, but it means one of
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.600]   God's own attributes.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.520]   One of God's own glorious characters or characteristics.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.480]   It means God's equity.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.800]   It means God's judicial righteousness.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:16.360]   It means this essential, moral, holy, just, and righteous character of God.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.840]   Or if you like, you can take it as he puts it in the next verse, verse 26, that he might
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:28.920]   be just and the justifier of him that hath faith or believeth in Jesus.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:37.600]   Very well then, he is now, I say, here at the cross, declaring his own righteous character,
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.640]   his own inherent and essential righteousness and justice.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.120]   The next word is the word "for."
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.080]   To declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:15:00.080]   "For" means in respect of, or in respect to, or on account of.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:06.160]   He is declaring his righteousness on account of the remission of sins that are past.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.960]   All right, go on to the next word, the word "remission."
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:18.440]   Now "year" is a most important word, and those who attend here regularly will know
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:23.640]   what I mean when I say that it grieves my heart that the authorized version is really
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.600]   most unfortunate at this point.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:33.600]   It's one of those cases where the authorized is very inferior to the revised, including
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.880]   the revised standard version, which is right at this point.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.080]   Now why do I say that this is an unfortunate translation?
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.120]   Well, for this reason.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:56.720]   You look up the words, look up the word "remission" in your authorized translations, and you will
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:02.560]   find that it's used a number of times.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:08.360]   But if you take the trouble to look up the actual word used in the Greek in the original,
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:15.160]   you will make this very interesting discovery, that the word which the apostle used here,
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:24.120]   which is translated "remission," is only used here in the whole of the New Testament.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.160]   The apostle Paul didn't use it anywhere else.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.040]   Nobody else has used it at all.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.840]   There is another word which is translated "remission," and in its various forms you
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.800]   will find it seventeen times in the New Testament.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:47.400]   But here is this word that is only used once, and it really doesn't mean "remission."
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.400]   What does it mean then?
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.240]   Well, it really means this.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.800]   It means "pretermission."
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.520]   Now this is an important word that we must look at.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.080]   P-R-E-T-E-R, mission.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.640]   Pretermission.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.080]   What does "pretermission" mean?
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:13.800]   What does "to pretermit sins" mean, as distinct from "to remit sins"?
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.040]   Well, this is a very interesting word.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.200]   It is a word that is used in Roman law, and it means this.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.240]   When you find it in Roman law, it is generally used in this sense.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:33.080]   It refers to somebody who has made a will, and he has left somebody out of the will.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.120]   Imagine a man making a will, and he leaves something to a number of his friends, but
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.240]   one great friend he doesn't leave anything to.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.400]   That's pretermission.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.720]   He leaves him out.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.080]   He leaves him out of the will.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.000]   He leaves him out of consideration.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.360]   It means, if you like, to pass over.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.880]   The man gave something to all these friends and relatives.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.560]   He passed over that one.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.560]   Pretermit.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.960]   That's the very word that is used here.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:05.800]   To pass over, to overlook or to disregard, to allow to pass without notice, to overlook
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   intentionally.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:14.920]   Now, those are the senses which were given to this most important word, which the apostle
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.080]   deliberately chose at this point.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.600]   Now, when the apostle does a thing like that, he must have a very good reason for doing
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600]   so.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.960]   He doesn't do this sort of thing accidentally.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.480]   Why didn't he use the word that is used elsewhere?
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.160]   Why this word here and here alone?
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.560]   And why this particular word that means passing over?
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.880]   Well, because he obviously means to convey the idea of passing over.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.800]   So instead of translating for the remission of sins that are past, we should read for
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:52.200]   the passing over of sins that are past, for the overlooking of sins that are past.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.600]   If you like, we can put it like this.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:05.000]   The difference between remission and pretermission is the difference between forgiving and not
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   punishing.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Now, you may say that's splitting hairs.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.960]   That's a distinction without a difference.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.960]   It isn't really.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.320]   Of course, in the end it comes to the same thing.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.040]   If I don't punish a man, well, in a sense I have forgiven him, and yet I haven't fully,
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.080]   you see.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.720]   If I forgive, I certainly haven't punished.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.440]   But to forgive means more than not to punish.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:33.840]   So this term pretermission, passing over, stops short of remission.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:40.760]   And that's why it's such a pity that the authorized translators translated it here as remission.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:46.400]   It's for the passing over, for the overlooking of sins that are past.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.160]   All right, let's hold on to that.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.120]   That's a very important point, as you'll see in a moment.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:20:00.760]   The next phrase we come to is this phrase, "that are past," for the passing over of sins
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.400]   that are past.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:08.000]   Again, the authorized isn't quite as good as it should be.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.280]   Taking this authorized translation, you might well come to the conclusion that the apostle
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:21.960]   is saying that it's the passing over of past sins, and anybody's past sins, my past sins,
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.840]   your past sins, sins that are past, past sins.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:31.400]   But you know, that isn't really what the apostle was saying, that isn't what he meant.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:39.320]   A better translation here is this, sins that were formerly committed.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.800]   Now he's referring to a very definite time.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.520]   What is the time that he's referring to?
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:50.160]   Well, it's the time that he contrasts in the next verse with "at this time."
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.400]   There was that time, there is this time.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.720]   He says, "God hath set forth Christ as a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.160]   righteousness for the passing over of sins formerly committed in the forbearance of God,
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.360]   to declare, I say, at this time."
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.640]   What's he looking back across?
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.200]   He is looking back at the Old Dispensation.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:19.360]   He says that God passed over sins under the Old Dispensation, under the old covenant,
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.800]   in the Old Testament times.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:29.020]   And his point is that God has done this and set forth Christ in order to do something
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.900]   about what he did then.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:37.360]   So that brings me to the last word that we've got to consider in this 25th verse, which
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.840]   is the word "forbearance."
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.840]   What is forbearance?
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:49.960]   Well, as you know, forbearance means self-restraint.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:56.120]   It means tolerance or toleration.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.920]   Now then, what exactly is the apostle saying here?
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:04.320]   "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:11.560]   righteousness for the passing over of sins formerly committed through the self-restraint
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.500]   of God."
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.500]   What is this?
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.500]   What does it mean?
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:22.280]   Well, what he's really telling us is, isn't it, that this public act which God enacted
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:33.700]   on Calvary has reference, first and foremost, to God's action under the Old Testament dispensation
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:45.300]   when he passed by, when he overlooked, passed over, the sins of the people at that time
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:51.200]   in his self-restraint and in his tolerance.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.760]   Now what does all this mean?
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.700]   Now in a very interesting way we can answer that question by showing you the same kind
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:02.200]   of statement in two other places in the New Testament.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:07.920]   You remember the apostle Paul addressing that congregation of Stoics and Epicureans and
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.780]   others in Athens.
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.760]   You'll find it in the seventeenth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, and
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:18.920]   I'm going to quote particularly verse thirty, Acts 17, 30.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:23.960]   The apostle working out his argument says, "But the times of this ignorance God winked
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:31.080]   at, but now commendeth all men everywhere to repent."
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.560]   You remember how he works out his great statement.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:41.040]   He says God has not left himself without witness through all these generations and centuries.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.580]   You remember the argument?
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:48.380]   He says that he's left his signs that people should seek the Lord if happily they might
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:53.200]   feel after him and find him, though he be not very far from every one of us.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.160]   For in him we live and move and have our being, as certain also of your old poets have said,
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.200]   for we are also his offspring.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.520]   For as much then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the God that
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:10.440]   is likened to gold or silver or stone, graven by art and men's device.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:17.040]   And the times of this ignorance, all these centuries, God winked at.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.000]   But now commendeth all men everywhere to repent, because he hath appointed a day in which he
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.920]   will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:32.160]   given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.160]   Now there's one help to the elucidation of this.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.280]   The other, of course, is found in the passage which we read at the beginning.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:45.480]   And I want particularly to read again verse 15 in the ninth chapter of the epistle to
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.200]   the Hebrews.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   Listen to this.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:25:00.840]   "And for this cause he, Christ, is the mediator of the new testament, the new covenant, that
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:09.760]   by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant,
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:15.960]   they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.720]   Now that is precisely the same thing.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.920]   Hebrews 9.15 is saying exactly the thing that the apostle is saying here in the second half
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   of Romans 3.25 and in verse 26 also.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.360]   What is the argument?
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:37.040]   Well, the real commentary on this verse is found in that ninth of Hebrews.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:43.160]   And you see what the writer is there saying is this.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.800]   He was saying you must be clear about that old covenant and those sacrifices and offerings
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.600]   which the people took to God under that old covenant.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.960]   You must be quite clear in your minds about them, he says.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.800]   You must see quite clearly that they were never capable of producing a full forgiveness
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.600]   of sins.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.160]   They did not expiate sin.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.080]   They could do something, and they did that.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.080]   What was that?
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:18.840]   He says, as you remember, that they were of value in the purifying of the flesh.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.280]   You will get that there in the thirteenth verse.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.320]   "The blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:31.640]   sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh."
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.600]   But it couldn't do any more.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.340]   You see, it couldn't deal with the conscience.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.340]   That is the difficulty.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.120]   And yet the whole problem is with respect to the conscience.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:48.000]   He says, "But if they could do that, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.960]   the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.540]   works to serve the living God?"
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:02.180]   He says, "All that was but a figure for the time then present, in which were offered
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:08.520]   both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:15.480]   to the conscience, which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:22.680]   ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:28.960]   But now Christ being come, and high priest of good things to come, etc., etc."
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.080]   Now then, do you follow the argument?
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.600]   What he's really saying is this.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:43.500]   Under that old covenant, under the old dispensation, there was no provision for dealing with sin
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.080]   in a radical sense.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:55.640]   It was simply a means, as it were, of passing them by, covering them over for the time being.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.100]   They gave a kind of purification of the flesh.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.120]   They gave a ceremonial cleanness.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.580]   They enabled the people to go on praying unto God.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:14.480]   But there was no sacrifice under the Old Testament that could really deal with sin.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:20.640]   All they did was to point forward to this sacrifice that was coming that could really
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:28.960]   do it and cleanse the conscience from dead works and truly reconcile men unto God.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:33.440]   Well, do you mean by that, Sir Summon, that the saints of the Old Testament were not forgiven?
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.800]   Of course I don't.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.420]   They were obviously forgiven, and they thanked God for the forgiveness.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:43.120]   You cannot say for a moment that people like David and Abraham and Isaac and Jacob were
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.120]   not forgiven.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.220]   Of course they were forgiven.
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:53.440]   We are all children of Abraham because we are children of faith.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:29:00.120]   The dead that are right with God go to Abraham's bosom, says our Lord in Luke 16.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:05.880]   They were forgiven, yes, but they were not forgiven because of those sacrifices that
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.120]   were then offered.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.400]   They were forgiven because they looked to Christ.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.200]   They didn't see it clearly, but they believed the teaching and they took these offerings
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   by faith.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:23.440]   They believed God's word that he was going to provide a sacrifice, and in faith they
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.440]   believed.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:30.600]   And it was their faith in Christ that saved them exactly as it is faith in Christ that
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.600]   saves now.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:37.000]   Now, that's the argument.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.800]   But you see, that in a sense left a problem.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   What was the problem?
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.440]   Well, the problem was this.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.200]   God had always revealed himself as a God who hated sin.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:57.560]   He had announced that he would punish sin and that the punishment of sin was death.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:03.480]   He had announced that he would pour out his wrath upon sin and upon sinners.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:12.040]   And yet you see, here is God for centuries, apparently and externally to all appearances,
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.240]   going back on his own statements and on his own word.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.680]   He doesn't seem to be punishing it.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.160]   He's passing it over.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.400]   Has God ceased to be concerned about these things?
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.720]   Has God become indifferent to moral evil?
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:34.120]   How can God thus pass over sin?
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.720]   That's the problem.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.640]   And it was a very real problem.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.760]   It's clear that the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer can't do
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.760]   this.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.360]   And yet God has passed these by.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.760]   Well, how does he do that?
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:54.800]   What is it that justifies this forbearance of God?
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:01.720]   Now says the apostle, God has really explained it all to us by what he did in public, before
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:09.000]   the whole world, on the stage, and in the theater of the whole world, in Christ.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.440]   He held back his wrath throughout the centuries.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.480]   On what grounds did he hold it back?
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:20.320]   Well, he didn't disclose it then, but he has disclosed it now.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:26.120]   He's declared it now, and he says, I repeat that, "To declare I say."
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.560]   That's one of the things that's happening on the cross.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.600]   On the cross on Calvary's Hill, God has been giving a public explanation of what he
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.800]   had been doing throughout the centuries.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:44.760]   And at the same time, he vindicates his own eternal character of righteousness and of
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   holiness.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.540]   Well, how does he do that?
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:52.960]   How has he done it on the cross on Calvary's Hill?
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.280]   Now let me answer that question.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.440]   And as I do so, you will see why I was at such great pains of fortnight tonight to defend
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:06.760]   that word "propitiation" and to hold on to it at all costs, because it was so vital.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.760]   How has God done this on Calvary?
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.560]   How has he vindicated his character?
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:19.120]   How has he given an explanation of his passing over of those sins in his self-restraint and
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.880]   tolerance?
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:28.280]   There is only one way in which he could do it.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:35.800]   God has stated that he hates sin, that he will punish sin, that he will pour out his
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:43.440]   wrath upon sin and upon those guilty of sin.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:51.060]   And unless God can prove that he has done that, he is no longer just.
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:56.600]   But what the apostle is saying is this, that on Calvary he has done that.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:04.240]   He has shown that he still hates sin, that he is going to punish it, he must punish it,
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.160]   that he will pour out his wrath upon it.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.640]   How did he show that on Calvary?
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:17.960]   Well, by doing that, by doing that, what God did on Calvary's hill was to pour out upon
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:27.400]   his only begotten and beloved son his wrath upon sin.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:33.640]   The wrath of God that should have come upon you and upon me because of our sins fell upon
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:38.720]   him.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.400]   God always knew that he was going to do this.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:48.000]   We read in the scriptures of the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   God always knew it.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.360]   It was a plan from eternity.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:57.440]   And it was because he knew that he was going to do this that he was able to pass over the
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.920]   sins during all those centuries that had gone.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:11.200]   And thus, you see, says the apostle, God at one and the same time remains just and can
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.760]   justify the ungodly that believes in Christ.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.280]   You see, this was a tremendous problem.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:28.120]   How can God remain holy and just and deal with sinners he says he is going to, and yet
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.120]   forgive a sinner?
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.840]   That is the problem.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.840]   And the answer is to be found alone on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.000]   And it is an essential part of what is declared on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.040]   Now then, says Paul, that was the first reason.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.500]   God has had to vindicate what he has been doing in the past under the old covenant,
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:52.160]   but he has got something more to do, he says in verse 26, to declare, I say, at this time
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:56.080]   also his righteousness.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:00.480]   He has now explained how he could pass over all those sins, but how does he deal with
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.480]   sins now?
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.520]   How is he going to deal with sins in the future?
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:10.240]   Ah, the answer is still there on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:16.720]   The teaching, in other words, is this.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:22.760]   The cross on Calvary, the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:29.780]   As the apostle John puts it in the first epistle, second chapter, second verse, is the propitiation
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:36.520]   for our sins and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:42.840]   That particular world that is meant there, the sins of that were dealt with once and
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:47.400]   for all on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:52.640]   It is on the cross on Calvary that all those sins under the old dispensation that God had
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:36:00.560]   passed by and had, as it were, thus pre-termitted, the sins that he had forgiven to Abraham and
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:07.680]   Isaac and Jacob and all the believers, all the cold, it is there the means is provided
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.000]   for doing that.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.480]   Their sins are covered on Calvary.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:17.360]   Yes, says Paul, and the sins that are being forgiven now are also dealt with there.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:22.560]   And all sins that will ever take place are also dealt with there.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:27.560]   That's the amazing thing about the cross on Calvary.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.560]   He died once and for all.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:33.080]   It's the great argument of the epistle to the Hebrews, you remember.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.520]   He says, "Oh, those others, they had to be offered day by day.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.440]   You had a succession of priests, and they had to go on making their fresh sacrifices.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:52.280]   But this man, once and forever, and he has dealt with all the sins there.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.240]   There is no need for anything further.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.320]   There is no need for a fresh sacrifice.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.360]   It's been done once and forever.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.720]   God laid them all on him there.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:08.080]   The sins you've not yet committed have already been dealt with.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.360]   There is the means of forgiveness, and there alone.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.600]   Time passed.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.680]   Sins committed formerly, sins committed now, all times.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:25.080]   Here is the justification of God for forgiving any sin whenever committed.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:30.640]   Now that's what the apostle is saying here.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:36.920]   All sin is forgiven on these grounds and on these grounds alone.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.120]   So you see what the cross declares.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:47.720]   It declares that God is just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:51.320]   Shall I put this to you in this form?
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:59.840]   The cross of Calvary does not merely declare that God forgives us.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.840]   It does declare that, thank God.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.560]   But it doesn't stop at that.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:11.160]   If it only declared that, the apostle could have finished verse 25 at the word "blood."
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.480]   There was no need for more.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.480]   But he doesn't stop there.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.480]   He goes on.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.680]   He goes on in verse 25 and adds verse 26 to it.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.680]   Why?
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:26.200]   Well, the cross isn't merely the declaration that God is ready to forgive us.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.560]   Or another way I can put it is this.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:37.420]   The cross is not only and not merely meant to influence us.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.400]   You know the popular teaching today, don't you?
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.920]   That's exactly what it tells you and that's all it tells you.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.560]   It says, "Oh, you see, the trouble with mankind is that it doesn't know that God
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.600]   is love.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.240]   It doesn't know that God's already forgiven everybody."
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.240]   What's the meaning of the cross?
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.900]   Well, it's God telling us that he's forgiven us.
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.880]   And when we see Christ dying, it breaks our hearts and at last we see it.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.000]   The cross is directed to us only.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.760]   But it isn't, says Paul.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.080]   It does speak to us.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.600]   Yes, but it does this other thing.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.000]   It's got a bigger object than that.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.960]   Our forgiveness is only one thing.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.240]   There's something infinitely more important.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.240]   What's that?
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.040]   Well, it's the character of God.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.800]   So the cross goes on and tells me this.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:27.240]   This is God's way of making forgiveness possible.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.560]   Forgiveness is not an easy thing for God.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.720]   I speak with reverence.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.200]   Why is not forgiveness an easy thing with God?
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   Well, because God is not only love, but God is also just and righteous and holy.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.880]   He's light in whom is no darkness at all.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.120]   And he's as much righteousness and justice as he is love.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.840]   I don't put them against one another.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.440]   I say God is all these things together.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:57.400]   You mustn't leave out the one or the other.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.320]   So the cross does not merely tell us that God forgives.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:06.440]   It tells us that that is God's way of making forgiveness possible.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.880]   It's the way in which we understand how God forgives, and I'll go further, how even God
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.680]   can forgive and still remain God.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.720]   That's the question.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.300]   The cross is the vindication of God.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.440]   The cross is the vindication of the character of God.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:30.240]   The cross not only shows the love of God more gloriously than anything else, it shows his
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:35.880]   righteousness, his justice, his holiness, and all the glory of his eternal attributes.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.240]   They're all shining together there.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:46.040]   And if you don't see them all, I say you haven't seen the cross.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:51.960]   And this is why once and forever we should reject the so-called moral influence theory
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:56.400]   of the atonement, the one I've just been describing to you.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.320]   The theory which says that all the cross has got to do is to break our hearts and to bring
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.720]   us to see the love of God.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:08.860]   Oh, I say beyond it and above it, Paul says he's declaring his righteousness for the remission
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:12.360]   of sins that are past.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.080]   Why this if it's merely a declaration of his love?
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.520]   No, says Paul, it's more than that.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:22.640]   If God just forgives, people will say, "But is your God a God on whom we can depend therefore?
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.640]   Is he righteous?
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.640]   Is he just?"
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.160]   And it's a fair question.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:33.080]   The character of God is involved.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.240]   You see, God isn't a man.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.800]   We think it's wonderful for people to say one thing and do another.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.400]   The parent says to the child, "If you don't do this, you shan't have that sixpence to
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.400]   buy your sweets."
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.120]   And then the boy does the thing and the father says, "Well, it's all right."
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.040]   Gives him the sixpence.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.000]   God doesn't do things like that.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.320]   God, if I may so put it, is eternally consistent with himself.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.880]   There's never a contradiction.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:07.200]   He is the father of lights in whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:13.200]   And all these glorious attributes are shining like diamonds in his eternal character.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.360]   And all of them must be manifest.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.760]   And in the cross, they're all manifest.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:26.640]   How can God be just and justify the ungodly?
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:39.720]   The answer is that he can because he has punished the sins of these ungodly sinners in his own
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.520]   son.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.320]   He has poured his wrath upon him.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:49.000]   He bore our chastisement by his stripes.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   We are healed.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.480]   God has done what he said he'd do.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.000]   He has punished sin.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.320]   He says it through the Old Testament everywhere.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.240]   And he's done what he says.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.160]   He has shown that he's righteous.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.000]   He's made a public declaration of it.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:13.400]   He is just and he can justify because having punished another in our stead, he can forgive
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.400]   us freely.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.720]   And he does it.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.240]   That's verse 24.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:24.880]   Being justified, being regarded, declared, pronounced righteous freely by his grace through
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:30.920]   the redemption, the ransoming that is in Christ whom he has set forth as a propitiation through
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:37.640]   faith in his blood and thus declares his righteousness for having passed over those sins in his time
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.640]   of self-restraint.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:46.160]   To declare, I say, his righteousness then and now and always in forgiving sins and thus
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:58.480]   he is at one and the same time just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:04.280]   Well, my friends, I leave it at that this evening.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:09.760]   There is this great and glorious and wonderful statement.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.880]   All I beg of you is this.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:22.520]   Make sure that your view, your understanding of the cross includes the whole of this statement.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.920]   Test your view of the cross.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:29.520]   Where does this statement about declaring his righteousness and so on, where does it
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.840]   come in, in your view of the cross?
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.240]   Is it something that you just skip over and say, "I don't know what that means.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.240]   All I know is that God is love and that he forgives"?
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.240]   Well, what's the meaning of this?
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.520]   This is an essential part of it.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:50.400]   On Calvary, God was making a way of salvation that you and I might be forgiven.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:56.000]   Yes, but he has to do it in a way that will leave his character inviolate, that will leave
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.280]   the eternal consistency still absolute and unbroken.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:08.360]   Once you begin to look at it like that, you see that this is the most tremendous, the
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:15.400]   most glorious, the most staggering thing in the universe and in the whole of history,
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.900]   the two things.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.920]   God is declaring what he's going to do for us.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:34.200]   He is declaring at the same time his own eternal greatness and glory, that he is light and
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:39.640]   that in him is no darkness at all.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:49.420]   When I survey the wondrous cross, and you don't see the wonder of it until you put
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:46:01.340]   this into it also, he was declaring publicly once and forever his eternal justice and his
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.580]   eternal love.
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.100]   Never separate them.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:12.240]   They belong together in the character of God.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.140]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd Jones.
