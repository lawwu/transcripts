[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   let's talk about fluoride i've already been accused of being a sunscreen denier no i actually
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.100]   believe that sunscreen exists i do occasionally use zinc oxide sunscreen a little bit i prefer
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.400]   a physical barrier because i'll wear a hat or something if i i don't tend to burn very easily
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.300]   but if i feel like i might burn i use a physical barrier um i'm being somewhat facetious here
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:33.560]   because people will say all sorts of things but um i did an episode about water a little bit about
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.700]   oral health certainly not the depth or expertise that you're providing today so thank you and i said
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:49.240]   yeah fluoride does a bunch of things my question was and remains why are we drinking fluoride but
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.100]   this relates to okay i'll tell this story briefly it's not as cool as your story i was taken to a
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.920]   dentist when i was a kid and they put me they put these like a like a mouthpiece with fluoride gel in
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.580]   it on the top and bottom and they sat me in a little wicker chair in front of a tv with cartoons and i
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.760]   hated it it tasted awful and it kind of like had this sour thing so i was probably six or seven
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.680]   so i drank it i just sucked it up drank it down turned around barfed all over the wicker chair oh my
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.060]   gosh fluoride's a poison but everything is a poison at high concentrations so most everything is a is a
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.500]   fluoride is a poison excuse me at high concentrations so i don't have anything against fluoride but it is
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.680]   a poison then the question becomes if something is not dangerous in a small dose or concentration
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.780]   what are its cumulative effects this is what this is what i have issues like people say oh going through
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.280]   the x-ray machine no big deal but what if you fly 150 times a year yes is it cumulative and so like
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.380]   the logic of the the sort of pushback from the traditional if i will uh community sucks like
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.700]   they're just not logical these are my colleagues sometimes too right just you go to the dentist to
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.560]   get an x-ray they're like running behind the the next wall put you in a lead shield and then they're
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.840]   like oh no it's no big deal well how many you know maybe how many times a year can you do this
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:25.780]   before it becomes ideal so my question is what is the rationale for putting fluoride in water in
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.600]   drinking water given that the contact time in the mouth is so short and then what what's the cumulative
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.320]   effect of bringing fluoride into the gut over and over and then earlier you said something and i've never
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:46.520]   thought about this the bones contain hydroxyapatite 60 i think you said 60 of your bone minerals are made
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.740]   from hydroxyapatite fluoride infiltrates the minerals of the teeth and replaces it so is fluoride going
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.460]   into our bones skeletal fluorosis okay so i'm not trying to paint a scary picture here but but frankly
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.840]   and people can probably tell my blood pressure goes up a little bit when people say oh you know you're
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.320]   anti-fluoride i'm not anti-fluoride but i just don't get the logic it doesn't make sense you're thinking
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.040]   critically about the about it like why would i continually bombard my system with fluoride
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.680]   at the level of the gut at the level of my bones if it's good for me tell me it's good for me but
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.460]   they're saying oh it's so that poorer populations don't have uh decaying teeth sounds like a good
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:32.040]   argument not even counter-arguing it but i can't piece together the logic and like most public health
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.380]   arguments i feel like neither side is is explicitly clear about what exactly they're arguing about and
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.580]   that's part of why i have this podcast to try and get clarity okay i'll do my best yeah and please
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.980]   don't worry that you're gonna offend anyone because i'll offend everybody and they've already said
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.480]   anything they everything they possibly could and they'll and they'll say more so i'm not afraid to
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.020]   open up these topics anymore i appreciate that and and i'll take the heat i well i will get it too
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.640]   don't worry i've already i have thick skin at this point but you have great teeth and they don't so and i
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.420]   haven't had a cavity for multiple decades and haven't used fluoride and portland isn't fluoridated
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:22.840]   portland is not it is not so let's talk about that so fun story uh back in 2011 2012 i was working
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:30.620]   on the pro water fluoridation campaign volunteering in portland picketing and handing out educational flyers
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.160]   um because i thought we needed it in our water and this is because that's how i was trained
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.580]   um and i just never questioned it i never picked up a journal to look at the other side i thought
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.080]   anyone speaking out against water fluoridation that's the tin hat brigade that's the woo woo caucus
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.960]   all the things i was that person the woo woo caucus that's pretty funny yeah so i went to a debate
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:05.240]   um in portland pro versus against i don't like those terms but it's just the easiest way to describe it
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.940]   and i was sitting kind of on the pro side and just waiting to see these pseudoscientists come out
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:20.380]   to to speak and i was so profoundly impressed with what they said and also had no idea that there were any
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.020]   concerns with with fluoride i'd never been taught that in dental school the endocrine disruption the
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:33.340]   neurotoxicity um this the skeletal fluorosis i knew about dental fluorosis but i at that point was of
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:39.460]   the mindset well it's just aesthetic you know but your teeth are stronger and the microbiome issues too
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:46.000]   so it didn't take long i just started rabbit holing and there's so much literature and this again this was
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.280]   quite a while ago um and more and more data in literature is coming out to question the practice so
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.180]   it's important to go back to the history of water fluoridation i'll try to be brief but
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:03.440]   in the early 1900s there was a dentist in colorado springs frederick mckay who noticed his patients had
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:11.400]   mottled um brown spotted teeth but they were really strong they weren't getting decay and so this kind of
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.600]   spread and they started kind of trying to understand the why and they realized there was a really high
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.820]   concentration of fluoride in the natural water supply that this community was drinking and this
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:29.440]   just kind of spread like wildfire with very little evidence-based medicine to back it because this was
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.980]   in the early 1900s now it was like the 1930s um so no long-term safety studies or efficacy studies and
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:44.720]   it was put in as an experiment in grand rapids michigan in the mid-40s after about a decade or so they
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:51.260]   noticed that caries rates cavity rates were going down and so based on this observation it just went
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.820]   like wildfire throughout the united states and i believe about 80 percent of the united states is
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:03.660]   fluoridated so the pro advocates if you will will say it's the greatest public health movement of the
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:10.620]   the century because decay was such an issue it's important to know dental decay is the top chronic
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.160]   disease globally in children and adults it's almost entirely preventable i think we've just normalized
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.800]   it you just get cavities but i'd like to point out we're one of the only species to get dental decay
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.600]   wild animals don't get decay our domesticated animals do because of what we're feeding them the kibble
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:36.380]   you know processed animal food so here we are so it's been controversial from the beginning you know
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.460]   epidemiologists endocrinologists neuroscientists have always challenged it saying this is a bad idea
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:50.360]   it's a highly reactive element you know the fluoride ion um can interfere with iodine um uptake and again
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:08:00.560]   skeletal fluorosis neurotoxicity etc so about seven years ago um there there was the people there's a federal
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.220]   trial in northern california but it was federal the people versus the epa it was a task a trial
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:12.240]   and this has been ongoing for the past seven years and basically they were saying where is your safety
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.340]   data epa on the long-term effects of water fluoridation so the idea was that if we put it in
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:24.540]   the water it's not a very efficient way to get fluoride to people but eventually it may will make itself
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:32.240]   into the saliva and have a topical effect coming out through the saliva they used to think systemically
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:39.420]   it was actually incorporating into the developing teeth and children making the enamel stronger that
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:44.880]   way but that's been debunked so now it's most likely still a topical benefit maybe a little bit of a
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:52.180]   systemic benefit touching the teeth um and we do know fluoride really needs to work topically we don't
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.980]   need to be ingesting it and that is all through the data and they're teaching that in dental schools
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:04.040]   now too okay but this is the easiest way to get fluoride to the masses because caries or cavities
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:10.400]   are such an issue now my first comment on this is we're not addressing the root cause of dental decay
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:16.360]   which is our food it's all the ultra processed foods again we didn't really see dental decay in humans
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.940]   until the agricultural revolution the industrial revolution and now the ultra processed
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.700]   food craze that's been happening the past many decades okay is that right so if we look at
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:32.400]   skeletons from dead people obviously well you can look at skeletons alive people skeletons and dead
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:41.700]   people uh from dead people that um died prior to 1900 how are their teeth 1900 they still have
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:49.120]   they would have decay but if you looked at about 10 000 years ago um very little you know unless they
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.680]   lived in an area with a lot of fruit abundance or honey like where are you getting your sugar from
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.140]   you know and you go pick some berries on a bush you're competing with the animals and the birds you
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:04.880]   didn't have much opportunity to over consume sugar um but you know there was the sugar trade and then we
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:12.160]   just sugar was a sign of wealth and royalty and people's teeth just rotted out and it was because of our diet
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.880]   so that's the root cause issue that no one's talking about you know we're just saying let's slap
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:24.100]   fluoride on it how about we educate and teach people what is really causing cavities but anyway okay so the
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:32.800]   task of trial was going on and the judge um judge edward chen was waiting for this national toxicology
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:39.780]   programs report which was under the department of health and human services and this is it reads like a soap opera
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:46.820]   to be honest with you um and it kept getting delayed and and um postponed and they wouldn't release it
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:54.580]   and finally under the freedom of information act he said this needs to be released and it said there is a
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:11:02.660]   strong correlation between increased fluoride consumption and iq issues in children um and so with that
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:09.380]   he he took this information and he made his ruling now this was after years of expert testimonies as
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:15.540]   well okay um saying there's an unreasonable risk to current water fluoridation practices in the united
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.420]   states this was his ruling that just happened late last year i mean it's this is very new
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.620]   and epa you now need to fix this you need to regulate this better
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:31.780]   what people will argue is a lot of the studies they were looking at that are showing lowered
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:38.900]   iq and children or neurocognitive issues it was at 1.2 or 1.5 milligrams per liter
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:46.100]   of you know um that was the concentration the united states we now do 0.7 milligrams per liter
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:52.660]   but what this that's per liter okay so how many liters of water do you drink a day this is the
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:59.780]   controversy so for example the american academy of pediatrics generally recommends pregnant women
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:06.260]   drink two to three liters a day um you might be cooking with fluoridated water making your pasta
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:11.940]   making your soup um how do we really know how much someone's getting exposed to what's their body
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:17.860]   composition how much do they weigh what are the other outside sources of fluoride are they swallowing
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:24.660]   their toothpaste fluoride is in many pharmaceuticals because it helps increase bioavailability especially
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:32.900]   um ssris and prilosec a lot of these have fluoride in them really yes ultra processed foods will have
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:41.060]   fluoride so the factory that's making your rockstar energy drink or your high c or you know whatever
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:46.820]   you're consuming they're not using reverse osmosis to filter the water so you're getting fluoride that
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.860]   way it's naturally found in green tea and black tea and this is not to make people worried about
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:57.540]   green and black tea i still consume them it's more to say how are we really understanding how much is
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:05.300]   exposed to and so they were finding that pregnant women um they follow there's many studies now but
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:13.140]   a famous one was rifka green study out of canada and they followed about 520 mother child pairs um they
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:19.540]   tested urinary fluoride and the mother per trimester averaged it and then followed these children to the
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:26.260]   age of three or four and did iq tests and found that mothers who had higher concentrations of urinary
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:33.220]   fluoride the children tested lower on their iq tests up to five to seven points and that's on par with lead
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:40.100]   okay on par with lead on par with lead yes and so that was in 2019 there's been so many more studies
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:47.300]   now so the judge ruled epa you need to regulate this better in that amount of time there was a
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:54.020]   meta-analysis that came out that further supported the ntp report by jama pediatrics okay and this is
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:14:01.140]   very controversial for these editors to be putting out by the way so i commend them um and also a
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:07.140]   a cochrane report came out cochrane collaborative which has said this again was very recent looking
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:13.140]   at all the data from water fluoridation water fluoridation isn't reducing decay like we thought
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:22.900]   it was it's only reducing decay by about one quarter a cavity per person one quarter of a cavity per person
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.700]   so that's not statistically significant so people will say well what gives why were
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:34.980]   cavity rates going down when we added fluoride to the water well it's hard to say maybe they were
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:42.740]   already just going to going down due to education more access to dental hygiene and toothbrushing
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:50.100]   flossing um but also we now have fluoride everywhere in our toothpaste so fluoride was put in the water in
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:56.260]   the 1940s it wasn't added to our toothpaste until the 1960s and now it's everywhere we get fluoride
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:03.620]   everywhere rinses the varnishes that made you vomit at the office and by the way that's very common that's
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:09.780]   very common and it's because a lot of those fluoride varnishes um number one fluoride you know it does have
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:15.460]   a poison control label on it you're not supposed to swallow it but these varnishes also have polyurethane and
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.500]   hexane derivatives and then it's what makes them so sticky yeah i i still loathe going to the dentist
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:26.900]   i think i think it's because of that that um early association yeah yeah so it's very controversial and
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.940]   unfortunately we've lost sight of the science it's getting buried in politics right now and it really
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:37.380]   upsets me because it's not a political issue we just need to look at the data and i feel like we're
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:43.140]   losing sight of the scientific method um we you know the american dental association the american
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:48.820]   academy of pediatrics is doubling down on saying we have to put fluoride in the water and for nothing
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:55.380]   else i think it's important to know 97 of the world does not fluoridate their water this is a very united
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:04.340]   states controversy um many countries removed it and found i think it was denmark germany japan they have
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:09.700]   very low decay rates and why is this well they educated their population on what's really causing
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:15.220]   decay and also made fluoride toothpaste accessible and i have danish relatives they have very nice
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:20.740]   teeth if you told me that there's no fluoride in the drinking water in england i might um i might uh
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.380]   like well you know sorry my english friends but that's the stereotype right that their teeth are bad i
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:31.060]   don't think that that's true any longer i think that that uh was true at one point that i think they're
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:36.660]   crowded and crooked too and a lot of that has to do i think with facial development as well i think
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:45.380]   we're we see a lot of um western european they do have that kind of dysmorphic face if you will probably
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:51.140]   from nasal breathing who knows why industrial revolution allergies mouth breathing etc why did it
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:59.220]   why does it seem more prevalent there um so that's this that's the the take the quick take on it and
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.860]   so i just think it should be a personal choice you know if you want to use fluoride you can go out to
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.260]   the store i mean you can get fluoride toothpaste at the dollar store now they give it out for free at
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:15.460]   many clinics um to me i just think it's a it's a medical ethical issue we're mass medicating a population
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:23.380]   without their consent and then the even bigger issue for me is no one's talking about this nor can i find
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:30.420]   any literature on it what is it doing to the gut microbiome because it is an antimicrobial so that
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:37.060]   would be a wonderful study nih if you're listening can we test you know people that live in fluoridated
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:42.420]   areas versus those that don't can we follow them maybe it's a prospective cohort study to just see how
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:48.020]   their microbiomes are different because it just doesn't make sense to me and why would we ingest
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:54.900]   something systemically with all these potential risks when we could just use it topically or actually
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:18:02.420]   talk about what's really causing decay if fluoridation worked it cavities wouldn't be the top disease in
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:09.060]   our country in our children and many worry well if we take it from the water decay may go up and it may
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.420]   i mean there's been they've they did this in calgary canada where decay rates went up but then if you
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:19.700]   actually look at the data the decay rates were already going up when they removed it but they
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:26.980]   only show you the data that they kind of want to show you for that so um but again it's a risk benefit
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:33.540]   analysis i mean i think dentists tend to be too focused on teeth and so you mentioned like if they say
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:38.900]   it's good for me i'll do it well good for what good for your teeth or good for your whole body
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:44.020]   or good for your brain and i think that should be an individual choice are you for as a parent
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:51.460]   do i want to choose one quarter less cavity in my child or do i want to preserve their optimal brain
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:19:01.700]   development i mean the the data that show deficits on par with what one sees with lead exposure that's
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:07.780]   the most striking yeah thing to me yeah and i'm a dentist i was trained to fix teeth i can fix a one
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:14.180]   quarter cavity in a tooth i can't fix a developing brain we have one shot to develop a brain we have one
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:20.020]   shot to grow a face you know it's really important i really appreciate you taking us through the full arc
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:25.220]   of the history of it i think it's extremely important that people take that in so they can start to form
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:33.300]   their own opinions and um you pointed out a number of um logical flaws in in just the the way the whole
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:44.420]   system is is um arranged right now which is this mass uh treatment of everybody with a with a potent
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:49.940]   chemical especially given the amount of water that people drink and cook with etc and without
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:57.780]   their consent and um and without a risk assessment so you're low decay rate i might be a really high
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:04.340]   decay rate you you don't need anything extra your diet your balance your microbiome's great i'm not
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:10.340]   eating well my hygiene's terrible you know we we can't just blanketly be treating everyone the same
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:16.660]   we're supposed to be doing risk assessments okay so i think that pretty much puts fluoride in a
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:21.940]   not in a box let's say on the shelf for all of us to look at i think this is going to be a very
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:28.340]   important aspect of public health in the year to three years to come with this new administration
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:34.180]   and bobby kennedy paying a lot of attention to fluoride and i really like what you said about
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:42.180]   trying to remove the political aspects of this if this becomes a um blue versus red left versus right
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:47.780]   thing we're never going to get to the heart of the matter um yeah and that would be really sad and
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:55.060]   the ones that would really suffer would be kids the children so a uh a non-partisan uh look at this
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:00.740]   which is how i heard everything that you said um just seems really critical uh
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:09.220]   where are they getting the fluoride so water fluoridation um the fluoride that they get
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:17.940]   is a byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry and it's it's called hydrofluorosilicic acid
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:24.900]   so as a byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry it's considered a hazardous waste and it's very
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:33.060]   expensive to dispose of uh but they have found that if diluted in theory and put it's an acid first of
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:40.340]   all so if it's put into our water system it is so diluted that it becomes safe but i will say it you
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:47.540]   know everyone can go research this and look at themselves but it does come in like cement bags with
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:53.620]   skull and crossbones on the front and they do have to wear hazmat suits to put it into our water
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.220]   um they're supposed to titrate it and i think what's interesting you know we're supposed to
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:03.540]   target 0.7 milligrams per liter um i've been involved in some educational campaigns and and
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:09.460]   have tested communities surrounding portland it's very hard to keep it in range you know and so there
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:15.620]   are some communities testing as high we've seen as 2.2 milligrams per liter which definitely falls into
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:21.220]   based on the the science and literature more concerning zone for neurocognitive issues and other
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:28.820]   health issues so um if you're concerned you can call your local water um bureau municipality
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.620]   i will say i don't think the federal government's going to have much control over this it would be
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:40.260]   nice if the epa stepped in um they have appealed by the way uh but it will come down to more like on
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:47.540]   the state level and local level and we're already seeing states like florida and utah um have run it
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:53.780]   through and initially done a we're going to ban this um as a mandatory thing in our state and i think
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:23:00.420]   it's uh north dakota kentucky there's other states picking this up too and other communities that are
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:14.580]   removing it or or not adding it to their water so it's an interesting time to observe all of this
