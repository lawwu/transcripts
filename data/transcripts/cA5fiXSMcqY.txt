[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.500]   All right, moving on.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.100]   We have a question from Pierre.
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.300]   Pierre asks,
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.500]   how do you manage your online presence when doing Phantom
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.300]   part-time jobs?
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.700]   He elaborates that he's a software engineer and he is
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.100]   concerned about his boss monitoring his work status
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.500]   using Microsoft Teams.
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.900]   So he goes on to elaborate,
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.500]   if you stop working early,
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.900]   how do you deal with tools like Teams that communicate your
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.900]   online status?
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.400]   For example,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.000]   my supervisor might start asking questions if I'm often listed
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.600]   as being absent or don't respond to messages.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600]   So while I like the idea of Phantom part-time jobs,
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.100]   I feel like Teams prevents me from effectively doing it.
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.200]   Any advice for this issue?
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.500]   All right,
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.900]   so just quick backgrounds, Phantom part-time jobs,
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.500]   of course,
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.500]   is my terminology for when you get really on your game about
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.700]   organizing your work,
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.400]   full capture,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.300]   quarterly, weekly, daily planning,
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.700]   you're on top of things,
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.000]   you're going to free up a lot of time
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.900]   because most people are not on top of things.
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.700]   So you're going to hit whatever the reasonable workload is
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.400]   for your position in less time than your peers.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.100]   And now you have two options.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.800]   You can take that extra time and invest that into your main
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.800]   job and therefore accelerate the acquisition of career capital
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.500]   and opening up more options or advancement in your career,
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.700]   or you can take that time and say,
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.400]   I'm going to invest it in other parts of my life.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.000]   So maybe I have another endeavor I'm working on,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.300]   or maybe it's a non-professional interest.
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.700]   I'm now going to spend much more time on.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.200]   I'm going to take advantage of this free time.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.300]   Now my argument from an ethical perspective is that if you're
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.000]   in a non-entry level,
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.600]   knowledge work style job,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.900]   where you're not being paid by the hour,
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.900]   you're being paid a salary to fulfill a particular role.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.000]   The strict number of hours you work does not really enter this
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.700]   equation.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.200]   If I am hiring you to be the associate director of marketing
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.600]   for some startup or something like this,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.100]   I am hiring you to do that role and the things that come along
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.400]   with that role and to execute them at a high level.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.100]   I'm not hiring you to punch seven hours or eight hours into
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.200]   a particular time clock.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.100]   That is a crude proxy for productivity that I think we've
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.900]   moved beyond.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.700]   So I think it's completely appropriate if you think you're
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.200]   executing at a high level.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.500]   And my definition of a high level is you seem that you're
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.100]   doing better than your peers that are in the same company.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.600]   Oh, my act is more together.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.300]   I'm being praised for what I'm producing.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.900]   I'm getting things done.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.400]   I'm getting things done when I say I'm going to get them done.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.700]   We're hitting objectives.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.300]   People seem to be happy with my work.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.000]   If you're hitting those markers,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   then I don't care how many hours you're spending.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.800]   And this is taking five hours a day.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.500]   You have just freed up more time to do something else.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.700]   I think that is completely fine for non-entry level,
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.200]   non-hourly knowledge work.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.600]   You have a problem here that there seems to be a hyperactive
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.900]   hive mind culture at your workplace.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.800]   Where work is coordinated in ad hoc fashion with back and forth
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.700]   unscheduled messaging in your case on teams.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yeah, that's a bigger problem.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.100]   That's the whole issue.
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.300]   I tackle in my book a world without email.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.000]   It's a terribly ineffective way of getting a bunch of human
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.300]   brains to coordinate and collaborate on producing value.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.500]   So that's a bigger problem.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.300]   Maybe buy him a copy of my book.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.300]   But for you in the short term,
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.500]   what should you do about your phantom part-time job?
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   I would say spread it out.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.900]   I think it's the simplest solution here.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.400]   So instead of having the mindset of I can now get my work done
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.700]   in five hours instead of eight.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.600]   Instead of having the mindset of then I will work till 2.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.700]   And then stop working.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.900]   Instead say, okay, I am now going to spread three hours of
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.800]   other types of things throughout my day.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.400]   That's much more maskable.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.100]   That's much less notable, right?
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.500]   The other thing I would recommend here is even if your
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.100]   boss is a big believer in a hyperactive hive mind culture
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.800]   and you don't want to confront him about this and it's too
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.100]   difficult to change the whole team.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.800]   You can still move your individual interaction with him
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.000]   and the rest of your teams or her and the rest of the teams.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.200]   You can move it away from the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.900]   I talk about this in a world without email by just thinking
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.200]   about internally.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.400]   What are the different things I'm involved with again and
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   again in my job?
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.000]   Call these processes.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.100]   Given just what I can control assuming I cannot control
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.800]   anyone else.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.000]   What changes can I make into how I execute these processes
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.100]   that will minimize the number of unscheduled messages that
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.900]   show up in teams or emails that have to be responded to?
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.300]   Just focusing on what you can control you can often make
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.600]   a drastic reduction in the amount of these unscheduled messages
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.300]   that arrive that require a response by just nudging people
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.500]   into better implementations without telling them you're doing
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.800]   that without calling them better implementations.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.700]   This is where you just sort of say casually.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.800]   Yeah, you know if the bug review,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.700]   I think what we should do here is use this bug review
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.800]   tracking software seems to be really great.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.600]   You know anything you have put it in there.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.100]   I will go through it on Monday and I will give you a call
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.700]   Monday at 1 or stop by your office.
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.000]   I have any questions and and then I'll sort of know what
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.700]   we're up against.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.500]   I don't know if that's what software developers actually
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.100]   do. I'm making up all these words, but you see what I'm
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.900]   doing here kind of specifying what you're going to do.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.900]   In a way that minimizes back and forth messages without
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.800]   ever talking about bother me less.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.900]   I'm too distracted.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.000]   Stop doing this.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.100]   Send me less messages.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.500]   All people care about is this thing will get taken care
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.900]   of its clear how it's going to happen.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.300]   Great.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.400]   That's one less thing.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.300]   I have to worry about and they will move on.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.800]   So here that's what I would say you should be doing is
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.800]   spreading out your phantom part-time job and then to
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.800]   slowly starting to nudge the way you work with your
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   colleagues away from the hyperactive hive mind that's
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.200]   going to give you a lot more leeway.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.700]   Thank you.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.800]   [Music]
