[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Today we're joined by our friend Jen Wilkin, wife, mom, Bible teacher, and the author of
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.280]   the fabulous book, Women of the Word, How to Study the Bible with Both Our Hearts and
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.440]   Our Minds.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.960]   The book turns four years old this summer and it's already sold 200,000 print copies
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.960]   alone.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.960]   Incredible.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.760]   A whole forest has died for good cause.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.200]   Jen, besides clear-cutting an entire forest, what did you set out to do with this book?
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.240]   When I set out to write Women of the Word, first of all, I never even thought I would
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.320]   become an author.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.360]   I was just head down teaching the Bible in the local church and this was the method that
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.960]   I had come to identify as being helpful for women over the years.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.440]   I was not even familiar with the observation, interpretation, application method that existed.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.360]   I ended up coming up with my own formula of comprehension, interpretation, and application,
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.240]   which appealed to my Baptist feelings about acronyms because it's spelled CIA and was
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.880]   an easy way to help women remember those three steps.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.640]   But I had just developed a method based on my background, having studied English and
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.640]   having studied literature, and then trying to apply basic interpretation tools that you
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.280]   would use with any book to this most precious of books.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.080]   The main obstacle for women is usually just not knowing where to start.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.520]   I would say the main obstacle for anyone is just not knowing where to start.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.360]   And so this was an opportunity to give them a starting point and to give them basic tools.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.440]   Women were conditioned by the resources that had been created for them that you would find
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.560]   in the typical Christian bookstore to passively receive instruction about the Bible, but they
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.520]   were not growing in their capacity to rightly divide the word on their own.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.160]   And that was problematic to me.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.840]   But I never intended to write a book.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.640]   I had blogged some on the ideas because I just wanted the content to be there for the
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.480]   women who were doing my study and didn't even know that anyone was reading my blog.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.360]   I didn't even know how to check the stats for like the first year that I had a blog.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.840]   Which is kind of good, because I think I would have panicked if I had known that people were
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840]   reading it.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.720]   So I got a call one day from a publisher saying, "Would you want to write a book?"
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.520]   And so I did.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.840]   And I thought I could pawn it off on a few of my family members and could use it in my
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.120]   Bible study.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.400]   And it ended up being read by a lot of people, which is pretty exciting, because when I started
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.240]   talking about Bible literacy, I perceived it was a problem that was pervasive in the
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.760]   environments I had had exposure to, and I suspected it was a larger problem.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.080]   But I would say I got confirmation on that once the book came out.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.400]   And so it feels pretty gratifying to think, "Hey, we could actually make a dent in this."
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.720]   People can perceive their need, and they can perceive that there's a way forward.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.120]   But who knows 10 years from now or 20 years from now, what might be the fruit of that?
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.600]   Amen, well, you've made a dent for sure at 200,000 print copies sold already.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.680]   So four years out now, what has been the most surprising reader response to the book?
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.200]   People saying, "I've been in the church my whole life, and no one has told me how to
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.320]   do this."
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.760]   I had heard that from women, but I did not think I would get that email several times
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.760]   a week.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.680]   So I just began to realize that when we talk about Christian discipleship, we have had
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.400]   a blind spot around this.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.480]   We have thought that the sermon was enough to teach people the Bible, or we have assumed
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.600]   that they already had basic Bible literacy, and neither of these assumptions was accurate.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.960]   I think we can trace some of the problem to the death of Sunday school in many church
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.040]   environments.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.600]   And Sunday school is not a sacred cow, but having dedicated learning environments, the
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.280]   way I usually say it is active dedicated learning environments.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.040]   So environments where we say our primary stated purpose is learning versus community or something
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.480]   secondary, and then we guard them as places for active learning.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.720]   So in other words, the teacher doesn't do all the work, the student is going to work
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.000]   as well.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.520]   And so to have places where people are learning, not just to absorb content, but actually to
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.440]   engage critical thinking around what they're learning is what I believe the church needs
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.600]   as we move forward into a post-Christian culture.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.040]   Yeah, speaking of trends, you've been teaching the Bible for many years.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.160]   Inside the church, are you encouraged at Bible trends that you see or concerned?
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.440]   What do you see?
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.640]   I'm encouraged by a trend that others find to be alarming, which is that people are leaving
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.640]   the church.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.880]   And that sounds terrible.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.120]   That sounds unchristian.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.680]   I don't believe that the church of God shrinks.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   And so I think what we're seeing is a revelation of who the church truly is, and that those
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.160]   who remain are going to be more committed to owning their faith than previous generations.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.040]   And Bible literacy will be a big component of that.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.200]   We have one book that we are responsible for.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.040]   It's made up of 66 books, but that's not an unlimited amount of content.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.760]   And although none of us will master it in the years that we have during this life, we
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.200]   can take a pretty good crack at it if you give us some decent tools.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   Amen, for sure.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.760]   Jen Wilkin, thank you for taking some time today and talking with us.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.920]   And congratulations on the success of your book.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.600]   But we're not done, because next time I want you to come back to look at how social media
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.400]   and Instagram are changing the way we do Bible reading.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.000]   We'll do that with Jen Wilkin when we return on Friday.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.280]   Thanks for listening to this special guest episode of the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.800]   We'll see you then.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
