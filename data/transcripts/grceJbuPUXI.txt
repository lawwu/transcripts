[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   The following is a conversation with Sagar Anjati.
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.800]   He is a DC-based political correspondent,
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.200]   host of "The Rising" with Crystal Ball,
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.600]   and host of the "Realignment" podcast
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.680]   with Marshall Kozlov.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.520]   He has interviewed Donald Trump four times
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.800]   and has interviewed a lot of major political figures
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.160]   and human beings who wield power.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.920]   He loves policy and loves history,
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.000]   which makes him a great person to sail
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.640]   through the sometimes stormy waters of political discourse.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.400]   He showed up to this conversation with a gift
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.160]   of the second volume of Ian Kershaw's biography on Hitler,
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.320]   a two-volume set that is widely acknowledged
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.160]   as one of the greatest, if not the greatest,
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.280]   most definitive studies of Hitler.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.360]   Nothing wins my heart faster on a first meeting
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.840]   or a first date than a great book
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.480]   about the darkest aspects of human nature and human history.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.320]   I think I started saying that as a joke,
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.520]   but actually there's probably a lot of truth to it.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.160]   I love it when we skip the small talk
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.440]   and go straight to the in-depth conversation
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.960]   about the best and worst of human nature.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.760]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.440]   Jordan Harbinger Show, Grammarly Grammar Assistant,

[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.560]   As a side note, let me say that for better or for worse,
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.880]   I would like to avoid the trap
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.400]   of surface political bickering of the day.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400]   I do find politics fascinating,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.200]   but not the talking points produced
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.080]   by the industrial engagement complex
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.840]   of red versus blue division.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.440]   Instead, I'm fascinated by human beings who seek power
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.880]   and how power changes them.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.960]   I don't have a political affiliation,
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.080]   and my ideas, at least I hope so,
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.080]   are defined more by curiosity
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.360]   and learning in the face of uncertainty
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.520]   and less by the echo chambers who tell me
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.440]   what I'm supposed to think.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.920]   I'm constantly evolving, learning,
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.240]   and doing my best to do so without ego and with empathy.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.920]   Please be patient with me.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.000]   As far as I'm aware,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.360]   I do not have any derangement syndromes,
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.080]   nor do I get a medical prescription
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.400]   of blue, red, white, or black pills.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.200]   If I say something, I say it because I'm genuinely thinking
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.080]   and struggling with the ideas.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.800]   I have no agenda, just a bit of a hope
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.680]   to add more love to the world.

[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.720]   There's no better gifts in this world
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.800]   than a book about Hitler, so thank you so much.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.160]   I've gotten a gift when I was,
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.000]   what were we just talking about?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.160]   - Yes, right, right. - Flying the watch
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.400]   from Joe Rogan, and this almost beats it.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.800]   So tell me what this particular book on Hitler is.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.880]   So this is volume two.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.000]   - Yes, so this is Ian Kershaw.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.520]   He wrote the famous two-volume on Hitler.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.120]   I'm a big book nerd, and I spend a lot of time
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.180]   reading biographies in particular.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.960]   So this one, if you need a one-volume,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.840]   "Rise and Fall of the Third Reich," right?
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.520]   I think you talked about that, William Shire,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.520]   because that's like Hitler's rise,
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.320]   Nazi Germany, the war, et cetera.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.960]   But I like bios because it's the,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.320]   a good biography is "Story of the Times," right?
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.400]   And so this one, the first volume, it does exactly that,
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.880]   which is that it doesn't just tell the story of Hitler.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.240]   It's the context of poor, you know, this kid in Austria,
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.360]   and he's got all these dreams,
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.400]   but then actually pretty courageous
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.860]   in terms of World War I, right?
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.800]   Gets pinned to metal on by the Kaiser,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.120]   and then what it's like to lose World War I
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.020]   and actually lose this stain,
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.800]   and then the rise within, everybody knows that story,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.560]   the Beer Hall Putsch and all that.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.920]   This one I like, and the reason I like Kershaw
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.680]   is obviously, number one, it's English,
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.000]   which is actually hard, right?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.560]   Like in order to write that story,
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.040]   who can do both the primary source material
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.160]   and then translate it for people like us,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.000]   but he tells the dynamic story of Hitler so well
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.880]   in this second volume, just like the level of detail.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.200]   And you've talked about this, Lex,
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.880]   like what was it like inside that room,
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.200]   inside with Chamberlain?
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.520]   Like what was it like in terms of
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.400]   who was this like magnetic madman
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.600]   who did convince the smartest people
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.720]   in the world at the time?
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.720]   And you know, up until like 1940,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.120]   the Soviet gamble, like was it,
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.360]   it took tremendous risks, but like highly calculated,
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.520]   thinking, no, no, no, no, I'm not gonna pay for this one.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.800]   I'm not gonna pay for this one.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.560]   And it put himself, he had a remarkable ability
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.960]   not just to put himself in the minds of the German people,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.440]   but in terms of his adversaries,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.640]   like with when he was across from Mussolini,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.760]   calculate, he's like, how exactly did Mussolini,
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.800]   the guy who created fascism,
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.440]   becomes like second fiddle to Hitler?
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.640]   Think it's an amazing bio.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.880]   And yeah, like Ian Kershaw, along with Richard Evans,
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.280]   two of my favorite authors on the Third Reich, no question.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.600]   - Do you think he was born this way,
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.360]   that charisma, whatever that is,
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.040]   or was it something he developed strategically?
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.200]   That's like the question you apply
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   to some of the great leaders.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.520]   Was he just a madman who had the instinct
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.920]   to be able to control people
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.520]   when in the room together with them,
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.000]   or is this like he worked at it?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.320]   - I think he worked at it.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.660]   But also there is an innate quality.
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.920]   I'm forgetting his name, his lifelong,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.000]   Rudolf, the one who flew to Berlin in like 1940.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.840]   I forget his name.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.560]   Anyway, so he helped Hitler write "Mein Kampf,"
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.640]   and he was like slavishly devoted to him in prison.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.600]   This is 1925 or something like that.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.920]   And so you read that and you're like,
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.000]   well, how does he get this like crank wacko
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.320]   to basically believe he's like the second coming,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.680]   help him write this book?
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.440]   I mean, literally they lived together in the prison cell
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.480]   and they would wake up every day.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.440]   And as he was composing "Mein Kampf"
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.800]   and because of the beer hall putsch and all that,
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.020]   had this like absolute ability to gather people around him.
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.800]   I think his greatest skill was,
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.120]   is he was just a very good politician, truly.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.080]   I mean, if you look at his ability
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.620]   in order to read coalitional politics
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.400]   and then convince exactly the right people
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.080]   in order to follow him.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.400]   I think I heard you ask this once
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.520]   and I've thought about it a lot,
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.560]   which is like, who could have stopped Hitler
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.400]   in Germany, right?
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.080]   That's always like the ever present question.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.200]   Of course, like the whole baby Hitler thing.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.680]   Really the answer is Hindenburg.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.040]   Like Hindenburg was the person who could have stopped
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.000]   and had the immense standing within the German public.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.880]   The only real like war hero,
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.760]   definitely was personally skeptical of fascism and Nazism.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.800]   - And didn't like Hitler.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   - And didn't like him.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.280]   And he knew he was full of shit.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.200]   He was like, yeah, I think this guy is dangerous.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.720]   I think this guy could do a lot of damage to the Republic,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.000]   but he acceded basically to Hitler at the time.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.800]   And I think that he was one of the main people
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.200]   who could have done something about it.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.160]   - And also he was able to convince the generals,
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.000]   the military.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.640]   I mean, that was very interesting.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.360]   And to convince Chamberlain
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.560]   and just the other political leaders.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.200]   That's something I often think about
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.760]   'cause we're just reading books about these people.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.080]   I think about what like Jeffrey Epstein, for example.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.920]   - Oh yeah.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.500]   - Like evil people, not evil,
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.160]   but people have done evil things.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.700]   Let's not go to the Dan Carlin thing of what is evil.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.420]   People that do evil things,
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.280]   I wonder what they're like in a room
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.760]   because I know quite a lot of intelligent people
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.760]   that did not see the evil in Jeffrey Epstein
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:37.040]   and spend time with him and were not bothered by it.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.320]   In the same sense, Hitler,
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.040]   it seems like he was able to get,
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.900]   just even before he had power,
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.500]   'cause people get intoxicated by power and so on,
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.660]   they wanna be close to power.
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.060]   But even before he had power,
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.660]   he was able to convince people.
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.540]   And it's unclear,
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.820]   is there something that's more than words?
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.100]   It's like the way you,
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.940]   I mean, people talk, tell stories
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.860]   about this piercing look and whatever,
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.740]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.220]   I wonder if that's somehow a part of it.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.600]   Like that has to be the base floor
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   of any of these charismatic leaders.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.820]   You have to be able to, in a room alone,
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.280]   be able to convince anybody of anything.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.120]   - So I can tell you from my personal experience,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.480]   one of the best educated lessons I got
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.380]   was when I got to meet Trump.
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.520]   So I interviewed Trump four different times as a journalist,
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.320]   spent like two and a half hours with him in the Oval Office,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.820]   not alone, but like me and one person
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.000]   and like the press secretary.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.840]   And that was it.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.480]   So I actually got to observe him.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.320]   And as a guy who reads these types of books, right?
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.360]   And you think of Trump, obviously most people,
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.720]   what they see on television, in articles and more,
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.960]   but being able to observe it like one-on-one,
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.600]   I was closer to him than I am right now from you.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.520]   That was one of the most educational experiences I got
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.160]   because it's like you just said,
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.720]   the look, the leaning forward, the way he talks,
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.920]   the way he is a master at taking the question
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.040]   and answering exactly which part he wants.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.360]   And then if you try and follow up, he's like, excuse me.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.320]   You know, like he knows.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.600]   And then whenever you're talking,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.240]   it's not that he's annoyed about getting interrupted.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.400]   If he realizes he's been marandering
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.040]   and then you interrupt him, all good.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.320]   But if he's driving home a point,
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.180]   which he has to make sure appears in your transcript
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.320]   or whatever, it's like,
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.360]   it really was fascinating for me to look at.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.080]   And what was also crazy with Trump
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.920]   is I realized how much he was living in the moment.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.720]   So like when I went to the Oval,
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.920]   I've read all these biographies and like I walk in
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.960]   and I'm like, holy shit.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.840]   You're like, I'm in the Oval Office.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.320]   - Were you interviewing him in the Oval Office?
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.920]   - In the Oval, every time, was in the Oval Office.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.760]   - You scared shitless?
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.640]   Sorry to- - Well, I wasn't scared.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.360]   I was just, look, it's the Oval Office, right?
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.520]   I mean, I'm this nerd.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.600]   He was like this kid.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.080]   I'm so, I will admit this here.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.280]   Like I printed out on my dad's label maker
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.120]   when I was like seven
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.020]   and I wrote like the Oval Office on my bedroom.
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.960]   So I was like a huge nerd,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.680]   like obviously egomaniacal even from seven.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.760]   But so like for this, I mean, it was huge, right?
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.440]   I'm like this 25 year old kid.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.200]   And like, I walk in there and I see the couch, right?
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.360]   And I'm like, oh man, like that's Kissinger.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.260]   Like, you know, I'm like,
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.280]   that's where like Kissinger and Nixon got on their knees.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.880]   And then you see over by the door and you're like,
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.240]   are the scuff marks still there
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.080]   from when Eisenhower used to play golf?
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.520]   You know, this is all running through my mind.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.640]   With Trump, none of it was there.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.480]   None of it, right?
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.040]   So like, even the desk,
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.480]   I put my phone on the desk to record.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.360]   And I'm like, this is the fucking Resolute desk.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.160]   Like I shouldn't put my phone on this thing.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.520]   And I'm like HMS Resolute, you know, all that,
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.360]   you know, national.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.640]   And even for him, he doesn't think about any of it.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.480]   It was like amazing to me.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   Like he had this portrait of Andrew Jackson
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.360]   right next to his, to the, I think from on the fireplace,
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.880]   like right here on the right.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.520]   And the most revealing question was when I was like,
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.280]   Mr. President, what are people gonna remember you
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.520]   for in a hundred years?
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.840]   And he was like, he had, he was like, I don't know,
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.960]   like veterans choice.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.760]   He like has a list in front of him of like
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.120]   his accomplishments, which is staff.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.960]   - Good question by the way.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.080]   - Yeah, well, I mean, that's what I wanted to know.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.920]   And he's like veterans choice.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.480]   And I remember looking at him being like,
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.480]   it's not gonna be veterans.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.320]   (both laughing)
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.720]   You know, I'd be like, I'm like, I'm looking at you,
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.880]   Donald Trump, the harbinger of something new.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.760]   We still don't know what the hell it is.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.480]   And so I realized with these guys
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.960]   and their charisma and more,
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.840]   is that they don't think about themselves
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.280]   the way that we think about them.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.000]   And that was actually important to understand
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.400]   'cause a lot of people are like,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.760]   Trump is playing all this chess.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.200]   I'm like, I assure you, he's not.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.360]   Like he's truly, one time I was interviewing him
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.400]   and he had like a certificate that he had to sign
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.840]   or something on his desk.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.440]   He's like, it was like child almost.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.640]   Like he got distracted by, he's like, oh, what's this?
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.800]   You know, he's just like picking it up.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.720]   And I was like, wow, like this, this is the guy.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.040]   Like, this is what he is.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.240]   - Well, I wonder if there was a different person
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.880]   because you were recording than offline at a bar.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.720]   - I can tell you.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.540]   Well, here's the thing though,
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.360]   because that's another part of it.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.320]   Because that two hours,
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.480]   I would say like half of that was not on the record.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.400]   So like whenever he's off the record,
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.000]   he changes completely, right?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.580]   I don't wanna like go into too much of it or whatever,
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:25.580]   but like he, I mean, he is so mindful
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.120]   of when that camera is on and when the mic is hot
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.840]   in terms of the language that he uses,
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.160]   what he's willing to admit,
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.680]   what he's willing to talk about,
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.740]   how he's willing to even appear in front of his staff.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.160]   I think the most revealing thing Trump ever did
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.920]   was there was this press conference,
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.600]   like right after he lost,
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.240]   right after the midterm elections in 2018.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.520]   And one of the journalists was like,
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.360]   Mr. President, thank you for doing this press conference.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.880]   And he looks at him and he goes, it's called earned media.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.160]   It's worth billions.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.000]   (laughing)
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.600]   He just like had so much disdain for him
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.360]   'cause he's like, I'm not doing this for you.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.880]   He's like, I'm doing this for me.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.280]   - So he's really aware of the narratives and story.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.800]   I mean, people have talked about that all comes
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.680]   from the tabloid media of the, from New York and so on.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.880]   He's a master of that.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.160]   But I've also heard stories of just in private,
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.180]   he's a really, I don't wanna overuse the word charismatic,
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.440]   but just like, he is a really interesting,
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.880]   almost like friendly, like a good person.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.080]   Like that's what I heard.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.760]   I've heard actually surprising the same thing
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.880]   about Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.160]   And like--
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.040]   - That I can't tell you anything about.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.760]   - But like the way they present themselves
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.280]   is perhaps very different than they are as human beings
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.200]   and one-on-one that that's something,
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.600]   maybe that's just like a skill thing.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.720]   Maybe the way they present themselves in public
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.420]   is actually their, I mean, almost their real self.
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.220]   And they're just really good in private, one-on-one
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.800]   to go into this mode of just being really intimate
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.960]   in some kind of human way.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   - I think that's part of it.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.800]   Because I would notice that with Trump,
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   he's like, it's almost like a tour guide.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.240]   It was very like, it's very crazy, right?
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.440]   'Cause you're like, you're in the Oval.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.920]   I mean, it's his office.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.720]   And he's like, do you guys want anything?
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.920]   He's like, you want a Diet Coke?
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.240]   'Cause he drinks like all this Diet Coke.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.080]   - That's awesome.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.920]   - You know what I mean?
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.740]   - Great, I'd apologize.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.680]   - Yeah, he's just like, you guys want a Diet Coke?
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.040]   Right, and you're sitting there and you're like,
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.500]   the way he's able to like,
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.220]   like the last time I interviewed him,
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.220]   he wanted to do it outside
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.300]   because he studied himself from all angles
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.500]   and he knows exactly how he looks on a camera
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.860]   and with which lighting.
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.060]   And so we were supposed to interview him on camera
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.980]   in the Oval Office, which is actually rare.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.660]   Like you don't usually get that.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.380]   And they ended up moving it outside at the last minute.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.420]   And he came out and he's like, I picked this spot for you.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.860]   He's like, great lighting.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.260]   I was like, you are your own lighting director
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.920]   and the president, right?
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.760]   - It was great.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.960]   - It's so funny.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.960]   But it's like you said, he's very charismatic and friendly.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.720]   I mean, you wouldn't know.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.000]   I mean, look, this is what I mean
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.720]   in terms of the dynamism of these people that gets lost.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.280]   And I think even he knows that.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.240]   Like, I don't think he would want that side of him
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.080]   that I see, you know,
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.000]   that you've seen those off the record moments and more
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.360]   in order to come out because he's very keen
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.400]   about how exactly he presents to the public.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.400]   It's like, you know, even his presidential portrait,
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.800]   everybody usually smiles and he refused to smile.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.000]   He was like, I want to look like Winston Churchill.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.400]   You know, like even he knew that.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.440]   - Do you think he believes that he,
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.560]   what he kind of implies that he is one of,
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.000]   if not the greatest presidents in American history?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.820]   Like people kind of laugh at this, but there's quite,
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.420]   I mean, there's quite a lot of people, first of all,
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.080]   that make the argument that he's the greatest president
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.400]   in history.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.460]   Like I've heard this argument being made.
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.740]   And I mean, I don't know what the, first of all,
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:00.740]   I don't care, like you can't make an argument
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.700]   that anyone is the greatest.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.620]   That's just, that's just, I come from a school
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.400]   of like being humble and modest and so on.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.860]   It's like even Michael, you can't have that conversation.
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:12.700]   Okay.
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.500]   So I like that he's humble enough to say like
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.700]   Abraham Lincoln and whatever, like.
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.900]   - He says maybe Lincoln.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.740]   - Maybe. - Remember that.
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.100]   He says maybe Lincoln.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.420]   (laughing)
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.900]   - Do you think he actually believes that
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.740]   or is that something he understands will create news
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.580]   and also perhaps more importantly,
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.600]   piss off a large number of people?
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.860]   Is he almost like a musician masterfully playing
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.360]   the emotions of the public or does he,
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.260]   or/and does he believe when he looks in the mirror,
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.900]   I'm one of the greatest men in history?
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.620]   Combination of all three.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.860]   I do think he believes it.
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.740]   And for the reason why is I don't think he knows
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.940]   that much about US history.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.020]   I really mean that.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.780]   Like, and that's what I meant whenever I was in there
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.220]   and I realized he was just living in the moment.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.780]   I don't think he knew all that much about why.
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.380]   I mean, this is why he was elected in many ways, right?
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.300]   So I'm not saying this is a Norbert,
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.640]   like I'm not making a judgment on this.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.940]   I'm just saying, I do think in his mind,
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.780]   he does think he was one of the best presidents
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.740]   in American history, largely because,
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.520]   and I encountered this with a lot of people who work for him
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.780]   which is that they didn't really know all that much
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.020]   kind of about what came before and all that.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.300]   And it's not necessarily to hold it against them
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.660]   because for in many ways,
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.540]   that's what they were elected to do
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.820]   or elected to be in many ways.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.460]   - It's an interesting question whether knowing history,
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.520]   being a student of history is productive
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.420]   or counterproductive.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.500]   I tend to assume I really respect people
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.580]   who are deeply like well-read in history,
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:51.260]   like presidents that are almost like nerd, history nerds.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.160]   I admire that, but maybe that gets in the way.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.000]   - Well, it's--
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.500]   - Of governance, I don't know.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.120]   It's not, you know, I'm just sort of playing devil's advocate
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.920]   to my own beliefs, but it's possible that focusing
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.760]   on the moment and the issues and letting history,
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.160]   it's like first principles thinking,
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.200]   forget the lessons of the past
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.360]   and just focus on common sense reasoning
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.840]   through the problems of today.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.400]   - Yeah, it's really hard question.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.600]   In terms of the modern era,
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.760]   I mean, Obama was a student of history.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.080]   Like he used to have presidential biographers
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.040]   and people over and I mean, famously,
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.000]   like Robert A. Carrow,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.760]   one of my favorite presidential biographers,
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.320]   he was invited to have dinner with Obama
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.040]   and Obama would like pepper some of his,
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.920]   it was interesting 'cause he'd try and justify
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.800]   some of the things he didn't do by being like,
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.640]   well, if you look at what they had to do
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.360]   and what I have to deal with, mine's much harder.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.040]   So in that way, I was a little pissed off
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.240]   because I'd be like, no, that actually,
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.660]   like you're comparing apples to oranges and all that.
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.720]   But if you look at Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt in particular,
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.560]   this was, I mean, a voracious reader,
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.600]   not of just American history, all history.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.440]   He wrote- - That guy's just
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.240]   such a bad-ass, Jesus. - Incredible.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.120]   The only president who willed himself to greatness,
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.440]   that's like the amazing thing about him.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.380]   He wasn't tested by a crisis, right?
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.680]   Like it wasn't, nah, he didn't have the Civil War,
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.520]   he didn't have World War II,
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.160]   he didn't have to found the country literally,
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.760]   or like didn't have to stave off that,
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.800]   or he didn't buy the Louisiana Purchase, like all that.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.100]   He literally came into a pretty static country
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.840]   and he could have just governed with,
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.120]   I mean, he was the person who came before him
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.660]   was assassinated, like he easily could have coasted,
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.700]   but he literally willed the country into something more.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.640]   And that's always why I focus a lot on him too,
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.600]   'cause I'm like that, in many ways,
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.680]   I wouldn't say it's easy to be great during crisis,
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.520]   I mean, like look at Trump, right?
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.440]   But it can bring out the best within you,
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.200]   but it's a whole other level
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   to bring out the best within yourself
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.720]   just for the sake of doing it.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.440]   And that's, I think is really interesting.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.280]   - His speeches were amazing.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.320]   I'm also a sucker for great speeches
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.440]   'cause I tend to see the role of the president
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.480]   as in part like inspirer and chief,
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.200]   sort of to be able to, I mean, that's what great leaders do,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.280]   like CEOs of companies and so on,
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.180]   establish a vision, a clear vision,
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.840]   and like hit that hard.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.480]   But the way you establish the vision isn't just like,
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:28.460]   not to dig at Joe Biden, but like sleepy, boring statements.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.340]   You have to sell those statements
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.160]   and you have to do it in a way
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.040]   where everybody's paying attention, everybody's excited.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.560]   And that Teddy Roosevelt was definitely one of them.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.080]   Obama was, I think, at least early on,
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.760]   I don't know, was incredible at that.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.920]   It does feel that the modern political landscape
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.880]   makes it more difficult to be inspirational in a sense
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.480]   'cause everything becomes bickering and division.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.760]   I do wanna ask you- - Please.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.680]   - About Trump.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.920]   So you're now a successful podcaster.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.840]   I've talked to Joe about Trump, Joe Rogan,
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.480]   and Joe's not interested in talking to Trump,
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.440]   which is fascinating.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.320]   I try to dig into like why.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.520]   What would you interview Trump on,
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.840]   like realignment, for example?
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.440]   And do you think it's possible to do a two, three hour
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.960]   conversation with him where you will get at something
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.200]   like human or you get at something,
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.000]   like we were talking about the facade he puts forward.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Do you think you could get past that?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.320]   - No, I don't.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.800]   I look, I was a White House correspondent.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.120]   I observed this man very closely.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.400]   I interviewed him.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.440]   I think if that mic is hot, he knows what he's doing.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.120]   He just, he's done this too long, Lex.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:52.960]   He just knows.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.640]   - But do you think he's a different human now
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.160]   after the election?
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.240]   Do you think that- - Yeah, not at all.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.840]   I think he's been the same person since 1976.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:03.760]   I really do.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.000]   Like basically 1976.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.680]   I studied Trump a lot and I think he's basically been
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.840]   the core of who he is and elements of that.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.760]   Ever since he built that, you know,
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.680]   the ice rink in Central Park and got that media attention,
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.520]   that was it.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.040]   - Yeah, he's a fascinating study.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.880]   Still, I feel there's a hope in me
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.560]   that there would be a podcast like Joe Rogan,
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.600]   like a long form podcast where something could be,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.480]   you know, and you're actually a really good person
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.880]   to do that, where you can have a real conversation
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.400]   that looks back at the election and reveals something honest.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.880]   But perhaps he's thinking about running again
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.760]   and so maybe he'll never let down that guard.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.600]   - Yes.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.560]   - But like, you know, I just love it when
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.640]   there's this switch in people where you start
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.880]   looking back at your life and wanting to tell stories.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.320]   Like, you know, trying to extract wisdom
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.640]   and like realizing you're in this new phase of life
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.320]   where like the battles have all been fought.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.360]   Now you're this old, like former warrior
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.480]   and now you can tell the stories of that time.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.720]   And it seems like Trump is still at it,
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.160]   like the young warrior he is.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.400]   He's not in the mode of telling stories.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.600]   - You know what I got from Rogan?
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.720]   He's the only president who didn't age while in office.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   It's true, right?
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.240]   Like, 'cause, and this is what I mean,
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.320]   'cause he lives in the moment.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.920]   Like the job actually aged Obama.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.920]   I mean, Bush, same thing.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.160]   Even Clinton, Clinton was like fat.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.440]   He looked miserable by like 2000.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.840]   HW, like, I mean, Reagan, famous.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.440]   Actually, yeah, pretty much everybody I think about.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.120]   Yeah, including John F. Kennedy
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.720]   who got much sicker while in office.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.320]   The job like weighs on you and makes you physically ill.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.880]   Trump was, he's the only person who just,
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.120]   he didn't have to do it.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.880]   - He almost gotten stronger
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.040]   and he was one of the most divisive,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.240]   like the climate, there's so many people attacking him.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.160]   So much hatred, so much love and hatred.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.920]   And it was just, he, it was, I mean, it was,
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.320]   whatever it was, it was quite masterful
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.880]   and a fascinating study.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.880]   If we stick on Hitler for just a minute,
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.040]   what lessons do you take from that time?
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.440]   Do you think it's a unique moment in human history,
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.040]   that World War II?
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.840]   I mean, both Stalin and Hitler,
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.880]   you know, is it something that's just an outlier
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.480]   in all of human history in terms of the atrocities
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.840]   or is there lessons to be learned?
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.320]   You mentioned offline that you're not just a student
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.440]   of the entirety of the history,
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.120]   but you're also fascinated by just different
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.600]   like policies and stuff.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.160]   Like what's the immigration policy?
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.560]   What's the policy on science?
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.080]   - Well, look, Third Reich in power.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.520]   Let me plug it by Richard Evans, I think is what it was.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.040]   'Cause that actually will tell you,
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.040]   like what was it like to live under the Nazi regime
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.120]   without the war?
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.400]   - Yeah.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.080]   - Yeah, it's a hard question in terms of the lessons
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:08.920]   that we can learn.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.840]   'Cause there's a lot, and it's actually been over,
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.760]   it's been over indexed almost.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.960]   Everything comes back to Hitler in a conversation.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.960]   So I kind of think of it within Mao, Stalin and Hitler
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.900]   as, I don't wanna say payments for,
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.900]   but like the end point payment for the sins
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.060]   and the problems of the monarchical system
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:38.320]   that evolved within Europe, basically like 1400 and more.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.160]   I basically think that 1400, the wars between the state,
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.560]   wars between France, England, the balance of power,
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.440]   eventually World War I, and then serfdom within Russia,
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.120]   the Russian revolution that birthed Stalin,
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.080]   same thing, the Kaiser and Imperial Germany
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.460]   and this like incredibly crazy system of balance of power
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.780]   in World War I.
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.700]   And then same thing within China
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.620]   in terms of the warring states
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.980]   and then the disintegration, the European,
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.520]   this is how they think of it,
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.460]   which is like the century of humiliation
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.740]   and they had to have something like this.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.060]   I think of it, I try to think of it
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.660]   within the context of that.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.900]   I don't wanna think of,
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.060]   I don't wanna sound like an inevitable list,
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.920]   but I think of it as, I like to think about systems,
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.160]   especially in here in DC, that's where I got into politics,
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.480]   which is that you have to understand systems of power
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.000]   and the incentives within systems and the disincentives,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.840]   the downside risk of what you're creating,
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:41.840]   because that is what leads and creates the behavior
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.160]   within that system.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.880]   I was just talking to my girlfriend about this yesterday.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.920]   It's kind of funny, like I read these,
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.900]   I'm obsessed with these books by Robert Caro,
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.380]   the biographies of Lyndon Johnson.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.220]   He's written like 5,000 pages so far
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.460]   and it's still not done.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.280]   Okay, so like these are like books I base my life on.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.620]   And look, these are Washington
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.480]   and the story of the post New Deal era and forward.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.760]   Not much has changed.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.000]   Like the Senate is still the Senate.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.840]   So many of the same problems with the Senate
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.300]   are still there in some cases.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.460]   No, not anymore.
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.100]   But for a while, some of the people
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.800]   who were there with Johnson are actually still.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.460]   One of them is the president of the United States,
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.540]   just a joke.
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.780]   And you think about also same
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.300]   with the media relationship, right?
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.740]   Like there's this media really,
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.260]   they may have come and gone.
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.780]   Like the people who were in the media
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.900]   and who were cozy with the administration officials.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.220]   I mean, they just recreated themselves.
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:41.020]   It's like an ecosystem which doesn't change.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.260]   And that's why I'm like,
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.180]   oh, it's not that was a specific time.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.380]   That's just DC.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.900]   Like that is DC
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.980]   because of the way the system is architected.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.560]   It's pretty much been that way since like 1908,
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.300]   whenever like Teddy Roosevelt was dining
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.920]   with these journalists and he would yell at them.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.560]   And then he would go over to the society house.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.120]   And like in many ways,
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.580]   that's now instead of going to Henry Adams's house,
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.420]   like the people are congregating in Calorama,
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.120]   which is the richest neighborhood here
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.300]   at somebody else's house.
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.900]   Like it's the same thing.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.540]   So you have to think about the system
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.660]   and then the incentives within that system
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.540]   about what the outcomes that they're producing.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.860]   If you actually wanna think about
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.760]   how can I change this from the outside?
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.680]   That's also why it's very difficult to change
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.660]   because the system is designed
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.040]   in order to produce actually pretty specific outcomes
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.800]   that can only be changed in extraordinary times.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.340]   - Yeah, it's sometimes hard to predict
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.280]   what kind of outcomes will result from the incentive,
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.980]   the system that you create, right?
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.380]   In the case, because especially when it's novel
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:46.500]   kind of situations.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.300]   Trump actually created a pretty novel situation.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.580]   And a lot of the things that we've seen
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.380]   in the 20th century were very novel systems
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.800]   where people were very optimistic about the outcomes, right?
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.780]   And then it turned out to not have the results
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.060]   that they predicted.
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.580]   In terms of like things being unchanged
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.460]   for the past 100 years and so on,
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   can you like Wikipedia style or maybe like in a musical form,
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.020]   like I'm only a bill, describe to me.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.760]   (laughing)
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.640]   - I still sing that to my head sometimes.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.960]   I'm just a bill.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.200]   (laughing)
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.160]   - I don't know what the rest of the song is,
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.400]   but let's leave that to people's imagination.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.000]   How does this whole thing work?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   How does the US political system work?
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.160]   The three branches.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.760]   How do you think about the system we have now?
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.520]   If you were to try to describe,
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.320]   if aliens showed up and asked you like,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.760]   they didn't have time, so this is an elevator thing.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:54.760]   Should we destroy you as you plead to avoid destruction?
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.680]   Well, how would you describe how this thing works?
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.600]   - I would say we come together
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.740]   and we pick the people who make our laws.
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.900]   Then we pick the guy who executes those laws
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.380]   and they together pick the people who determine
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.900]   whether they or the president is breaking the law
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.360]   at the most basic level.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.860]   That's how I would describe it.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:22.620]   The people who make the laws are Congress.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:27.620]   The executive is charged with executing the laws
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.260]   as passed by Congress, the branches of government.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.140]   And the Supreme Court is picked by the president,
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.780]   confirmed by the Senate, which then decides
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.420]   whether you or other people are breaking the law
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.000]   in terms of interpretation of that law.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.840]   That's basically it.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:47.840]   Oh, and they decide whether those laws are in,
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.980]   they fall within the restrictions
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.860]   and the want of the founders as expressed
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.820]   by the constitution of the United States,
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.820]   which is a set of principles that we came together in 1787.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.300]   I wanna make sure I get this right.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.660]   1787 and decided that we were gonna live
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.740]   the rest of our lives barring a revolution and more.
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.900]   And we've made it 200 and something years
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.660]   in order on under that system.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.420]   - So there's a balance of power
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.460]   that is because it's multiple branches.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.940]   There's a tension and a balance to it
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.980]   as designed by those original documents.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.420]   Which is the most dysfunctional?
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.260]   Which is the branches?
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.740]   Which is your favorite?
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.880]   Like in terms of talking about systems
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.340]   and like what's the greatest of concern
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:41.540]   and what is the greatest source of benefit in your view?
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.780]   - The presidency, obviously.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:46.500]   Well, the presidency is my favorite to study, obviously,
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.940]   because it is the one where there's most subject
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.460]   to variable change in terms of the personality involved
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:56.860]   because of so much power imbued within the executive.
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.460]   The Senate is actually pretty much the same.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.660]   (laughs)
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.820]   One of the things I love about reading about the Senate
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.740]   and histories of the Senate is you're like,
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.740]   oh yeah, there were always like assholes in the Senate
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:13.220]   who were doing their thing and filibustering constantly
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.320]   based upon this or that.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.500]   And then the personalities involved with the Senate
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:23.500]   haven't mattered as much since like pre-Civil War.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.980]   Like pre-Civil War you had like Henry Clay
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.980]   and then Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun,
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.220]   who even in their own way,
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.180]   they represented like larger constituencies
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.340]   and they crafted these like compromises
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.860]   up until the outbreak of the Civil War, et cetera.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.140]   But like post since then,
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.720]   you don't think about like the Titans within the Senate.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.620]   Most of that is because a lot of the stuff
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.660]   that they had power over
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.720]   has transferred over to the executive.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.040]   So I'm most interested in really in like power,
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.020]   like where it lies.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.720]   It's actually pretty, you know,
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.900]   throughout American history,
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.940]   much more used to lie with Congress.
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.440]   Now it's obviously just so imbued within the executive
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.340]   that understanding executive power
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.940]   is I think the thing I'm probably most interested in here.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.340]   - Do you think at this point,
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.340]   the amount of power that the president has is corrupting
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.700]   to their ability to lead well?
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.140]   Is this, you know, power corrupts,
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.340]   absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:21.500]   Are we, is there too much power in the presidency?
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.540]   - There definitely is.
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.820]   And part of the problem,
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:27.740]   and one of the things I try to make come across to people
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.740]   is if you're the president,
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:34.020]   unless you have a hyper intentional view
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.740]   of how something must be different in government,
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.920]   your view doesn't matter.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.140]   So for example, like if you were Trump,
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.100]   let's take Trump even,
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.580]   and even in with a pretty intentional view,
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.080]   he was like, I'm gonna end the war in Afghanistan
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.380]   and Iraq, right?
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.500]   And he came in and he gets these generals in.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.420]   He's like, I wanna end the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.780]   Oh, and I wanna withdraw these troops from Syria.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.300]   And they're like, okay, well give us like six months.
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.140]   He's like, okay.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:58.980]   And this is the thing about Trump,
[00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.580]   he doesn't realize that it's bullshit.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.260]   So they're like, he's like, six months seems fine.
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.940]   Right, so then six months comes and he's like,
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.540]   he's like, so, and then he'll announce it.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.140]   He'll be like, and we're getting out of Syria, it's great.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.700]   And then the generals freak out.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.740]   They're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:13.660]   We don't have a plan for that.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.100]   He's like, but you guys told me six months.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.700]   He's like, I don't know, now we need another six months
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.340]   in order to figure this thing out.
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.020]   And by that time, now you're midterms.
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:20.860]   So now what?
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.140]   You gotta run for re-election.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.540]   So more what I mean by that is,
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.020]   if you don't have a hyper-intentional view
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.540]   about how to change foreign policy,
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.980]   if you don't have a hyper-intentional view
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.300]   about how the Department of Commerce should do its job,
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.160]   they are just gonna go on autopilot.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.740]   So this is part of the problem.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.260]   When you asked me about the presidency,
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.080]   it's not the presidency itself,
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.100]   like the president himself, which has become too powerful.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.620]   It's that we have less democratic checks
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:51.540]   on the people and the systems that are on autopilot.
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:55.040]   And I would say that basically since 2008,
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:01.840]   we have voted every single time to disrupt that system,
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.300]   except in the case of 2020 with Joe Biden,
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.420]   and there are a lot of different reasons
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.980]   around why that happened.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.260]   And in every single one of those cases,
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.460]   Obama and Trump, they all failed
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.960]   in order to radically disrupt that.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.620]   And that just shows you how titanic the task is.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.860]   And I'm using my language precisely,
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.380]   'cause I don't wanna be like deep state,
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.980]   but obviously there's a deep state.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.460]   - Deep state, I guess, has conspiratorial
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.100]   - Exactly. - Tensions to it.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.340]   But so what you're saying is the true power
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.500]   currently lies with the autopilot,
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.740]   - Yeah. - AKA deep state.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.940]   - Well, but see, it's not, this is the thing too
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.420]   I wanna make clear, 'cause I think people
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.140]   think conspiratorially that they're all coming together
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.220]   to intentionally do something.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.260]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.480]   They are doing what they know, believe they are right,
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.720]   and don't have real democratic checks within that.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.440]   And so now they have entire generations of cultures
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.960]   within each of these bureaucracies where they say,
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.560]   this is the way that we do things around here.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.840]   And that's the problem, which is that we have a culture
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.960]   of within many of these agencies and more.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.080]   I think the best example for this
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:13.940]   would be during the Ukraine gate with Trump and all that,
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:14.780]   with the impeachment.
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.540]   I don't wanna, I'm not talking about the politics here,
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.980]   but the most revealing thing that happened
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.960]   was when the whistleblower guy, Alexander Vindman,
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.220]   was like, "Here you have the president
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:27.140]   "departing from the policy of the United States."
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:32.140]   And I was like, "Well, let me educate you, Lieutenant Colonel
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.520]   "the president of the United States
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.100]   "makes American foreign policy."
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.140]   - Yeah. - But it was a very
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:41.240]   revealing comment because he and all the people
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.040]   within national security bureaucracy do think that.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.520]   They're like, "This is the policy of the United States.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.160]   "We have to do this."
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.440]   That's where things get screwy.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.060]   - Well, listen, for me personally,
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.200]   but also from an engineering perspective,
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.480]   I just talked to Jim Keller, it's just,
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.000]   this is the kind of bullshit that we all hate
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.080]   in when you're trying to innovate
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.360]   and design new products. - Right.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.840]   - So that's what first principles thinking requires
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.080]   is like, we don't give a shit what was done before.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.640]   The point is, what is the best way to do it?
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.960]   And it seems like the current government,
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.280]   government in general, probably,
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.440]   bureaucracies in general are just really good
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.560]   at being lazy about never having those conversations.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.520]   And just, it becomes this momentum thing
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.080]   that nobody has the difficult conversations.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.520]   It's become a game within a certain set of constraints.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.880]   And they never kind of do revolutionary tasks.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.920]   - But you did say that the presidency is power,
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.500]   but you're saying that more power than the others,
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.760]   but that power has to be coupled
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.440]   with focused intentionality.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.480]   Like, you have to keep hammering the thing.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.080]   - If you want it done, it has to be done.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.200]   I mean, and you gotta, this is the other part too,
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.740]   which is that it's not just that you have to get it done,
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.760]   you have to pick the 100 people who you can trust
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.680]   to pick 10 people each to actually do what you want.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.800]   One of the most revealing quotes
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.640]   is from a guy named Tommy Corcoran.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.000]   He was the top aid to FDR.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.880]   This I'm getting from the Cara books too.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.200]   And he said, "What is a government?
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.720]   "It's not just one guy or even 10 guys.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.400]   "Hell, it's a thousand guys."
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:28.200]   And what FDR did is he masterfully picked the right people
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.080]   to execute his will through the federal agencies.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.640]   Johnson was the same way.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.760]   He played these people like a fiddle.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.480]   He knew exactly who to pick.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.000]   He knew the system and more.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.760]   Part of the reason that outsiders
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.240]   who don't have a lot of experience in Washington
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.900]   almost always fail is they don't know who to pick
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.200]   or they pick people who say one thing to their face.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.480]   And then when it comes time to carry out
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.280]   the president's policy in terms of the government,
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.320]   they just don't do it.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.240]   And the president's too, think about this.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.880]   I think Rahm Emanuel said this.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.680]   He was like, "By the time it gets to the president's desk,
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.920]   "nobody else can solve it."
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.760]   It's not easy.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.640]   It's not like a yes or no question.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.760]   It's every single thing that hits the president's desk
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.780]   is incredibly hard to do.
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.840]   And Obama actually even said,
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.040]   and this was a very revealing quote
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.520]   about how he thinks about the presidency,
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.360]   which is he's like,
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.960]   "Look, the presidency is like one of those super tankers."
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.460]   He's like, "I can come in
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.340]   "and I can take it two degrees left and two degrees right.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.620]   "In 100 years, two degrees left,
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.780]   "that's a whole different trajectory.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:32.920]   "Same thing on the right."
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.960]   And he's like, "That ultimately is really all you can do."
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.760]   I quibble and disagree with that
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.480]   in terms of how he could have changed things in 2008,
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.680]   but there's a lot of truth to that statement.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.600]   - Okay, that's really fascinating.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.760]   You make me realize that actually both Obama and Trump
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.160]   are probably playing victim here to the system.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.800]   You're making me think that maybe you can correct me
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.280]   that, 'cause I'm thinking of like Elon Musk,
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.560]   whose major success, despite everything,
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.440]   is hiring the right people.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.280]   - Exactly.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.960]   - And like creating those thousands,
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.540]   that structure of a thousand people.
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.280]   So maybe a president has power in that
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.880]   if they were exceptionally good at hiring the right people.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.280]   - Personnel is policy, man.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.640]   That's what it comes down to.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.520]   - But wouldn't you be able to steer the ship
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.340]   way more than two degrees if you hire the right people?
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.160]   So like, it's almost like Obama
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.240]   was not good at hiring the right people.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.920]   He hired all the Clinton people.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.760]   That's what happened.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.580]   What happened with Trump?
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:29.520]   He hired all the Bush people.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.600]   Weird. - And then you just sit back
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.800]   and say, "Oh, president can't,"
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.320]   but that means you're just suck at hiring.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.160]   - Correct.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.000]   Yeah, I mean, look, it's funny.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.680]   I'm giving you simultaneously
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.880]   the nationalist case against Trump
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.120]   and the progressive case against Obama.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.180]   The progressive people were like,
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.920]   "Why the fuck are you hiring all these Clinton people
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.800]   "in order to run the government and just recreate,
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.720]   "like why are you hiring Larry Summers,
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.240]   "who was one of the people who worked at all these banks
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.360]   "and didn't believe that bailouts were gonna be big enough,
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.120]   "and then to come in in the worst economic crisis
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.560]   "in modern American history?"
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.720]   That was 2008.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.520]   And Summers actively lobbied against larger bailouts,
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.960]   which had huge implications for working class people
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.440]   and pretty much hollowed out America since.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.160]   Okay, from Trump, same thing.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.920]   You're like, "I'm gonna drain the swamp.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.840]   "And by doing that, I'm gonna hire
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.160]   "Goldman Sachs' Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.840]   "and all these other absolute Bush clowns
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.700]   "in order to run my White House."
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.340]   Well, yeah, no shit.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.140]   The only thing that you accomplished
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.760]   in your four years in office
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.840]   is passing a massive tax cut for the rich
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.320]   and for corporations.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.840]   I wonder how that happened.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.320]   - What role does money play in all of this?
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.640]   Is money a huge influence in politics,
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.480]   super PACs, all that kind of stuff?
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.240]   Or is this more just kind of a narrative that we play with?
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.040]   Because from the outsider's perspective,
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.840]   that seems to be one of the fundamental problems
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   with modern politics.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.520]   - So I was just having this conversation,
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:41:59.840]   Marshall and I, Marshall Kass,
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.220]   one of my co-hosts on the realignment.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.560]   And it's funny because if you do enough research,
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.360]   we actually live in the least corrupt age
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.880]   in American campaign finance.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.680]   As in, it's never been more transparent.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.480]   It's never been more up to the FEC,
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.340]   yeah, and all of that.
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.960]   If you go back and read not even 50 years ago,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.520]   we're talking about Lyndon B. Johnson handing people,
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.600]   like literally as he came up in his youth,
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.160]   paying people for votes,
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:33.160]   like the boss of the person who had all the Mexican votes,
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.120]   like the person who had,
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.760]   and he was giving out briefcases.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.580]   This is it, like within people's lifetimes
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.960]   who are alive in America.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.480]   So that doesn't happen anymore.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:44.480]   But I don't like to blame everything on money,
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.280]   although I do think money is obviously
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.440]   a huge part of the problem.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.800]   I actually look at it in terms of distribution,
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.400]   which is that how is money distributed within our society?
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.520]   'Cause I firmly believe that politics,
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.760]   this is gonna get complicated,
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.480]   but I think politics is mostly downstream from culture.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.880]   And culture, obviously I'm using economics
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.380]   because there's obviously a huge interplay there.
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.880]   But like in terms of the equitable
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.720]   or lack of equitable distribution of money
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.840]   within our politics,
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.040]   what we're really pissed off about is we're like,
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.140]   our politics only seems to work
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.120]   for the people who have money.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.000]   I think that's largely true.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.640]   I think that the reason why things worked differently
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.740]   in the past is because our economy was structured
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.880]   in different ways.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.660]   And there's a reason that our politics today
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:34.360]   are very analogous to the last Gilded Age,
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:39.360]   because we had very similar levels of economic distribution
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.160]   and cultural problems too at the same time.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.000]   I don't wanna erase that,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.640]   'cause I actually think that's what's driving
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.020]   all of our politics right now.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:45.860]   - So that's interesting.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.160]   So seeing as one, so in that sense,
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.240]   representative government is doing a pretty good job
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   of representing the state of culture
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.600]   and the people and so on.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:58.480]   Yeah, can I ask you in terms of the deep state
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.560]   and conspiracy theories, there's a lot of talk about,
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.440]   so again, from an outsider's perspective,
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.360]   if I were just looking at Twitter,
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.440]   it seems that at least 90% of people in government
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.280]   are pedophiles.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.120]   (laughing)
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:15.200]   90 to 95%, I'm not sure what that number is.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.960]   If I were to just look at Twitter, honestly, or YouTube,
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:20.640]   I would think most of the world is a pedophile.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.060]   I would almost feel like--
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.320]   - Right, and if you don't fully believe that,
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.160]   you're a pedophile.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.340]   (laughing)
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:31.080]   - I would start to wonder, like, wait, am I a pedophile too?
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.080]   I'm either a communist or a pedophile, or both, I guess.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.480]   Yeah, that's gonna be clipped out, thank you, internet.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.420]   (laughing)
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.180]   I look forward to your emails.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:47.180]   - But is there any kind of shadow conspiracy theories
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.500]   that give you pause?
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.620]   Or, so the flip side, the response to a lot
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:57.460]   of conspiracy theories is like, no, the reason this happened
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:01.800]   is because it's a combination of just incompetence.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.380]   So where do you land on some of these conspiracy theories?
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.100]   - I think most conspiracy theories are wrong.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.980]   Some are true, and those are spectacularly true.
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.620]   And, if that makes sense.
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:16.780]   - Yeah, and we don't know which ones, though.
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:17.660]   - I don't know which ones.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:18.620]   - That's the problem.
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.320]   - I think, oh, well, I mean, look, man,
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.580]   I listened to your podcast.
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:25.540]   I think I was a huge non-believer in UFOs,
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.300]   and now I've probably never believed more in UFOs.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.860]   Like, I believe in UFOs.
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.840]   Like, I'm very comfortable being like,
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.340]   not only do I believe in UFOs,
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.740]   like, I think we're probably being visited
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.620]   by an alien civilization.
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.540]   And if you asked me that three years ago,
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:40.980]   I would've been like, you're out of your fucking mind.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.220]   Like, what are you talking about?
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:44.020]   Well, listen to David Fravor.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:44.900]   That's all I have to say.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:45.740]   That's it.
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:49.140]   - I have the sense that the government has information
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:52.140]   that hasn't revealed, but it's not like they're,
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.740]   I don't think they're holding,
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.780]   there's like a green guy sitting there in a room.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:56.620]   - Exactly.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.100]   - They just, they have seen things
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.780]   they don't know what to do with,
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.460]   so it's like, they're confused.
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.420]   - They're afraid of revealing that they don't know.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.260]   That's what I think it is.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:06.100]   - They don't know, right.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.100]   - It's revealing, yeah, exactly, that they don't know.
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.700]   And then in the process,
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.380]   there's a lot of fears tied up in that.
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.220]   First, looking incompetent in the public eye,
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.700]   nobody wants to be looked that way.
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.360]   And the other is like, in revealing it,
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.020]   even though they don't know,
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.300]   maybe China will figure it out.
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:24.140]   - Exactly.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.780]   - So like, we don't want China to figure it out first.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.980]   And so that, all those kinds of things
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.580]   result in basically secrecy,
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.340]   then that damages the trust in institutions
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:36.740]   on one of the most fascinating aspects,
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.980]   like one of the most fascinating mysteries of humankind
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:44.780]   of is there life, intelligent life out there in the universe?
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.540]   So that's one of them, but there's other ones.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:49.660]   Like for me, when I first came across,
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:53.420]   actually, Alex Jones was 9/11.
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:54.260]   - Yeah.
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.780]   - I remember like, 'cause I was in Chicago,
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.220]   I was thinking like, oh shit,
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.420]   are they gonna hit Chicago too?
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.340]   - That's what everybody was thinking.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.900]   - Yeah, everybody was thinking like,
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.100]   what does this mean?
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:05.940]   What scale?
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.660]   What, I mean, trying to interpret it.
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.340]   And I remember like, looking for information,
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.380]   desperately, like what happened?
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.420]   And I remember not being satisfied
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:17.140]   with the quality of reporting
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:18.820]   and figuring out like, rigorous,
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.460]   like, here's exactly what happened.
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:23.660]   And so people like Alex Jones stepped up
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.900]   and others that said like,
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.940]   there's some shady shit going on.
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.620]   And it sure as hell looked like
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:30.900]   there's shady shit going on.
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:31.860]   - Yes.
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.740]   - So like, and I still stand behind the fact
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:38.580]   that it seems like there's not enough,
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:40.580]   like it wasn't a good job of being honest
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.140]   and transparent and all those kinds of things.
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:43.980]   - 'Cause it would implicate the Saudis, let's be honest.
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:44.820]   - Is it?
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.220]   - That's my conspiracy theories.
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.180]   I'm like, yeah, I think they covered up a lot of stuff
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.540]   because they wanted to cover up
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:50.820]   for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.500]   Like, I mean, that was a conspiracy theory
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.460]   not that long ago.
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.340]   I think it's true.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.180]   I mean, I don't think it's 100% true.
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.180]   - Yeah, so those kinds of conspiracy theories
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.020]   are interesting.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:01.780]   I mean, there's other ones for me personally
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.340]   that touched sort of the institution
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:09.340]   that means a lot to me is MIT and Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:10.660]   - I wanna hear a lot more.
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:11.620]   I wanna hear about that.
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:12.780]   I talk about Epstein a lot.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:13.660]   So I'm like- - Oh, you do?
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.700]   - Yeah, and he, I was gonna say,
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:16.980]   in terms of conspiracy theory,
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:18.780]   that one changed my outlook.
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:22.420]   'Cause I was like, whoa, like, you know this dude
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:26.620]   who convinced some of the most successful people on earth
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.100]   that he was like some money manager
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.140]   and it looks like it was totally fake.
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.300]   Like Leon Black.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.300]   I mean, this is one of the richest men on Wall Street,
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.740]   $9 billion net worth.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:40.100]   Why is he giving him over $100 million
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.460]   between 2015 and 2019?
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:43.860]   What's going on here?
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.340]   Lex Wexner, same thing.
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.300]   So yeah, I wanna hear
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.540]   because you know people who met him.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.860]   And the only person I know who met him was Eric Weinstein.
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.180]   I've heard his, right?
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.180]   - Oh boy, so I, listen, I'm still in,
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:56.620]   and Eric is fascinating.
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.820]   And like Eric is full on saying that-
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.700]   - He was a Mossad or whatever.
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.180]   - Yeah, there's a front for something,
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.980]   something much, much bigger.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.700]   And there's a, whatever his name, Robert Maxwell,
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:12.100]   all those stories.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.060]   Like you could dig deeper and deeper
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.540]   that Jeffrey's just like the tip of the iceberg.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:20.660]   I just think he's an exceptionally charismatic,
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.780]   listen, this isn't speaking from confidence
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.740]   or like deep understanding of the situation,
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.380]   but from my speaking with people,
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:33.380]   he just seems like, at least from the side of his influence
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:36.820]   and interaction with researchers,
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.340]   he just seems like somebody
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:40.060]   that was exceptionally charismatic
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:44.780]   and actually took interest.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:49.780]   He was unable to speak about interesting scientific things,
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.940]   but he took interest in them.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.940]   So he knew how to stroke the egos
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:56.240]   of a lot of powerful people like well,
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.500]   like in different kinds of ways.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:01.220]   I suppose, I don't know about this
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.180]   because I don't have, like if a really,
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.020]   okay, this is weird to say,
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:10.060]   but I have an ability, okay,
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.740]   I think women are beautiful, I like women,
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.300]   but like if like a supermodel came to me or something,
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.300]   like I'm able to reason.
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.700]   It seems like some people are not able to think clearly
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.260]   when there's like an attractive woman in the room.
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.480]   And I think that was one of the tools
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.400]   he used to manipulate people.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.300]   - Interesting.
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.500]   - I don't know.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.620]   Listen, it's like the pedophile thing.
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.880]   I don't know how many people are complete sex addicts,
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:39.680]   but like it seems like, like looking out into the world,
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.720]   like there's like the Me Too movement
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.680]   have revealed that there's a lot of like weird,
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.240]   like creepy people out there.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.520]   I don't know, but I think it was just one of the many tools
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:55.520]   that he used to convince people and manipulate people,
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:01.420]   but not in some like evil way,
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:07.040]   but more just really good at the art of conversation
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.840]   and just winning people over on the side.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.700]   And then by building through that process,
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.120]   building a network of other really powerful people
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:21.120]   and not explicitly, but implicitly having done shady shit
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:26.340]   with powerful people, like building up
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:31.340]   a kind of implied power of like,
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:34.700]   like we did some shady shit together,
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.740]   so we're not like, you're gonna help me out
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.600]   on this extra thing I need to do now.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.000]   And that builds and builds and builds
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.700]   to where you're able to actually control,
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.460]   like have quite a lot of power
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:50.140]   without explicitly having like a strategy meeting.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:53.060]   And I think a single person or,
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:55.940]   yeah, I think a single person can do that,
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:58.140]   can start that ball rolling.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:00.620]   And over time it becomes a group thing.
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:05.220]   Like I don't know if Julian Maxwell was involved or others.
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:08.020]   And yeah, over time that becomes almost
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:11.580]   like a really powerful organization that wasn't,
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:14.540]   that's not a front for something much deeper
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.580]   and bigger, but it's almost like,
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:19.580]   maybe it's 'cause I love cellular automata, man.
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:22.140]   A system that starts out as a simple thing
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:25.380]   with simple rules can create incredible complexity.
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:29.540]   And so I just think that we're now looking in retrospect,
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.780]   it looks like an incredibly complex system
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.860]   that's operating, but like, that's just because it's,
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.340]   you know, there could be a lot of other Jeffrey Epstein's
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.980]   in my perspective that this simple thing
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:43.020]   just was successful early on and builds and builds
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.580]   and builds and builds.
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:47.820]   And then there's a creepy shit that like a lot of aspects
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:50.940]   of the system helped it get bigger and bigger
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:52.460]   and more powerful and so on.
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.940]   So the final result is, I mean,
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.780]   listen, I have a pretty optimistic,
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.980]   I have a, I tend to see the good in people.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.220]   And so it's been heartbreaking to me in general,
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:08.540]   just to see, you know, people I look up to
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:12.020]   not have the level of integrity I thought they would,
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.060]   or like the strength of character,
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.340]   all those kinds of things.
[00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:20.340]   And it seems like you should be able to see the bullshit
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.940]   that is Jeffrey Epstein, like when you meet him.
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.780]   We're not talking about like Eric Weinstein,
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:28.700]   like one or two or three or five interactions,
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.820]   but like there's people that had like years
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:33.700]   of relationship with him.
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.820]   And I don't know, I'm not sure.
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.900]   - Even after he was convicted.
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:37.740]   - After he was convicted.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.700]   - That's the thing, that guy always gets me.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:41.040]   - Yeah, there's stories.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.700]   I mean, I don't need to sort of,
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:46.260]   I honestly believe,
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:52.180]   okay, here's the open question I have.
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:55.740]   I don't know how many creepy sexual people
[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:57.100]   that are out there.
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:00.180]   Like, I don't know if there's like,
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:03.420]   like the people I know, the faculty and so on,
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:05.300]   I don't know if they have like a kink
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.300]   that I'm just not aware of that was being leveraged.
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:13.000]   Because to me, it seems like if people aren't,
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.600]   if not everybody's a pedophile,
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:18.600]   then it's just the art of conversation.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:22.000]   That is just like the art of just like manipulating people
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.120]   by making them feel good about like the exciting stuff
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:25.960]   they're doing.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:28.560]   Listen, man, academics, people talk about money.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.400]   I don't think academics care about money
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.560]   as much as people think.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.720]   What they care about is like somebody,
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.840]   they want to be, it's the same thing
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.020]   that Instagram models post in their butt pictures,
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:42.660]   is they want to be loved.
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:43.780]   They want attention.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:44.780]   - My parents are professors.
[00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:45.620]   Yeah, I get it.
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.020]   (both laughing)
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.540]   - And Jeffrey Epstein,
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:52.420]   the money is another way to show attention.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.220]   - Right, it's a proxy.
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:55.540]   - Mind work matters.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:55:00.540]   And he, for some, he did that for some of the weirdest,
[00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.660]   most brilliant people.
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:04.620]   I don't want to sort of drop names,
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:06.180]   but everybody knows them.
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:09.900]   It's like people that are the most interesting academics
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.460]   is the one he cared about.
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:12.940]   Like people that are thinking about
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:16.060]   the most difficult questions in all of science
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:16.940]   and all of engineering.
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:21.140]   So those people were kind of outcasts in academia
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:23.220]   a little bit because they're doing the weird shit.
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:24.500]   They're the weirdos.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.040]   And he cared about the weirdos and he gave them money.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:32.040]   And that's, I don't know if there's something
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.980]   more nefarious than that.
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:36.620]   I hope not, but maybe I'm surprised.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:38.660]   And in fact, half the population of the world
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:39.620]   is pedophiles.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.340]   - No, I think it's what you were talking about,
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:46.340]   which is that it's the implication after the initial,
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.740]   right, like you do some shady things together,
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:51.220]   or you do something that you want out of the public eye
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.420]   and you're a public person.
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.320]   And look, we probably even experience this
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.420]   to a limited extent, right?
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:57.580]   You're like, ah, you know, like, I don't want to,
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:59.340]   I don't know, I almost lost my temper, you know,
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:00.880]   one time whenever a car hit me and I'm like,
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.420]   I can't freak out in public anymore.
[00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:04.060]   I'm like, you know, like what if somebody
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.340]   takes a photo or something?
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:08.240]   And so I think that there's an extent of that
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.020]   times a billion, literally,
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.220]   when you have a billion dollars or more.
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:13.380]   And you take that all together
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.020]   and you stack it up on itself.
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.860]   I saw a story about like Bill Clinton.
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:20.340]   Like Bill Clinton was with Epstein or with Ghislaine Maxwell
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:23.100]   in a private air terminal or something.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.460]   And she had one of their like sex, you know,
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:28.160]   one of those girls who was underage,
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:31.120]   had her dressed up in a literal like pilot uniform.
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.980]   And she was underage in order to, you know,
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:37.540]   and she was being disguised for being older.
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.060]   And she was a masseuse, right?
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:41.620]   Because that was one of the guises which they got
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:43.420]   in order to sexually traffic these women.
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.700]   And she was like, Bill was like complaining about his neck.
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.740]   And she's like, give Bill Clinton a massage, right?
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.420]   So now there's a photo of an underage girl
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.360]   giving a massage to the former president
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.740]   of the United States.
[00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.620]   I don't think he knew, right?
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.680]   But like, that looks bad.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.060]   And so this is kind of what we're getting at,
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.020]   which is that you're setting it all up
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.000]   and creating those preconditions.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.480]   Or like Prince Andrew, do I think Prince Andrew knew
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:08.800]   that Virginia Gouffre was underage?
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:10.060]   I don't know.
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.520]   He probably knew she was pretty young,
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.120]   which I think is, you know, skeevy enough
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.880]   where you're a fucking prince, you probably know better.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.760]   But I don't think he knew she was underage.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:19.600]   Or maybe he did.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.240]   And if he did, then he's even more of a piece of shit
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.080]   than I thought.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.620]   But when we look at these things,
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:26.960]   the stuff I'm more interested in
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.400]   is like what you were talking about.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.920]   I'm like, Bill Gates?
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:33.280]   How do you get the richest man in the world in your house?
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.600]   Like under what, and Gates is like,
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.200]   he was talking about financing and all this.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.300]   I'm like, you don't have access to money or bankers?
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:42.640]   Like you're the richest man in the world.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.280]   Like you can call Goldman Sachs
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.340]   anytime you want on a hotline.
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:49.680]   Like why do you need, that's where I start again
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.740]   to get more conspiratorial because I'm like,
[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:55.040]   Bill, dude, you have the gold credit, right?
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.280]   Like you don't need Epstein
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.380]   to create some complicated financing structure.
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:04.320]   Or Leon Black, like what is 2015, 2009?
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:06.040]   I mean, this is very recent stuff.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:08.080]   Or, and this is the part that really got me
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:10.520]   is I read the, I think it's called
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.280]   the Department of Financial Service report
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.600]   around Deutsche Bank with Epstein.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.900]   They knew he was a criminal.
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.640]   They solicited his business.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.320]   Explicitly knew that his business
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.760]   meant access to other high net worth individuals.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.120]   Consistently doled money out from his account
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:31.260]   for hush payments to women in Europe and prostitution rings.
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.580]   They knew all of this within the bank.
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.580]   It was elevated multiple times.
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.580]   Here was the other one.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.260]   One of Epstein's associates was like,
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.060]   hey, how much money can we take out
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:42.580]   before we hit the automatic sensor,
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:44.780]   before you have to tell the IRS?
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:47.980]   And that question by their own standards
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:51.380]   is supposed to result in a notification to the feds
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:52.300]   and they never did it.
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.940]   And he was withdrawing like $2 million of cash
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:57.160]   in five years for tips.
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:00.400]   I'm like, okay, something's going on here.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.240]   - Yeah. - You see what I'm saying?
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.800]   - There's a lot of signs that make you think
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:08.120]   that there's a bigger thing at play than just the man.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:11.640]   That there is some, it does look like
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:15.200]   a larger organization is using this front, right?
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.080]   - Again, I don't know.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.400]   I truly don't know.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.120]   And I'm not willing to use the certainty,
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:20.640]   which I think a lot of people online are,
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.360]   to say like it was 100%.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.480]   - The certainty is always the problem.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:28.540]   That's probably why I hesitate to touch conspiracy theories
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:31.660]   is 'cause I'm allergic to certainty in all forms.
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:33.420]   In politics, any kind of discourse.
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:37.860]   And people are so sure, in both directions, actually.
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:39.080]   It's kind of hilarious.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:43.380]   Either they're sure that the conspiracy theory,
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:45.900]   in particular, whatever the conspiracy theory is, is false.
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:47.800]   Like they almost dismiss it like,
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:50.940]   like they don't even wanna talk about it.
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:53.080]   It's like the people, like the way they dismiss
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.140]   that the earth is flat.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:54.980]   - Yes.
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.660]   - Most scientists are like, they don't even want to like
[00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:02.380]   hear what the flat earthers are saying.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:05.180]   They don't have like zero patience for it.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:09.420]   Which is like, maybe in that case, is deserved.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:14.060]   But everything else, you really, like have empathy.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.300]   Consider the, you have, okay.
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:20.060]   This is weird to say, but I feel like
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:23.700]   you have to consider that the earth might be flat
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.220]   for like one minute.
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:27.780]   Like you have to be empathetic.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.460]   You have to be open-minded.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.900]   - I don't see a lot of that through our cultural
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.300]   tastemakers and more.
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:35.620]   And that really is what concerns me the most.
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.620]   'Cause it's just another manifestation of all of our
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:40.300]   problems, is that we have this completely
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:43.580]   bifurcating economy, bifurcating culture,
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.900]   literally, in terms of, we have the middle of the country,
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.020]   and then we have the coast.
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.260]   And in terms of the population, it's almost 50/50.
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:55.260]   And with increasing mega cities and urban culture,
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:58.900]   like urban monoculture of LA, New York, and Chicago,
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:01.420]   and DC, and Boston, and Austin,
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.700]   relative to how an entire other group of Americans
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.440]   live their lives, or even the people within them
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.220]   who aren't rich and upwardly mobile,
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.220]   how they live their lives, is just completely separating.
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:14.860]   And all of our language and communication
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.980]   in mass media and more is to the top,
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:18.700]   and then everybody else is forgotten.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:21.500]   - Do you think when you dig to the core,
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:25.540]   there is a big gap between left and right?
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:30.060]   Is that division that's perceived currently real?
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.460]   Or are most people center left and center right?
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.740]   - It's so interesting, because that's such a loaded term,
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.980]   center left.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:38.980]   What does that mean?
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:42.940]   To you, I think the way you're thinking of it is,
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.420]   I'm not like a, well, even this,
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:49.260]   I'm not a radical socialist,
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:54.260]   but I'm marginally left on cultural issues
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.540]   and economic issues.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:59.140]   This is how we've traditionally understood things.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:02.060]   And then when in popular discourse, like center right,
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.320]   like what does it mean to be center right?
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:08.320]   Like I am marginally right on social issues
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.780]   and marginally right on economic issues.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.500]   But that's just not politics.
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.180]   Like if you look at survey data, for example,
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.180]   like stimulus checks,
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.700]   people who are against stimulus checks are conservative.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.680]   Well, 80% of the population is for a stimulus check.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.180]   So that means a sizable number of Republicans
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:27.540]   are for stimulus checks.
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.900]   Same thing happens on like a wealth tax.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.100]   The same thing happens on, okay,
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.720]   Florida voted for Trump 3.1%,
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.500]   more than Barack Obama 2008.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:44.060]   On the same day, passes a $15 minimum wage at 67%.
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.260]   So what's going on?
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:46.100]   So that's why-
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.820]   - What is going on?
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.700]   - Oh, that's my entire career.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:53.660]   - But it seems like, so that's fascinating.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:57.740]   Conversation is different than the policies.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.180]   - Well, it's different than reality.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.020]   That's what I would say,
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.300]   which is that the way we have to understand
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.860]   American politics today,
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:06.580]   it didn't always used to be this way,
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:09.580]   is it's almost entirely along.
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:12.780]   Basic, I would say the main divider is,
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:14.180]   'cause even when you talk about class,
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.540]   this misses it in terms of socioeconomics,
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.740]   it's around culture,
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:21.040]   which is that it's basically,
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.240]   if you went to a four-year degree-granting institution,
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.940]   you are part of one culture.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:27.940]   If you didn't, you're part of another.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:30.900]   I don't wanna erase the 20% or whatever
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.420]   of people who did go to a college degree
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:35.380]   who were Republicans or vice versa, et cetera.
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.060]   But I'm saying on average,
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:39.880]   in terms of the median way that you feel,
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.040]   we're basically bifurcating along those lines.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.560]   And 'cause people get upset, be like,
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.280]   "Oh, well, there are rich people who voted for Trump."
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.480]   And I'm like, "Yeah, but you know who they are?
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.240]   "They're like plumbers or something.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.040]   "Like they're people who make $100,000 a year,
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.080]   "but they didn't go to a four-year college degree,
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.300]   "and they might live in a place
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.520]   "which is not an urban metro area."
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.440]   And then at the same time,
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.040]   you have like a Vox writer who makes like 30 grand,
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:11.720]   but they have a lot more cultural power than like the plumber.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.120]   So you have to think about where exactly that line is.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.480]   And I think in general, that's the way that we're trending.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.520]   So that's why when I say like,
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.360]   "What's going on?
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.180]   "Are we divided?"
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.560]   Yeah, but it's not left and right.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.760]   I mean, and that's why I hate these labels.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.360]   - So it's more just red and blue, like teams.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.880]   They're arbitrary teams.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.720]   - Yeah.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.000]   - So how arbitrary are these teams, I guess,
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.760]   is another- - Completely arbitrary.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.840]   - So, well, you kind of imply that there's,
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.880]   I don't know if you're sort of in post analyzing
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:45.240]   the patterns, 'cause it seems like there's a network effects
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.600]   of like, you just picked the team red or blue.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.240]   And it might have to do with college.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.640]   You might have to do all of those things,
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.800]   but like, it seems like it's more about
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.160]   just the people around you.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.000]   - Correct.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.920]   - So less than whether you went to college or not.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.080]   I mean, it's almost like, seems like,
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.000]   it's almost like a weird- - Yeah, right.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.400]   - Like network effects that are hard.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.600]   There's certain strong patterns that you're identifying.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.200]   But I don't know, it's sad to think
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:17.000]   that it might be just teams that have nothing to do
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.800]   with what you actually believe.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.120]   - Well, it is, Lex.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.800]   Look, I mean, I don't wanna believe that,
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.880]   but the data points me to this, which especially 2020.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.120]   I'm one of the people, chief among them,
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.400]   I will own up to it here.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:33.160]   I was totally wrong about why Trump was elected in 2016.
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.400]   I believed, and I based a lot of my public commentary
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.800]   belief on this, Trump was elected
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.600]   because of a rejection of Hillary Clinton neoliberalism
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.060]   on the back of a pro-worker message,
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:49.760]   which was anti-immigration, it was its pillar,
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:54.120]   but alongside of it was a rejection of free trade with China
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:58.880]   and generally of the political correctness and globalism,
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:02.320]   which has been coming through the Uniparty
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.440]   and same thing here with the military industrial complex
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:08.640]   and endless war, he rejected all of that.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.480]   - Wait, what's wrong with that prediction?
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.360]   - I was wrong, man.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:12.560]   And the reason I know this is that-
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.520]   - Sounds right.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:16.760]   - It sounds right, I honestly wish it was true.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.800]   But here's the truth.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.520]   Trump actually governed largely as a neoliberal Republican
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:26.600]   who was meaner online and who departed from orthodoxy
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.600]   in some very important ways, don't get me wrong.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.400]   I will always support the trade war with China.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.920]   I will always support not expanding the wars
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.600]   in Afghanistan and in Iraq.
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:38.320]   I will support him moving the Overton window
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.080]   on a million different things and revealing once and for all
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.800]   that GOP voters don't care
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.660]   about economic orthodoxy necessarily,
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.480]   but here's what they do care about.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.980]   Trump got more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016,
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:54.080]   despite not delivering largely, largely,
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.760]   for all the Trump people out there, on that agenda.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.800]   He wasn't more pro-union, but he won more union votes.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.600]   He wasn't necessarily more pro-worker,
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:07.080]   but he actually won more votes in Ohio than he did in 2016.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.880]   And he won more Hispanic votes than despite being,
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.880]   all the immigration agenda, rhetoric, et cetera.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.240]   Here's why, it's about the culture,
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.500]   which is that the culture war is so hot
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.980]   that negative partisanship is at such high levels.
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:25.300]   All of the vote is geared upon
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.000]   what the other guy might do in office.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.480]   And there's a poll actually just came out
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.800]   by Echelon Insights, Crystal and I were talking about it
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.440]   on Rising, that number one concern
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.480]   amongst Democratic voters is Trump voters,
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:41.400]   number one concern, not issues like Trump voters.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.400]   And number two is white supremacy.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:47.080]   And so like, which is basically code for Trump voters.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.960]   - And is the same true for the other side?
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.960]   - Well, so on the right,
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.400]   the number one concern is illegal immigration.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:56.800]   And number, I think three or four or whatever is Antifa,
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.680]   which is code for Democrats.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.880]   - At least on the right, it's a policy kind of thing.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.000]   - Well, yeah, it's funny,
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.800]   I saw Ben Shapiro was talking about this,
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.720]   but the reason why I would functionally say it's the same
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.260]   is because, I mean, you can believe whether it's true or not
[01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.400]   I think it actually largely is true,
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.700]   but like a lot of GOP voters feel like a lot of,
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.800]   illegal immigration is code for like people
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.520]   who are coming in, who are gonna be legalized
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:19.840]   and are gonna go vote Democrat.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.760]   Like I can just explain it from their point of view.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:26.100]   So like, what does that actually mean, each other?
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.340]   Like each other, which is that the number one concern
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:30.840]   is the other person.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.560]   So negative partisanship has never been higher.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.240]   And I think people who had my thesis
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.880]   in terms of why Trump was elected in 2016,
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.800]   you have to grapple with this.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.080]   Like, how did he win 10 million more votes?
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.640]   He came 44,000 votes away from winning the presidency
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:46.840]   across three states.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.400]   Like, I don't, none of our popular discourse
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.840]   reflects that very stark reality.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.840]   And I think so much of it is people really hate liberals.
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.760]   Like they just really hate them.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.060]   And I was driving through rural Nevada before the election.
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:06.380]   And I was like, literally in the middle of nowhere.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:09.780]   And there was this massive sign this guy had out
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:10.660]   in front of his house.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:14.380]   And it just said, Trump colon, fuck your feelings.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.240]   And I was like, that's it.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.460]   That is why people voted for Trump.
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:21.500]   And I don't wanna denigrate it because they truly feel
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.500]   they have no cultural power in America,
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:28.440]   except to raise the middle finger to the elite class
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.540]   by pressing the button for Trump.
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:31.380]   I get that.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:35.020]   That's actually a totally rational way to vote.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:37.060]   It's not the way I wish we did vote,
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:40.140]   but like, you know, that's not my place to say.
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.500]   - So this is interesting.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.260]   If you could just psychoanalyze,
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:46.660]   I'm again, probably naive about this,
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:51.660]   but I'm really bothered by the hatred of liberals.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:57.580]   It's this amorphous monster that's mocked.
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:00.980]   It's like the Shapiro liberal tears.
[01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:05.980]   And I'm also really bothered by probably more
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:09.400]   of my colleagues and friends, the hatred of Trump.
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:15.260]   The Trump and white supremacist.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:19.540]   So apparently there's 70 million white supremacists,
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.300]   75 million, sorry.
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:25.220]   There's millions of white supremacists.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:27.580]   And apparently whatever liberal is,
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:32.500]   I mean, literally liberal has become equivalent
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:36.560]   to white supremacist in the power of negativity it arouses.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.180]   I don't even know what those, I mean, honestly,
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:41.040]   they've become swears essentially.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.220]   Is that, I mean, how do we get,
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.180]   out of this?
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:49.860]   Because that's why I just don't even say anything
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:50.980]   about politics online.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:53.260]   'Cause it's like, really?
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:57.860]   Like you can't, here's what happens.
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:01.100]   Anything you say that's like thoughtful,
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:05.260]   like, hmm, I wonder, immigration, something.
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:10.260]   I wonder like why, you know, we have these many,
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:13.220]   we allow these many immigrants in,
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:16.140]   or some version of the, like, thinking through
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:18.460]   these difficult policies and so on.
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:22.020]   They immediately try to find like a single word
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:24.820]   in something you say that can put you in a bin
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:28.060]   of liberal or white supremacist,
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:30.820]   and then hammer you to death by saying
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.240]   you're one of the two, and then everybody
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.700]   just piles on happily that we finally nailed
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:39.260]   this white supremacist or liberal.
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:43.340]   And that, is this some kind of weird like feature
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:45.940]   of online communication that we've just stumbled upon?
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.700]   Is there a way, or is it possible to argue
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:51.020]   that this is like a feature, not a bug?
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:53.340]   Like this is a good thing?
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:55.340]   - Yeah, well, look, I just think it's a reflection
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:56.180]   of who we are.
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:57.500]   People like to blame social media.
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.220]   I think we're just incredibly divided right now.
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:02.140]   I think we've been divided like this for the last 20 years.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:06.140]   And I think that, the reason I focus almost 99%
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.300]   of my public commentary on economics
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.900]   is because you asked an important question at the top.
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.820]   How do we fix this?
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:14.860]   What did I say about the stimulus checks?
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:17.020]   Stimulus checks have 80% approval rating.
[01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:19.220]   So that's the type of thing, if I was Joe Biden
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.100]   and I wanted to actually heal this country,
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:22.540]   that's the very first thing I would have done
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:23.900]   when I came into office.
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:26.840]   Same thing on when you look at anything
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.980]   that's gonna increase wages.
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:30.980]   I said on the show, I was like, look,
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:33.020]   I think Joe Biden will have an 80% approval rating
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.220]   if he does two things.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.660]   If he gives every American a $2,000 stimulus check
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:40.120]   and gives everybody who wants a vaccine, a vaccine.
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:40.960]   That's it.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.780]   It's pretty simple.
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.660]   'Cause here's the thing.
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.140]   I don't really like Greg Abbott that much.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.460]   We have like very different politics.
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.300]   I'm from Texas,
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:50.300]   but my parents got vaccinated really quickly.
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:51.660]   That means something to me.
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.180]   I'm like, listen, I don't really care
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.820]   about a lot of the other stuff.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:58.240]   He got my family vaccinated.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.420]   Like that, well, I will forever remember that.
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.980]   And that's how we will remember the checks.
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.020]   This is a part of the reason
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:07.940]   why Trump almost won the election
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:10.420]   and why if the Republicans had been smart enough
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:14.780]   to give him another round of checks, 100% would have won,
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:17.140]   which is that people were like, look,
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:18.340]   I don't really like Trump,
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:20.820]   but I got a check with his name on it.
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.300]   And that meant something to me and my family.
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.940]   I'm not saying for all the libertarians out there
[01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:29.820]   that you should go and like endlessly spend money
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.060]   and buy votes.
[01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:33.940]   What I am saying is lean into
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:36.540]   the majoritarian positions
[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:40.080]   without adding your culture war bullshit on top of it.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.700]   So for example, what's the number one concern
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:45.380]   that AOC says after the first round of checks got out?
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:47.500]   Oh, the checks didn't go to illegal immigrants.
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.680]   I'm like, are you out of your fucking mind?
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.460]   Like this is the most popular policy
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:55.260]   America has probably done in 50 years,
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:58.420]   since like Medicare and you're inserting,
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.260]   you're ruining it.
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:02.040]   And then on the right is the same thing,
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.580]   which is that there'll be like,
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:08.020]   these checks are going to like, low level, blah, blah.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:10.040]   People who are lazy and don't work.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:10.880]   I'm like, oh, there you go.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:14.340]   You're just playing a caricature of what you are.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:16.380]   Like if you lean into those issues
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:17.340]   and you gotta do it clean,
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.640]   this is what everybody hates about DC,
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:23.280]   which is that Biden right now is doing the $1,400 checks,
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.160]   but he's looping it in with his COVID relief bill
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.000]   and all that.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:27.820]   That's his prerogative.
[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:28.760]   That's the Democrats prerogative.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:30.500]   They won the election, that's fine.
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.240]   But I'll tell you what I would have done if I was him.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.940]   I would have come in and I would have said,
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:36.360]   there's five United States senators
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.900]   who are on the record, Republicans,
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:39.900]   who say they'll vote for a $2,000 check.
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:42.840]   And I would put that on the floor of the United States Senate
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.240]   on my first or so, the first day possible.
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.420]   And I would have passed it.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:49.660]   And I would have forced those Republican senators
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:52.280]   to live up to that, vote for this bill,
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.760]   come to the Oval Office for a signing.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:58.840]   So that the very first thing of my presidency was to say,
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.720]   I'm giving you all this relief check.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.060]   This long national nightmare is over.
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.360]   Take this money, do with it what you need.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.480]   We've all suffered together.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.640]   The thing about Biden is he has a portrait of FDR
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.120]   in the Oval, which kind of bothers me
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.060]   because he thinks of himself as an FDR-like figure.
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:20.080]   But this is, you have to understand the majesty of FDR.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.320]   We're talking about a person
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.200]   who passed a piece of legislation
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:25.360]   five days after he became president.
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:29.240]   And he passed 15 transformative pieces of legislation
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.880]   in the first hundred days.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:35.480]   We're on day like 34, 35, and nothing has passed.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.680]   The reconciliation bill will eventually become law,
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.120]   but it will become law with no Republican votes.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.440]   And again, that's fine.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:44.920]   But it's not fulfilling that legacy
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.240]   and the urgency of the action.
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:50.360]   And the mandate, which I believe that history has handed,
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.000]   it handed it to Trump and he fucked it up, right?
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.040]   He totally screwed it up.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.400]   He could have remade America
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.440]   and made us into the greatest country ever
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.960]   coming out on the other side of this.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.040]   He decided not to do that.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.140]   I think Biden was again handed that like a scepter almost.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.040]   It's like, all you have to do,
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.800]   all America wants is for you to raise it up high,
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.560]   but he's keeping it within the realm of traditional politics.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.640]   I think it's a huge mistake.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.560]   - Why, so this is, everything you're saying
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.960]   is perfect sense.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.320]   Like take, okay.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:19.480]   It's like, again, if the aliens showed up,
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.520]   it's like the obvious thing to do is like,
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.120]   what's the popular thing?
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.160]   Like 80% of Americans support this.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.500]   Like do that clean.
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:36.400]   Also do it like with like grace
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.640]   where you're able to bring people together,
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.760]   not like in a political way,
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:44.600]   but like obvious common sense way.
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:48.600]   Like just people, the Republicans and Democrats
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.160]   is bringing them together on a policy
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.080]   and like bold, just hammer it
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.640]   without the dirt, without the mess, whatever,
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:57.800]   try to compromise just the yellow
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.000]   with have a good Twitter account,
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.280]   like loud, very clear.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.720]   We're gonna give a $2,000 stimulus check.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:11.040]   Anyone who wants a vaccine gets a vaccine at scale.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.960]   What make America, let's make America great again
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.600]   by manufacturing.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.320]   Like we are manufacturing most of the world's vaccine
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.200]   because we're bad motherfuckers.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.040]   - Yeah.
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.120]   - And without maybe with more eloquence than that
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.800]   and just do that.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.040]   Why haven't we seen that for many,
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.800]   for several presidencies?
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.600]   - 'Cause of coalitional politics
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.720]   and they owe something to somebody else.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:40.120]   For example, Biden has got a lot
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.920]   of the democratic constituency has to satisfy
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.560]   within this bill.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.080]   So there's gonna be a lot of shit that goes in there.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.240]   State and local aid, all this stuff.
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.560]   Again, I'm not even saying this is bad,
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:53.960]   but he's like, his theory is, and this isn't wrong,
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.600]   is like, we're gonna take the really popular stuff
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:00.440]   and use it as cover for the more downwardly less popular.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.640]   And so the Dems could face the accusation,
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.360]   the people who are on this side,
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.280]   this is their pushback to me.
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.080]   They're like, why would we give away
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.720]   the most popular thing in the bill?
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:13.240]   And then we would never be able to pass state and local aid.
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.440]   Why would we do that?
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.480]   And then the Republicans do the same thing.
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.720]   Mitch McConnell, because he's a fucking idiot,
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.320]   decided to say, we're gonna pair
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:24.040]   these $2,000 stimulus checks with like section 230 repeal.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.080]   And it was like, oh, it's obviously dead, right?
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.240]   Like it's not gonna happen together.
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:31.080]   That's largely why I believe Trump lost the election
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.240]   and why those races down in Georgia
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.200]   went the way that they did.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.880]   Obviously Trump had something to do with it.
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:40.000]   But the reason why is they have longstanding things
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.200]   that they've wanted to get done.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.680]   And in the words of Rahm Emanuel,
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.760]   "Never let a good crisis go to waste
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.480]   and try and get as much as you possibly can done
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.960]   within a single bill."
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.720]   My counter would be this.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.680]   Things have worked this way for too long,
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.840]   which is that the reconciliation bill
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:59.240]   is almost certainly going to be the only large
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:02.280]   signature legislative accomplishment
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.720]   of the Biden presidency.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.400]   That's just how American politics works.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.800]   Maybe he gets one more, maybe one.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.020]   He gets a second reconciliation bill,
[01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:12.900]   then you're running for midterms, it's over.
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:16.200]   I believe that by trying to change the paradigm
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.880]   of our politics, leaning into exactly what I'm talking here,
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.400]   you could possibly transcend that to a new one.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.720]   And I'm not naive.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:27.240]   I think people respond to political pressures.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:30.960]   And the way that we found this out was David Perdue,
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.880]   who is just a total corporate,
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.640]   dollar general CEO guy.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.300]   He was against the original $1,200 stimulus checks.
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.520]   But then Trump came out,
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.760]   who's the single most popular figure
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:43.760]   in the Republican party.
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.400]   He's like, "I want $2,000 stimulus checks."
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:49.260]   And all of a sudden, Perdue running in Georgia is like,
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:51.040]   "Yeah, I'm with president Trump.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.540]   "I want a $2,000 stimulus check."
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:57.000]   That was, if you're an astute observer of politics to say,
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.280]   you can see there that you can force people
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.320]   to do the right thing because it's the popular thing.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.280]   And that if it's clean,
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.200]   if you don't give them any other excuse,
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.760]   they have to do it.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.320]   So this is what we've been gaslit
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:13.240]   into our culture war framework of politics.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:17.360]   And the reason it feels so broken and awful
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.600]   is because it is, but there is a way out.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.520]   It's just that nobody wants to be,
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:23.760]   it's a game of chicken, right?
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:24.820]   Because maybe it is true.
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.540]   Maybe we would never be able to get
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:29.360]   your other Democratic priorities or Republican priorities.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.480]   But I think that the country understands
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.520]   that this is fucking terrible
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.860]   and would be willing to support somebody
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:37.120]   who does it differently.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:40.880]   There's just a lot of disincentives to not stay without,
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:43.680]   there's a lot of incentives to not stray
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.880]   from the traditional path.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:49.560]   - Yeah, is it also possible that the A students
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.360]   are not participating?
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.280]   Like we drove all of the superstars away from politics.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.120]   So like you just had-
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.680]   - I've heard this argument before.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:03.680]   - I mean, everything you're saying sort of rings true.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:08.400]   Like this is the obvious thing to do.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.840]   As a student of history, you can almost like tell,
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:14.360]   like if you look at great people in history,
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:17.160]   this is what great leaders in history, this is what they did.
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:22.000]   It's like clean, bold action.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.920]   Sometimes facing crisis, but we're facing a crisis right now.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:25.760]   - No, we're in a crisis.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.460]   - We've been, exactly.
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:32.460]   So why don't we see those leaders step up?
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:36.660]   I mean, you say that it's kind of like, it makes sense.
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:39.240]   There's a lot of different interests at play.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.840]   You don't wanna risk too many things, so on and so forth.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:46.000]   But that's what like, that sounds like the C students.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.440]   - I don't think it's that.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.220]   I think it's that the pipeline of politician creation
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:54.280]   is just totally broken from beginning to end.
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:59.280]   So it's not that A students don't wanna be politicians.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.660]   It's basically the way that our current primary system
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:05.320]   is constructed is what is the greatest threat
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.140]   to you as a member of Congress.
[01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:10.420]   It's not losing your reelection.
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:13.360]   It's losing your primary, right?
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.200]   So that means, especially in a safe district,
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.240]   you're most concerned about being hit
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.800]   if you're a Republican from the right,
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.400]   and if you're a Democrat from the left
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.880]   for not being a good enough one.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:25.600]   That's actually what stops people,
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.620]   heterodox people in particular, from winning primaries
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:30.800]   because the people who vote in our primaries
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.280]   are the party faithful.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.560]   That's how you get the production.
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.040]   The production, it's important to understand
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.680]   the production pipeline, which is that,
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:40.720]   all right, I'm from Texas, so that's what I know best.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.040]   So it's like, if you think in Texas,
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:46.120]   if you're a more heterodox like state legislature
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.640]   or something who's real works with the left on this
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.240]   and does that, you're gonna get your ass beat
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.400]   in a Republican primary because they're gonna be like,
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.800]   he worked with the left to do this, blah, blah, blah,
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.880]   take it out of context and you're screwed.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.720]   And then that means you never ascend up
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.320]   the next level of the ladder.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.640]   And then so on and so forth all the way.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.280]   But I do think Trump changed everything.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.900]   This is why I have some hope,
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:14.900]   which is that he showed me that all the people I listened to
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:16.840]   were totally wrong about politics.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.960]   And that's the most valuable lesson you could ever teach me,
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.800]   which was, I was like, wait,
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.560]   I don't have to listen to these people.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.560]   I'm like, they don't know anything, actually.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.080]   - Yeah, that's- - That's powerful, man.
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.040]   I'm like, he did it.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.080]   - That's exceptionally powerful.
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:28.920]   - This guy.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:32.480]   - Even if he didn't do anything with it.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.560]   - It doesn't matter, right.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.200]   - He showed that it's possible.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.040]   - Exactly.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.640]   - And that means a lot.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   You're absolutely right.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.120]   There's young people right now
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.880]   that kind of look, turn around and like, huh.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.840]   - You're like, wait, I don't have to comb my hair
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.560]   a certain way and go to law school and be an asshole,
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.440]   who everybody knows is an asshole,
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:55.120]   and then get elected to state legislature.
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.800]   I mean, look, who's the number one person
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:01.160]   in the New York City primary right now?
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:03.600]   Andrew Yang, he's polling higher
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.680]   than everybody else in the race.
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.360]   Look, maybe the polls are totally fucked
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.480]   and maybe he'll lose because of ranked choice voting
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.400]   and all of that, but I consider Andrew,
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.440]   I mean, I know him a little bit
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:15.160]   and I've followed his candidacy from the very beginning.
[01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.720]   I consider him an inspiration.
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:19.720]   He's the new generation of politics.
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.960]   Like if I see who's gonna be president 20 years from now,
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.040]   it's gonna be, I'm not saying it's gonna be Andrew Yang.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:27.280]   I think it's gonna be somebody like Andrew Yang,
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.800]   outside the political system,
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.760]   who talks in a totally different way, right?
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:34.320]   Just a completely, one of my favorite things
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.760]   that he said on the debate stage, he's like,
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.960]   "Look at us, we're all wearing makeup."
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:38.800]   It's crazy, you know what I'm saying?
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:42.200]   - And he like brought that, that he brought that,
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.760]   and he's right, like, "Yeah, why are,
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:44.600]   "they're all wearing makeup."
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:47.400]   - He probably, arguably hasn't gone far enough almost,
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.080]   because, but he showed that it's possible.
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.320]   And then you see other, like AOC's a good example
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.460]   of somebody, at least in my opinion,
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:56.480]   is doing the same kind of thing,
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:00.440]   but going too far in like, well, I don't know,
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.280]   she's doing the Trump thing, but on the other side.
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.320]   So I don't know, what's too far, who knows?
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.040]   - Don't take a normative judgment of it.
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.520]   I will tell you the future of politics looks like this.
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:08.680]   - Appreciate the art of it.
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:09.520]   - Right, no, I do.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:12.080]   Look, I don't, I'm not a big AOC fan,
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:14.200]   but she's a genius, media genius,
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.040]   once in a generation talent.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:19.680]   The way that she uses social media, Instagram,
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.680]   and everybody on the right is like trying to copy her.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:24.320]   Like Matt Gaetz is like, "I wanna be the conservative AOC."
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.640]   I'm like, "It's just not gonna happen, dude."
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.200]   Like, you just don't have it.
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.920]   Like what she has, it's like, it's electric.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.960]   And Trump had that.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.640]   Like I've been to a Trump rally,
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.780]   like to cover as a journalist, it's nothing like it.
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:39.080]   And Yang is similar.
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.400]   It's the same way where you're like,
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.080]   "There is something going on here,"
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.760]   which is just, like I've been to an Obama rally,
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.400]   I've been to a Clinton rally,
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.560]   I've been to several normal politics.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.340]   Yeah, it's fine, you know?
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:55.960]   With Trump and with Yang, it's another world.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.000]   - Yeah. - It's another world.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.360]   - Yang gang. - Yes.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.240]   - There's probably thousands of people listening right now
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:03.080]   who are just like doing a slow clap.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.120]   Yes. - I know, I know.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.880]   - Yang gang forever.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.400]   Okay, but yeah, I mean, my worst fear,
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:15.400]   I prefer Andrew Yang kind of free improvisational idea,
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:21.640]   exchange, all that versus AOC,
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:25.440]   who I think no matter what she stands for
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:29.420]   is a drama machine, creates dramas just like Trump does.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:33.240]   I would say my worst fear would be in 2024,
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:34.520]   is AOC old enough?
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.320]   It'd be AOC versus Trump.
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.420]   - I don't think she's old enough.
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:39.640]   I think you'd have to be, I think she's 30.
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:41.880]   So she needs five more years, so probably not.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:42.720]   Yeah. - Okay.
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:45.440]   But that kind of, that's, or Trump Jr.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.620]   - Well, AOC probably wouldn't win a Democratic primary.
[01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:49.700]   So I mean, look, Joe Biden has, you know,
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.000]   they pretty much showed that.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.320]   - That's exactly what you're saying.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:55.800]   This process grooms you over time.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.880]   You see the same thing in academia, actually,
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:02.520]   which is very interesting, is the process of getting tenure.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:06.080]   There's this, it's like you're being taught
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:11.760]   without explicitly being taught to behave
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.480]   in the way that everybody's behaved before.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.640]   I've heard this, it was funny,
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.800]   I've had a few conversations
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.680]   that were deeply disappointing,
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:25.000]   which involved statements like,
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.400]   "This is what's good for your career."
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.240]   - Yes.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:33.240]   - This kind of, almost like mentor to mentee conversation,
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.240]   where it's, you know, it's like,
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.720]   there's a grooming process in the same way,
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:39.080]   I guess you're saying the primary process
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.080]   does the same kind of thing.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:42.360]   So, I mean, that's what people have talked about
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:45.580]   with Andrew Yang, it was, he was being suppressed
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:47.820]   by a bunch of different forces, the mainstream media,
[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:49.900]   and all, just the democratic,
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:54.360]   just that whole process didn't like the honesty
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.200]   that he was showing, right?
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.380]   - For now, but here's my question to you.
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:59.700]   People gotta see, look, Jordan Peterson
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.700]   is one of the most famous people in America, right?
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.700]   Like, you have a massive podcast,
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:07.220]   you're more famous than half the, 99% of the people at MIT.
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:10.700]   So, like, from that perspective, everything has changed.
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:12.380]   And somewhere out there,
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:14.340]   there's a student who's taking notice.
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:16.100]   And I've noticed that with my own career,
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:17.300]   everybody thought I was crazy
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:19.060]   for doing this show with Crystal, "The Hill."
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:19.900]   They thought I was nuts.
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:21.100]   They're like, "What are you doing?
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:22.540]   You're a White House correspondent.
[01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:24.480]   You've got a job forever."
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:25.660]   The other job offer I had
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:27.320]   was being a White House correspondent.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:30.960]   And people thought I was nuts for not just sticking there
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.140]   and, you know, aging out within Washington,
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:39.140]   pining for appearances on Fox News and CNN and MSNBC,
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:40.260]   but I hated it.
[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:41.380]   I just hated doing it.
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:43.300]   And I did not wanna be a company man,
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:45.500]   like a Washington man, who's one of those guys
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.100]   who, like, brags to his friends
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.460]   about how many times he's been on Fox or whatever,
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:51.820]   mostly because I just have a rebellious streak
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:55.300]   and I hate being at the subject of other people.
[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:56.340]   I created something new,
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:58.420]   which a lot of people watch to get their news.
[01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:00.900]   And I noticed that younger people
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.820]   who are almost all my audience,
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:05.060]   they don't really look up to any of the people
[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:06.140]   in traditional, right?
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:08.960]   They don't go, they're not coming up and being like,
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.860]   "How do I be like Jim Acosta?"
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:12.220]   You know, they're like,
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:13.780]   "Hey, how did you do what you do?
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:16.460]   And the way you did it is by bucking the system."
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:20.300]   So I think that we are at a total split point.
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:23.620]   And look, there will always be a path for people,
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:26.180]   'cause I don't want people to over-learn this lesson.
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:27.780]   I have people who are like, "I'm not gonna go to college."
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:29.340]   And I'm like, "Well, just wait."
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:30.620]   - Yeah, like, I'm like, just--
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:31.460]   - I was starting to apologize.
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:32.340]   - Yeah, like, stop.
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:34.820]   Just like, just hold on a second.
[01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:37.620]   - But there will always be a path for the institutional
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:39.220]   that will always be there for you.
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:40.900]   But now there's something else.
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:42.340]   Now there's another game in town.
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:45.060]   And that's more appealing to millions and millions
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.920]   and millions and millions of people
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:50.020]   who feel unserved by the corporate media,
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:54.580]   CNN, and these people, possibly who feel unserved
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:55.960]   in the, you know, the faculty.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:58.980]   Like, if you are an up-and-comer
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:02.620]   who wants to teach as many young people as possible,
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:04.540]   I think you should be on YouTube, right?
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:05.900]   Like, look at the Khan Academy guy.
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.900]   That guy created a huge business.
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:10.460]   So I just think we can be cynical
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:12.600]   and like upset about what that system is,
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.960]   but we should also have hope.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:16.940]   Like, I have a lot of hope for what can be in the future.
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:18.860]   - Yeah, there's a guy people should check out.
[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:20.540]   So my story is a little bit different
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:24.060]   because I basically stepped aside
[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:28.340]   with the dream of being an entrepreneur
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.300]   earlier in the pipeline
[01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:34.340]   than like a legitimate, like, senior faculty would.
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:35.620]   There's an example of somebody
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:37.760]   that people should check out, Andrew Huberman,
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:40.180]   from Stanford, who's a neuroscientist,
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:42.500]   who is as world-class as it gets
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:45.340]   in terms of like 10-year faculty,
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:48.320]   just a really world-class researcher.
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.140]   And now he's doing YouTube.
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:52.300]   - Yeah, I see him on Instagram, yeah.
[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:54.700]   - So he switched, so he not just does Instagram,
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:56.660]   he now has a podcast,
[01:30:56.660 --> 01:31:00.440]   and he's doing, he's changing the nature of like,
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:04.760]   I believe that Andrew might be the future of Stanford.
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:07.300]   And for a lot, it's funny,
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:10.520]   like he's basically Joe Rogan is an inspiration to Andrew,
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:13.060]   and to me as well.
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:14.480]   And those ripple effects,
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:16.300]   and Andrew is an inspiration probably,
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:17.140]   just like you're saying,
[01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:20.460]   to these young, like 25-year-olds
[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:22.020]   who are soon to become faculty,
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:23.800]   if we're just talking about academia.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:26.700]   And the same is probably happening with government.
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:31.540]   Is, funny enough, Trump probably is inspiring
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:33.620]   a huge number of people who are saying,
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.620]   "Wait a minute, I don't have to play by the rules."
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:36.460]   - Exactly.
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:39.580]   - "I can think outside the box here."
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:42.460]   And you're right, and the institutions we're seeing
[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:44.580]   are just probably lagging behind.
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:48.100]   So the optimistic view is the future
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:50.220]   is going to be full of exciting new ideas.
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:52.140]   So Andrew Yang is just kind of the beginning
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:54.540]   of this whole thing. - He's tip of the iceberg.
[01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:56.420]   - And I hope that iceberg doesn't,
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:57.740]   it's not this influencer.
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:00.460]   One of the things that really bothers me.
[01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:01.300]   - Yeah.
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:03.580]   - I've gotten a chance, I should be careful here,
[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:05.660]   I don't wanna, I love everybody,
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:10.300]   but these people who talk about how to make
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:13.220]   your first million or how to succeed,
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:16.540]   and they're so, I mean, yeah,
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:21.100]   that makes me a little bit cynical about,
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:25.460]   I'm worried that the people that win the game of politics
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:29.820]   will be ones that want to win the game of politics.
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:31.140]   - They already are, man.
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:33.740]   - And like we mentioned, AOC,
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:38.740]   I hope they optimize for the 80% populist thing, right?
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:42.380]   Like they optimize for that bad-ass thing
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:45.140]   that history will remember you as the great man or woman
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:49.500]   that did this thing versus how do I maximize engagement
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.740]   today and keep growing those numbers?
[01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:55.640]   The influencers are so, I'm so allergic to this, man.
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:58.460]   They keep saying how many followers they have
[01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:00.900]   on the different accounts, and it's like,
[01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:05.740]   I don't think they understand, maybe I don't understand,
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:06.780]   I don't really care.
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:12.340]   I think it has destructive psychological effects,
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:15.580]   one, like thinking about the number,
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:19.820]   like getting excited your number went from 100 to 101,
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:23.420]   and being like, and today it went out to 105.
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.620]   Whoa, that's a big jump.
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:26.220]   That may be, like thinking this way,
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:28.860]   like I wonder what I did, I'll do that again.
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:31.660]   In this way, one, it creates anxiety
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.100]   and those psychological effects, whatever.
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:37.060]   The more important thing is it prevents you
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:42.060]   from truly thinking boldly in the long arc of history
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:45.980]   and creatively, thinking outside the box,
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:48.060]   doing huge actions.
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:50.580]   And I actually, my optimism is in the sense
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:54.400]   that that kind of action will beat out all the influencers.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.980]   - Well, I don't know, Lex.
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:56.820]   (Lex laughs)
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:58.180]   This is where my cynicism comes in.
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:00.540]   So there's a guy, Madison Cawthorn,
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:02.820]   the youngest member of Congress,
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:05.820]   and he, I don't wanna say got caught,
[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:08.060]   but there was like an email where he was like,
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:11.700]   "My staff is only oriented around comms."
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:14.100]   Like he was basically saying, he got basically caught saying
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:19.100]   like, "My staff is only centered on communications."
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:21.260]   And that's the right play.
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:23.860]   If you do want to get the benefits
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:26.760]   of our current electoral, political, and engagement system,
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:29.300]   which is that, what's the best way to be known
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:32.200]   within the right as a right-wing politician?
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:36.720]   It's to be a culture warrior, go on Ben Shapiro's podcast,
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:40.380]   be one of the people on Fox News, go on Sean Hannity's show,
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:42.660]   go on Tucker's show, and all of that,
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:47.020]   because you become a mini celebrity within that world.
[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:50.380]   Left unsaid is that that world is increasingly shrinking,
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:52.100]   portion of the American population,
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:56.060]   and they barely, they can't even win a popular vote election,
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:58.120]   let alone barely win, eke out
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:01.680]   an electoral college victory in 2016.
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.640]   Well, but the incentives are all aligned within that.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.880]   And it's the same thing really on the left,
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.740]   but you're right, which is that,
[01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:11.560]   and look, this is why geniuses are geniuses,
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.200]   because they buck the short-term incentives,
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.420]   they focus on the long-term, they bet big,
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:21.060]   and they usually fail, but then when they get big,
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:24.680]   they succeed spectacularly.
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:27.440]   The people I know who have done this the best
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:31.600]   are a lot of the crypto folks that I've spoken to.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:32.760]   Some of the stuff they say, I'm like,
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.240]   "I don't know if that's gonna happen,
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:35.920]   "but look, they're like billionaires."
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:36.760]   Right? - Yeah.
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.560]   - And you're like, "So they were right."
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:41.640]   So the way I've heard it expressed is,
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:44.160]   you can be wrong a lot, but when you're right,
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.680]   you get right big.
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:47.680]   And I mean, I've seen this in Elon Musk's career,
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:52.680]   I mean, he took spectacular risk, like spectacular risk,
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:55.000]   and just doubled down, doubled down, doubled down,
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.120]   doubled down, doubled down.
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:57.780]   And you can kind of tell to him,
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:35:59.060]   I mean, you know him better than I do,
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:02.520]   but from my observation, I don't think the money matters.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:03.360]   - No. - Right?
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:05.520]   I just, when I see him, I'm like,
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:08.760]   I don't, it's, nobody works as hard as you do
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.940]   and builds the way that you build
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.280]   if it's just about the money.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.080]   It just doesn't happen.
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:18.480]   Nobody wills SpaceX into existence just for the money.
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.000]   It's not worth it, frankly, right?
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.820]   He probably destroyed years of his life
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:23.440]   in mental sanity.
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.280]   - Money or attention or fame, none of that.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.680]   - Yeah. - It's not the primary
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.520]   priority. - Well, that's what's
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:30.280]   so appealing to me, to me in particular, about him,
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:32.640]   just like in how he built, like I read a biography of him
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.920]   and just the way that he constructed his life
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:37.740]   and is able to hyper-focus in meeting after meeting
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:40.500]   and drill down and also hire all the right people
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:43.340]   who execute each one of his tasks discreetly
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:45.720]   to his perfection is amazing.
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.540]   That's actually the mark of a good leader.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:50.680]   But I mean, if you think about his career,
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:53.220]   the reason he's a renegade is 'cause probably he was told
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:55.420]   to put it in an index fund or whatever,
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:57.460]   like whenever he made his 29 million,
[01:36:57.460 --> 01:36:59.540]   and from PayPal, I don't know how much he made,
[01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:01.360]   and then just go along that road, and he's like, no.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:04.020]   So he succeeds spectacularly.
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:07.260]   So you have to have somebody who's willing to come in
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:08.240]   and buck that system.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.080]   So for now, I think our politics are generally frozen.
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:16.860]   I think that that model is gonna be most generally appealing
[01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:18.820]   to the mean person.
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:20.720]   But somebody will come along and will change everything.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:22.720]   - Yeah, I'm just surprised there's not more of them.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:23.560]   - Yeah.
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:28.040]   - On that topic, it's now, what is it, 21?
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:29.300]   - Yes.
[01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:31.560]   - Let's make some predictions that you can be wrong about.
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.400]   - Good.
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.960]   (both laughing)
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:37.760]   - What major political people are you thinking
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:42.760]   will run in 2024, including Trump Jr., Sr., or Ivanka?
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.040]   I don't know.
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:46.240]   (both laughing)
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.200]   Any Trump.
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.020]   Trump.
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:50.000]   - Yeah.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.400]   And who do you think wins?
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:56.120]   - I think Joe Biden will run again in 2024,
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.720]   and I think he will run against someone
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.640]   with the last name Trump.
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:03.840]   I do not know whether that is Trump or Trump Jr.,
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.560]   but I think one of those people
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:08.280]   will probably be the GOP nominee in 2024.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.680]   - Who is it, some prominent political figure,
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.200]   was it Romney, somebody like that,
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:15.160]   said that Trump will win the primary if he runs again?
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.720]   - Of course, that's not even a question.
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.060]   Trump is the single most popular figure
[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:22.960]   in the Republican Party by orders of magnitude.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.320]   Oh, I mean, probably more, honestly.
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.740]   There was a, actually, I can tell you
[01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:30.280]   'cause I saw the data, which is that pre-January 6th,
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:33.740]   it was like 54% of Republicans wanted him to run again.
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:37.340]   Then it went down eight points after January 6th,
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:39.580]   two days later, and then after impeachment,
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:42.440]   it went right back up to 54%.
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:46.960]   So the exact same number is in February
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.020]   at post-impeachment vote as it was after November.
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:52.620]   Now, look, yeah, again, surveys, bullshit, et cetera,
[01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:54.100]   but that's all the data we have,
[01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:55.500]   that's what I can point you to.
[01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:57.900]   If Trump runs, he will be the nominee,
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:00.940]   and he will be the 2024 nominee.
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:02.820]   I just don't know if he wants to.
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:04.140]   It really depends.
[01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:05.620]   - Do you think he wins?
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:09.100]   After the Trump vaccine heals all of us,
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:10.260]   do you think Trump wins?
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:12.480]   - It depends on how popular culture functions
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:13.520]   over the next four years.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:15.240]   And I can tell you that they are,
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.080]   'cause I don't think Biden has that much to do with it
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.880]   because, again, Trump is not a manifestation
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.920]   of an affirmative policy action.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:26.600]   It is a defensive bulwark wall
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:29.760]   against cultural liberalism at its best.
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.360]   So it's like, this is why it doesn't matter what Biden does.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.160]   If there are more riots,
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:38.880]   if there is a more sense of persecution
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:43.020]   amongst people who are more lean towards conservative
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:45.800]   or like, "Hey, I don't know about that, that's crazy,"
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:48.340]   then he very well could win.
[01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:50.100]   Let's, okay, let's say Joe Biden doesn't run
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.340]   and they put up Kamala Harris,
[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:52.740]   I think he would beat her.
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:54.700]   And I don't think there's a question
[01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:56.940]   that Trump would beat Kamala Harris in 2024.
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:59.500]   - And you don't think anybody else,
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.180]   I don't know how the process works,
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:03.180]   you don't think anybody else on the Democratic side
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.740]   can take the-
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:07.740]   - Well, how could you run against the sitting vice president?
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:11.400]   It's like, if Joe Biden has a 98% approval rating
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:14.720]   in the Democratic Party, if he says, "She is my heir,"
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:16.400]   I think enough people will listen to him
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.260]   in a competitive primary or a non-competitive primary.
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:20.280]   And then there's all these things
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:23.160]   about how primary systems themselves are rigged,
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:26.580]   the DNC could make it known that they'll blacklist anybody
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:29.820]   who does try and primary Kamala Harris.
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:32.560]   And look, I mean, progressives aren't necessarily
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:35.000]   all that popular amongst actual Democrats.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.800]   Like we found that out during the election.
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:40.660]   There's an entire constituency which loves Joe Biden
[01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:42.320]   and Joe Biden level politics.
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:44.680]   And so if he tells them to vote for Kamala,
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:47.180]   I think she would probably get it.
[01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:50.000]   But again, there's a lot of game theory obviously happening.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.200]   - But see, I think you're talking about
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.080]   everything you're saying is correct
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:55.960]   about mediocre candidates.
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:59.600]   It feels like if there's somebody like a really strong,
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:02.360]   I don't wanna use this term incorrectly, but populist,
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:05.360]   somebody that speaks to the 80%
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:10.360]   that's is able to provide bold,
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:15.040]   eloquently described solutions that are popular.
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:17.160]   I think that breaks through all of this nonsense.
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.000]   - How?
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.520]   How do they break through the primary system?
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.520]   'Cause the problem is the primary system is not populism.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.020]   It's primary.
[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:24.860]   So it's like--
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:27.720]   - But you don't think they can tweet their way to--
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:30.720]   - Well, you have to be willing to win a GOP primary.
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:32.760]   You basically have to be at,
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:35.440]   whoever wins the GOP primary, in my opinion,
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:37.660]   will be the person most hated by the left.
[01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:39.800]   One of the people, things that people forget,
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:41.920]   is you know who came in second to Trump?
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:42.960]   Ted Cruz.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.960]   And the reason why is 'cause Ted Cruz
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:48.720]   was the second most hated guy by liberals in America,
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:49.900]   second to Trump.
[01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:51.560]   They have nothing in policy in common.
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:53.680]   - But don't you think this kind of
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:56.240]   brilliantly described system of hate
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:01.240]   being the main mechanism of our electoral choices,
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:05.240]   don't you think that just has to do with mediocre candidates?
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:11.240]   Basically, the field of candidates, including Trump,
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:13.680]   including everybody, was just like,
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:16.680]   didn't make anyone feel great.
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:17.680]   It's like, really?
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.680]   This is what we have to choose from?
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.120]   - Maybe a Mark Cuban.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:26.080]   Or like, Mark Cuban is a Democrat.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:29.160]   Or it would have to be somebody like that.
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.960]   Somebody who, 'cause here's the thing about Trump.
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:32.400]   It's not just that it was Trump.
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:34.480]   He was so fucking famous.
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.320]   People don't realize.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.040]   He was so famous.
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:39.900]   Even when I first met Trump,
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:41.760]   I met a couple of other presidents,
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:44.560]   but when I met Trump, even I felt kinda starstruck.
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:47.760]   'Cause I was like, yo, this is the guy from The Apprentice.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:49.480]   I'm like, this is the dude.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.320]   - From The Apprentice?
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.560]   - Yeah, 'cause I'm like, my dad and I
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.520]   used to sit and watch The Apprentice
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:55.440]   when I was in high school.
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:57.520]   And then one of the guys was from College Station
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:58.520]   where I grew up and we're like,
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:01.120]   oh my God, that guy's on The Apprentice.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.280]   It was a phenomenon.
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:03.120]   There's like that level.
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:04.280]   It's kinda like when I met Joe Rogan.
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:06.760]   I'm like, holy shit, that's Joe Rogan.
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:08.640]   I don't feel that way when I meet Mitt Romney
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:10.000]   or Tom Cotton or Josh Hall.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:10.840]   And I met all of them.
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:12.480]   - But there's a lot of celebrities, right?
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.560]   Do you think there's some celebrities
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.520]   we're not even thinking about that could step in?
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:16.360]   The Rock?
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.240]   - It'd have to be, so I was about to say,
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:19.480]   I think The Rock could do it.
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:20.880]   But does he wanna do it?
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:21.920]   I mean, it's terrible.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:23.760]   Like, it's a terrible gig.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.440]   It's very hard to do.
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:27.120]   I don't know if The Rock necessarily
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.680]   has like the formed policy agenda.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.080]   'Cause then here's the other problem.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:32.920]   What if we set ourselves up for a system
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:34.320]   where like these people keep winning,
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.160]   but like with Trump,
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:37.040]   they have no idea how to run a government.
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.600]   It's actually really hard, right?
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:41.040]   And you have to have the know-how and the trust
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.880]   to find the right people.
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:46.160]   This is where the genius element comes in
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:48.540]   is you have to understand that front
[01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:52.000]   and you have to understand how to execute discrete tasks.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.440]   Like this is the FDR.
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.720]   This is why it's so hard.
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:59.960]   Like FDR, Lincoln, TR, they were who they were
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:02.380]   and they live in history and their name rings
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:04.220]   like for a reason.
[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:07.040]   And yeah, I mean, one of the most depressing lessons
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.720]   I got from 2020 is at almost,
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:11.920]   it seems like in my opinion,
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:15.240]   that we over learn the lesson of our success
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:16.560]   and not of our failures.
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:19.560]   For example, like we have this narrative in our head
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.880]   that we always have the right person
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:23.920]   at the right time during crisis.
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:25.640]   And in some cases it was true.
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:26.960]   We didn't deserve Lincoln.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.540]   We didn't deserve FDR.
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:33.400]   We didn't deserve a lot of presidents at times of crisis.
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:36.840]   But then you're like, okay, George W. Bush, 9/11,
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:38.480]   that was terrible.
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:41.840]   Reconstruction, Andrew Johnson, awful, right?
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:44.520]   Like we had several periods in our history
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.600]   where the crisis was there,
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:50.160]   they were called and they did not show up.
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:54.080]   And I really, it hadn't happened in my lifetime
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:55.680]   except for 9/11.
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:58.800]   And even then you could kind of see that as an opportunity
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:01.360]   for somebody like Obama to come in and fix it.
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:02.760]   But then he didn't do it.
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:04.560]   And then Trump didn't do it.
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.320]   And you realize, I feel like our politics are most analogous
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:14.000]   to like the 1910s, like all in terms of the Gilded Age,
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.200]   in terms of that.
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:17.600]   Remember there's that long period of presidents
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:22.400]   between like Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt,
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.040]   we were like, wait, like who was president?
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:28.240]   Or even TR was like an exception where you'll have like
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:30.960]   Calvin Coolidge, who like, Silent Cow.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:31.800]   - So we're living through that.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:33.120]   - Grover Cleveland.
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:36.640]   That's kind of how, if I think of us within history,
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:38.860]   I feel like we're in one of those times.
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:39.700]   We're just waiting.
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:41.640]   - It feels really important to us right now.
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.640]   Like this is the most important moment in history,
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.480]   but it might be-
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:45.840]   - It could just be a blip, right?
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:46.880]   20, 30 year blip.
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.840]   Like when you think about who was president
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:52.240]   between 1890 and 19 before, I mean, yeah.
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:56.740]   Between like 1888 and 1910.
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:58.880]   Like nobody really thinks about that period of America,
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:01.600]   but like that was an entire lifetime for people, right?
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.640]   Like what did they, how did they feel
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.960]   about the country that they were in?
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:05.800]   - That's hilarious.
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:07.400]   - That's how I kind of think about where we are right now.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.440]   - It's funny to think, I mean, I don't want to minimize it,
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:12.040]   but like we haven't really gone through
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:13.960]   a World War II style crisis.
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:17.560]   So like say that there is a crisis
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:21.440]   in like several decades of that level, right?
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:25.060]   Existential risks to a large portion of the world.
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:29.920]   Then what will be remembered is World War II,
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.640]   maybe a little bit about Vietnam
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:34.120]   and then whatever that crisis is.
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:36.000]   And this whole period that we see as dramatic,
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.320]   even coronavirus.
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.160]   - Even 9/11.
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.240]   - Even 9/11.
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:42.680]   It's like, 'cause you can look at how many people died
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:43.700]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:45.880]   All the drama around the war on terror
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:47.760]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:49.640]   Maybe Obama will be remembered
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:52.400]   for being the first African-American president.
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.880]   But then like, that's, yeah,
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:56.320]   that's fascinating to think about.
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:00.640]   Oh man, even Trump will be like, oh, okay, cool.
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:01.480]   - He was that guy.
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:05.840]   - Yeah, maybe he'll be remembered as the first celebrity.
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:10.720]   I mean, Reagan was already a governor, right?
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:11.740]   - Yeah, he was.
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:14.940]   - So like the first apolitical celebrity that was able,
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:18.020]   so maybe if there's more celebrities in the future,
[01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:19.740]   they'll say that Trump was the first person
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:23.140]   to pave the way for celebrities to win.
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:24.860]   Oh man, yeah.
[01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:29.020]   And yeah, I still hold that this era
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:30.560]   will probably be remembered.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:34.500]   People say I talk about Elon way too much,
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:37.900]   but the reality is like, there's not many people
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:39.620]   that are doing the kind of things he's doing
[01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:41.240]   is why I talk about it.
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:44.780]   I think this era, it's not necessarily Elon and SpaceX,
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:48.080]   but this era will be remembered by the new,
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:51.560]   like of the space exploration,
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.280]   of the commercial, of companies getting
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:57.320]   into space exploration, of space travel,
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:01.760]   and perhaps like artificial intelligence
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:04.160]   around social media, all those kinds of things.
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.160]   This might be remembered for that.
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:08.760]   But all the political bickering, all that nonsense,
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:11.140]   that might be very well forgotten.
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:16.140]   - One way to think about it is that the internet is so young.
[01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:17.060]   I think about it.
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:17.900]   - That's right.
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:20.900]   - So Jeff Jarvis, he's a media scholar I respect.
[01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:22.160]   He's not the only person to say this,
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:23.540]   but many others have, which is that,
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:25.800]   look, this is kind of like the printing press.
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:27.680]   There was a whole 30 years war
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:29.320]   because of the printing press.
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:31.780]   It took a long time for shit to sort out.
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:33.220]   I think that's where we're at with the internet.
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:36.340]   Like at a certain level, it disrupts everything.
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:37.380]   And that's a good thing.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:38.880]   It can be very tumultuous.
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:41.880]   I never felt like I was living through history
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:43.060]   until coronavirus.
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:45.140]   Like, you know, like until we were all locked down,
[01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:46.980]   I was like, I'm living through history.
[01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:50.400]   Like this, there's this very overused cliche in DC
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.320]   where every comm staffer wants you to think
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.420]   that what their boss just did is history.
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:56.020]   And I've always been like, this isn't history.
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:58.340]   This is some like stupid fucking bill, you know, whatever.
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:00.240]   But like, that was the first time I was like,
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:03.140]   this is history, like this right here.
[01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:06.820]   - Well, I was hoping, tragedy aside,
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:10.820]   that this, I wish the primaries happened during coronavirus
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:13.980]   so that we, because like, then we can see the,
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:17.460]   so, okay, here's a bunch of people facing crisis
[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:20.120]   and it's an opportunity for a leader to step up.
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:23.220]   Like, I still believe the optimistic view is
[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:27.500]   the game theory of like influencers
[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:31.340]   will always be defeated by actual great leaders.
[01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:34.180]   So like, maybe the great leaders are rare,
[01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:36.780]   but I think they're sufficiently out there
[01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:39.860]   that they will step up, especially in moments of crisis.
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:43.140]   And coronavirus is obviously a crisis.
[01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:46.920]   We're like, you know, mass manufacture of tests,
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:50.700]   all kinds of infrastructure building
[01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:52.500]   that you could have done in 2020.
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:56.140]   There's so many possibilities for just like bold action.
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:57.140]   - It makes you sad.
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:00.700]   - None of that, even just,
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:04.820]   forget actually doing the action, advocating for it.
[01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:07.780]   Just saying like, this, we need to do this.
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:11.660]   And none of that, like the speeches that Biden made,
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:14.780]   I don't even remember a single speech that Biden made
[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:16.340]   because there's zero bold.
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:18.420]   I mean, their strategy was to be quiet
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:21.500]   and let Donald Trump-
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:23.020]   - Polarize the electorate.
[01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:25.460]   - Polarize the electorate and hope that results
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:30.460]   in them winning because of the high unemployment numbers
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:31.960]   and all those kinds of things,
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:34.620]   as opposed to like, let's go big,
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:36.220]   let's go with a big speech.
[01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:42.740]   Yeah, it's a lost opportunity in some sense.
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:44.300]   So we talked a bunch about politics,
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:45.980]   but one of the other interesting things
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:48.420]   is that you're involved with is,
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:53.200]   or involved with defining the future of is journalism.
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:54.980]   I suppose you can think of podcasts
[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:58.820]   as a kind of journalism, but also just writing in general,
[01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:01.780]   just whatever the hell the future of this thing looks like
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:05.460]   is up to be defined by people like you.
[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:09.140]   So what do you think is broken about journalism?
[01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:11.780]   And what do you think is the future of journalism?
[01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:13.980]   - I think the future of journalism looks much more
[01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:17.160]   like what we, you and I are doing here right now.
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:20.800]   And journalism is gonna be downstream from a culture
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:22.220]   that can be a good and a bad thing,
[01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:23.960]   depending on how you look at it.
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:26.140]   We are gonna look at our media.
[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:29.420]   Our media is gonna look much more like it did
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:31.260]   pre-mass media.
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:35.500]   And the way that I mean that is that back in the 18,
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:38.060]   in the 1800s in particular,
[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:40.220]   especially after the invention of the telegraph,
[01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:43.140]   when information itself was known.
[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:46.020]   So for example, like you and I don't need to,
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:47.820]   let's say you and I are competing journalists.
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:50.820]   You and I are no longer competing, quote unquote,
[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:54.140]   to tell the public X event happened.
[01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:58.860]   All journalism today is largely explaining
[01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:01.340]   why did X happen?
[01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:04.460]   And part of the problem with that is that,
[01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:08.100]   that means that it's all up for partisan interpretation.
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:09.840]   Now you can say that that's a bad thing.
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:11.100]   I think it's a great thing,
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:13.700]   because the highest level of literacy
[01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:17.060]   and news viewership in America
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:19.780]   was during the time of yellow journalism,
[01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:22.140]   was during the time of partisan journalism.
[01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:23.020]   Not a surprise.
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:25.820]   People like to read the news from people
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:26.840]   that they agree with.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:29.960]   You could say that's bad, echo chambers, et cetera.
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:31.240]   That's the downside of it.
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:33.480]   The upside is more people are more educated.
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:36.560]   More people are interested in the news.
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:40.040]   So I think the proliferation of mass media,
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:42.440]   I mean, sorry, of this format, of-
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:43.760]   - Long form. - Eshing,
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:45.960]   of not just long form.
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:48.840]   Dude, I do updates on Instagram, which are five minutes.
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:50.480]   - Oh, you consider like Instagram?
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:51.980]   - Yeah, oh yeah. - Almost even Twitter.
[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:53.120]   - Oh, of course Twitter.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:54.560]   Twitter is where I get my news from.
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:55.460]   I don't read the paper.
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:57.680]   I have literally, Twitter is my news aggregator.
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:01.200]   It's called my wire, where I find out about hard events.
[01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:03.320]   Like the president has departed the White House.
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:04.860]   - But not only that, I don't know about you,
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:06.720]   but I also looked at Twitter,
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:07.920]   to the exact thing you're saying,
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:09.640]   which is the response to the news.
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:13.000]   Like the thoughtful, sounds ridiculous,
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.080]   but you can be pretty thoughtful in a single tweet.
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:18.520]   - If you follow the right people, you can get that.
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:21.040]   And so that is the future of media,
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:22.880]   which is that the future of media
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:26.140]   is it will be much smaller amount,
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:27.500]   or it's much larger amounts of people,
[01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:29.540]   which are famous to smaller groups.
[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:32.180]   So Walter Cronkite's never gonna happen again,
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:34.300]   at least in our, and probably within our lifetimes,
[01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:37.660]   where everybody in America know who's this guy is.
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:39.180]   That age is over.
[01:53:39.180 --> 01:53:40.420]   I think that's a good thing,
[01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:42.940]   because now people are gonna get the news
[01:53:42.940 --> 01:53:44.780]   from the people that they trust.
[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:46.460]   Yes, some of it will be opinionated.
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:49.060]   I'm gonna, my program, I'm,
[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:51.220]   Crystal and I are like, we are,
[01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:53.760]   this, she's coming from this like view.
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:55.140]   I'm coming from this view.
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:57.640]   That's our bias when we talk about information,
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.180]   and we're gonna talk about the information
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:00.820]   that we think is important.
[01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:02.740]   And it has garnered a large audience.
[01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:06.200]   I think that's very much where the future is gonna be.
[01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:08.720]   And the reason why I think that's a good thing
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:13.200]   is because people will be engaged more within it,
[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:14.760]   rather than the current system,
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:17.920]   where news is highly concentrated, highly consolidated,
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:20.820]   has groupthink, has the same
[01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:23.680]   elite production pipeline problem of,
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:25.280]   everybody knows journalists all come
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:27.280]   from the same socioeconomic background,
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:29.300]   and they all party together here in DC,
[01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:31.840]   or in New York, or in LA, or wherever,
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:33.800]   and they're part of the same monoculture,
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:35.640]   and that affects what they,
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:37.120]   that affects what they report.
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:40.520]   This will cause a total dispersion of all of that.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:44.640]   The battle of our age is gonna be the guild
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.200]   versus the non-guild.
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:48.160]   So like, what we see right now
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:50.680]   with the New York Times and Clubhouse,
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:54.640]   this is a very, very, very, very, very intentional
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:55.840]   thing that is happening,
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:57.720]   which is that the Times,
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:00.360]   talking about unfettered conversations,
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:03.160]   that's happening on Clubhouse for people who aren't aware.
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:06.320]   This is important because they need
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:08.920]   to be the fetters of conversation.
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:11.640]   They need to be the interagent.
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:12.800]   That's where they get their power.
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:15.540]   They get their power from convincing Facebook
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:18.520]   that they are the ones who can fact-check stuff.
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:20.780]   They are the ones who can tell you
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:23.240]   whether something is right or wrong.
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:27.160]   That battle over unimpeded conversation
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:28.680]   and the explosion of a format
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:30.440]   that you and I are doing really well in,
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:32.720]   and then this more consolidated one,
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:35.320]   which holds cultural power and elite power,
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:38.320]   and more importantly, money, right, over you and I,
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:39.960]   that's the battle that we're all gonna play out.
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:41.840]   - Do you think unfettered conversations
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:43.680]   have a chance to win this battle?
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:45.400]   - Yes, I do, in the long run.
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:48.500]   In the long run, the internet is simply too powerful.
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:50.760]   But here's the mistake everybody makes.
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:52.240]   The New York Times will never lose.
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:53.780]   It will just become one of us.
[01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:54.880]   See-- - You think so?
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:55.720]   - They already are.
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:57.100]   They are the largest-- - The Daily?
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:58.820]   - The Daily, look at The Daily.
[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:01.240]   Not even that, think about it not in podcasting.
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:04.760]   The Times is not a mass media product.
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:08.480]   It is a subscription product for upper-middle class,
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:12.840]   largely white liberals who live the same circumstances
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.440]   across the United States and in Europe.
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:17.920]   There's nothing wrong with that, but here's the thing.
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:19.680]   You can't be the paper of record
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:21.600]   when you're actually the paper
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:23.560]   of upper-middle class white America.
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:27.040]   Your job is to report on the news from that angle
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:29.080]   and deliver them the product that they want.
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:30.580]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:32.600]   Their stock price is higher than ever.
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:34.120]   They're making 10 times more money
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.160]   than they did 10 years ago,
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:38.600]   but it comes at the cost
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:41.560]   of not having a mass application audience.
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:44.240]   So when people, I think people in our space
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:46.320]   are always like, "The New York Times is gonna be destroyed."
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:48.680]   No, it's actually even better.
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:50.600]   They will just become one of us.
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:51.520]   They already are.
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:53.120]   They're a subscription platform.
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:54.920]   - Well, yes, in terms of the actual mechanism,
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:58.060]   but New York Times is still,
[01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:00.440]   and I don't think I'm speaking about a particular sector.
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:03.840]   I think it, as a brand,
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:08.720]   it does have the level of credibility assigned to it still.
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:10.640]   There's politicization of it.
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:11.480]   - Totally.
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:14.000]   - But there's a credibility.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.560]   It has much more credibility than,
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:18.840]   forgive me, than I think you and I have.
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:20.120]   - No, you're right.
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:22.800]   - In terms of your podcast,
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:24.400]   people are not going to be like,
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:27.840]   they're gonna cite the New York Times
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:32.840]   versus what you said on the podcast for an opinion.
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:35.360]   I wonder, in the sense of battles,
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:36.960]   whether on federal conversations,
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:39.320]   whether Joe Rogan, whether your podcast
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:43.840]   can become the, have the same level of legitimacy
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:47.800]   or the flip side, New York Times loses legitimacy
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:50.920]   to be at the same level of,
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:52.680]   in terms of how we talk about it.
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:53.520]   - It's gonna be long.
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:54.520]   It's a long battle, right?
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:55.920]   It's gonna take a long time.
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:58.280]   And I'm saying, this is where I think the end state is going
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:57:59.560]   and look at what the Times is doing.
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:02.000]   They're leaning into podcasting for a reason,
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.200]   but not just podcasting as in NPR level,
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:07.760]   like here's what's happening.
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:10.320]   Michael Barbaro is a fucking celebrity, right?
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:11.760]   The guy who does the Daily.
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:14.920]   That guy's famous amongst these people
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:16.880]   'cause they're like, oh my God, I love Michael.
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:18.240]   Like I love the way he does this stuff.
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:19.400]   Again, that's fine.
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:20.720]   More people are listening to the news.
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:22.200]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:23.720]   And then who else do they hire?
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:27.560]   Ezra Klein from Vox, Kara Swisher, also from Vox,
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:30.400]   who does Pivot, which is an amazing podcast.
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:32.680]   Or Jane Koston, same thing.
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:36.320]   It's personalities who are becoming bundled together
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:38.240]   within this brand, right?
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:40.960]   - Here's, okay, maybe I'm just a hater.
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:42.800]   (Lex laughing)
[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:45.280]   'Cause I loved podcasting from the beginning.
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:48.440]   I loved Green Day before they were cool, man.
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:50.620]   But I'm bothered by it.
[01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:53.440]   Like why doesn't Kara Swisher, she's done successfully,
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:55.620]   I think in her own, no, she was always a part
[01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:57.560]   of some kind of institution, I'm not sure.
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:59:00.000]   - But she started her own thing, I think.
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.920]   - It would, anyway. - Recode, right, yeah.
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:03.520]   - Recode, I don't know if that's her own thing.
[01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:06.200]   Yeah, yeah, so she was very successful there.
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:08.760]   Why the hell did she join the New York Times
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:09.920]   with the new podcast?
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:13.120]   Why is Michael Barbaro not do his own thing?
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:14.920]   - 'Cause he gets paid, and because he has,
[01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:17.820]   he wants the elite cachet that you just referenced
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:19.900]   within his social circle in New York,
[01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:21.960]   which is that I think the biggest mistake
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:23.880]   that some of the venture people make is
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:26.640]   if we give everybody the tools that those people
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:29.680]   are all gonna leave to go sub-stack and go independent,
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:31.440]   within their social circle,
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:35.600]   sacrificing some money from being independent is worth it
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:38.080]   to be a part of the New York Times.
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:43.080]   - That's sad to me because it propagates old thinking.
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:46.400]   It propagates old institutions,
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:47.800]   and you could say that New York Times
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:49.680]   is going to evolve quickly and so on,
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:54.200]   but I would love it if there was a mechanism
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:57.360]   for reestablishing, for building new New York Times
[01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:59.960]   in terms of public legitimacy,
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:02.320]   and I suppose that's wishful thinking
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:06.320]   'cause it takes time to build trust in institutions,
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:08.400]   and it takes time to build new institutions.
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.520]   - My main thing I would say is public legitimacy
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:13.180]   as a concept is not gonna be there in mass media anymore.
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:15.920]   Because of the balkanization of audiences,
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:16.880]   I mean, think about it, right?
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:19.520]   Like this is like "Legion," you know,
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:21.920]   the classic stuff around 1,000 true fans,
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:24.520]   or no, sorry, like 100 true fans even now.
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:26.000]   Like you can make a living on the internet
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.600]   just talking to 100 people.
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:29.400]   If as long as they're all high-frequency traders,
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:32.480]   some of the highest paid people on Substack,
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:34.240]   they don't have that many subs.
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:36.080]   It's just that they're Wall Street guys, right?
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:37.160]   So people pay a lot of money.
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:38.640]   Again, that's great.
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:42.040]   So what you will have is an increasing balkanization
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:46.120]   of the internet, of audiences and of niches.
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:48.680]   People will become increasingly famous within this.
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:51.040]   You will become astoundingly famous.
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:52.480]   I'm sure you've noticed this for your fan base.
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:53.400]   I just certainly have with mine.
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:56.040]   Like 99% of people have no idea who I am,
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:57.040]   but when somebody meets, they're like,
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:00.920]   "Oh my God, I watch your show every day."
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:04.140]   Right, like it's the only thing I watch for news, right?
[02:01:04.140 --> 02:01:06.440]   Like instead of casually famous,
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:07.280]   if that makes sense, be like,
[02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:09.280]   "Oh yeah, that's like Alec Baldwin," you know?
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:10.680]   Like, "Oh shit, that's Alec Baldwin."
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:14.280]   But you're not like, "Oh shit, I love you, Alec Baldwin."
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:17.200]   This is a Ben Smith of the New York Times, actually.
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:18.040]   He wrote this column.
[02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:20.160]   He's like, "The future is everybody will be famous,
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:22.720]   but only to a small group of people."
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:24.160]   And I think that is true.
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:26.120]   But again, I don't decry it.
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:28.440]   I think it's great because I think that the more
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:31.000]   that that happens, the more engaged people will be,
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:34.560]   and it empowers different voices to be able to come in
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:36.500]   and then possibly, I wouldn't say destroy,
[02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:37.960]   but compete against.
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:39.200]   I mean, look at Joe.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:43.280]   Joe is more powerful than CNN and MSNBC
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:45.120]   and Fox all put together.
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.560]   That gives me like immense inspiration.
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:50.040]   Like he created the space for me to succeed.
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:51.200]   And I told him that when I met him.
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:54.280]   I was like, "Dude, like I listened to his podcast
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:55.480]   when I was like young."
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:58.020]   And like, I remember like when I got to meet him
[02:01:58.020 --> 02:02:00.260]   and all that, and I told him this on this pod,
[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:02.840]   I was like, "I didn't know people were millions
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:05.400]   were willing to listen to a guy talk about chimps
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:08.080]   for three straight hours, including me."
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:09.800]   I didn't know that I could be one of those people.
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:10.640]   - Yeah, me too.
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:12.760]   I learned something about myself before the show, yeah.
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:15.280]   - And so by creating that space, I'd be like,
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:17.460]   "Wait, there's a hunger here."
[02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:20.240]   Like he showed us all the way.
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:22.400]   And none of us will ever again be as famous as Rogan
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:23.560]   'cause he was the first.
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:27.480]   And that's fine because he created the umbrella ecosystem
[02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:29.120]   for us all to thrive.
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:32.400]   That is where I see like a great amount of hope
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:33.440]   within that story.
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:34.280]   - Yeah, and the cool thing,
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:35.880]   he also supports that ecosystem.
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:38.160]   He's such a-- - He's so generous.
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:40.960]   - One of the things he paved the way on for me
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:45.960]   is to show that you can just be honest, publicly honest.
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:51.320]   And not jealous of other people's success,
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:54.600]   but instead of be supportive and all those kinds of things,
[02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:56.120]   just like loving towards others.
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:57.320]   He's been an inspiration.
[02:02:57.320 --> 02:03:01.240]   I mean, to the comics community,
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:04.480]   I think there are a bunch of, before that,
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:06.920]   I think there were all a bunch of competitive haters
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:07.880]   towards each other. - They were, yeah.
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:10.320]   And now he's like just injected love.
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:11.200]   - Yeah. - You know?
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:12.040]   - They're like, they're still,
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:13.600]   like many are still resistant,
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:15.080]   but they're like, they can't help it
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:17.120]   'cause he's such a huge voice.
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:20.160]   He like forces them to be like loving towards each other.
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:22.440]   And the same, I try to,
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:25.320]   one of the reasons I wanted to start this podcast
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:28.680]   was to try to, I wanted to be like,
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:33.960]   do what Joe Rogan did, but for the scientific community,
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:36.040]   like my little circle of scientific community
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:38.600]   of like, let's support each other.
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:40.400]   - Yeah, well, like Avi Loeb,
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.920]   I would have no idea who he was if it wasn't for you.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:44.920]   I mean, I assume you put him in touch with Joe.
[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:45.760]   He went on Joe's show.
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:47.000]   I had him on my show.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.560]   Like millions of people would have no idea who he was
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:50.400]   if it wasn't for you.
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:51.920]   - Just by the way, in terms of deep state
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:54.760]   and shadow government, Avi Loeb has to do with aliens.
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:56.760]   You better believe Joe.
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.400]   - Dude, the last thing I sent to him
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:00.480]   was the American Airlines audio.
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:02.120]   Did you see that?
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:04.960]   The pilots who were, oh my God, dude, this is amazing.
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:07.280]   So like, I'm like getting excited.
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:10.440]   This American Airlines flight crew was over New Mexico,
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:12.240]   this happened five or six days ago.
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:14.360]   And the guy comes and he goes,
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:16.320]   hey, do you have any targets up here?
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:20.560]   A large cylindrical object just flew over me.
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:21.880]   - Oh no. - Okay, so this happens.
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:23.200]   So this happens. - Yes.
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:26.560]   - Then a guy or like a radio catcher
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:29.080]   records this and posts it online.
[02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:33.440]   American Airlines confirms that this is authentic audio.
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:35.440]   And they go, all further questions
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:37.120]   should be referred to the FBI.
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:39.760]   So then, okay, American Airlines just confirmed
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:42.440]   it's a legitimate transmission, FBI.
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:45.760]   Then the FAA comes out and says,
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:50.760]   we were tracking no objects in the vicinity of this plane
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:52.480]   at the time of the transmission.
[02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:54.600]   So the only plausible explanation
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:56.120]   that online sleuths have been able to say
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:04:58.840]   is maybe he saw a Learjet,
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:02.200]   which was using like open source data.
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:03.960]   FAA rules that out.
[02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:05.280]   So what was it?
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:07.360]   He saw a large cylindrical object
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:09.680]   while he was mid-flight, American Airlines.
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:12.960]   But you can go online, listen to the audio yourself.
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:15.680]   This is a 100% no shit transmission,
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:19.840]   confirmed by American Airlines of a commercial pilot
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:23.200]   over New Mexico, seeing a quote unquote,
[02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:26.040]   large cylindrical object in the air.
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:28.200]   Like I said, when we first started talking,
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:31.160]   I've never believed more in UFOs than aliens.
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:33.160]   - Yeah, this is awesome.
[02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:34.000]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.520]   - I just wish both American Airlines, FBI,
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:40.000]   and government would be more transparent.
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.080]   Like there would be voices.
[02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:43.280]   I know it sounds ridiculous,
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:45.280]   but the kind of transparency that you see,
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:48.920]   maybe not Joe Rogan, he's like overly transparent,
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:49.960]   he's just a comic really.
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:54.080]   But just, I don't know, like a podcast from the FBI.
[02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:55.080]   (laughs)
[02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:58.960]   Just like being honest, like excited, confused.
[02:05:58.960 --> 02:06:03.120]   I'm sure they're being overly cautious
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:04.520]   about their release information.
[02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:05.960]   I'm sure there's a lot of information
[02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:07.560]   that would inspire the public,
[02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:09.480]   that would inspire trust in institutions
[02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:12.320]   that will not damage national security.
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:14.240]   Like it seems to me obvious.
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:15.480]   And the reason they're not sharing it
[02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:17.800]   is because of this momentum of bureaucracy,
[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:19.400]   of caution, and so on.
[02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:21.560]   But there's probably so much cool information
[02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:22.720]   that the government has.
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:26.600]   - The way I almost, I wouldn't say it confirmed it's real,
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:28.960]   but Trump didn't declassify it.
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:31.320]   Like you know that if there was ever a president
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:32.760]   that actually wanted to get to the bottom of it,
[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:33.600]   it was him.
[02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:34.800]   - Yeah.
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:37.120]   - I mean, he didn't declassify it, man.
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:38.400]   And people begged him to.
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:40.680]   I know for a fact, 'cause I pushed
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:41.960]   to try and make this happen,
[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:44.320]   that some people did speak to him about it.
[02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:46.440]   And he was like, "No, I'm not gonna do it."
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:47.280]   So.
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:48.560]   - He might be afraid.
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:49.720]   - That's what I mean though.
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:50.560]   They were probably all telling him,
[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:52.480]   "Sir, you can't do this, all this."
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:53.320]   Like, wow.
[02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:54.160]   And I get that.
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:56.400]   And there's this legislation written as COVID
[02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:58.640]   that like they have six months to release it.
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:06:59.480]   - Is that real?
[02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:00.300]   What is that?
[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:01.140]   Is that a bunch of bullshit?
[02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:01.960]   - I think it's bullshit.
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:02.800]   I think it's bullshit.
[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:04.280]   There's so many different levels of classification
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:05.840]   that people need to understand.
[02:07:05.840 --> 02:07:07.960]   I mean, look, I read John Podesta.
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:10.360]   He was the chief of staff to Bill Clinton.
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:11.560]   He's a big UFO guy.
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:14.840]   He tried, like him and Clinton tried
[02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:15.920]   to get some of this information
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:17.880]   and they could not get any of it.
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:19.680]   And we're talking about the president
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:21.340]   and the White House chief of staff.
[02:07:21.340 --> 02:07:22.800]   - Well, there's a whole bureaucracy built
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:24.640]   just like you're saying with intent.
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:27.080]   You have to be like, that has to be your focus
[02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:29.840]   because there's a whole bureaucracy built around secrecy
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:31.160]   for probably for a good reason.
[02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:33.720]   So to get through to the information,
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:35.440]   there's a whole like paperwork process,
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:36.280]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.880]   You can't just walk in and get the,
[02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:40.920]   unless again, with intention, that becomes your thing.
[02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:41.760]   - Exactly.
[02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:44.000]   - Like let's revolutionize this thing.
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000]   And then you get only so many things.
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:50.840]   It's sad that the bureaucracy has gotten so bulky.
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:53.080]   But I think the hopeful message is
[02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:54.440]   from earlier in our conversation,
[02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:57.800]   it seems like a single person can't fix it.
[02:07:57.800 --> 02:08:02.000]   But if you hire the right team, it feels like you can.
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.040]   - Can't fix everything.
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:05.580]   I don't wanna give people unrealistic expectations.
[02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:08.000]   You can fix a lot, especially in crisis,
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.240]   you can remake America.
[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:10.080]   - Yeah.
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:12.600]   - And all of that is 'cause it's already happened twice.
[02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:17.160]   FDR, or in modern history, FDR and JFK.
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:20.920]   But sorry, FDR and JFK's assassination, LBJ.
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:25.500]   Two hyper-competent men who understood government,
[02:08:25.500 --> 02:08:27.160]   who understood personnel,
[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:28.480]   and coincidentally were friends.
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:29.300]   I love this.
[02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:31.040]   I don't think actually people understand this.
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:35.720]   FDR met Johnson three days after he won
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:38.600]   his election to Congress, special election.
[02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:40.320]   He was only 29 years old.
[02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:44.200]   And he left that meeting and called somebody and said,
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:45.640]   "This young man is gonna be president
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:46.960]   of the United States someday."
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:50.120]   Like, even then, what was within him
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:52.000]   to understand and to recognize that?
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.400]   And sometimes Johnson, as a young member of Congress,
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:56.320]   would come and have breakfast with FDR.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:58.820]   Like, just two of the great political minds
[02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:01.360]   of the 20th century just sitting there talking.
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:03.000]   Like, I would give anything
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.760]   to know what was happening.
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:06.360]   - I hope they were real with each other.
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:08.520]   And there was like a genuine human connection, right?
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:10.000]   That seems to be-
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.400]   - Well, Johnson wasn't a genuine guy.
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:13.560]   So we're almost certainly not.
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:16.520]   - Well, I need to read those thousands of pages.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:19.720]   I've been way too focused on Hitler.
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:22.880]   - I was gonna say, one of my goals in coming to this
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:24.560]   is I was like, I gotta get Lex into two things,
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:25.600]   'cause I know he'll love it.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:29.240]   I know he'll love LBJ if he has the time to read the books.
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:30.080]   - Really?
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:31.200]   - 100%.
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:32.760]   He's the most- - Of all the presidents?
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:33.680]   - I didn't say you'll love him,
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:34.960]   but you'll love the books about him.
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:37.520]   Because the books are a story of America,
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:39.600]   the story of politics, the story of power.
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:41.320]   This is the guy who wrote "The Power Broker."
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:44.040]   These books are up there with
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:46.240]   "Decline and Follow the Roman Empire"
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:48.840]   by Edward Gibbon in terms of how power works.
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:49.800]   - Study of power.
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:50.640]   - Exactly.
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:52.840]   - No, that's why Carroll wrote the books.
[02:09:52.840 --> 02:09:55.600]   And that's why the books are not really about LBJ.
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:57.440]   They're about power in Washington
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:00.200]   and about the consolidation of power post New Deal.
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:01.780]   The consolidation then,
[02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:04.640]   or using the levers of power like Johnson knew
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:08.000]   in order to change the House of Representatives,
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.520]   the Senate of the United States,
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:11.500]   and ultimately the presidency of the United States,
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:13.920]   which ended in failure and disaster with Vietnam.
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:14.960]   Don't get me wrong.
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:18.840]   But he's overlooked for so many of the incredible things
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:19.960]   that he did with civil rights.
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:21.520]   Nobody else could have done it.
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:23.960]   No one else could have gotten it done.
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:27.280]   And the second thing is we gotta get you into World War I.
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:29.640]   We gotta get you more into World War I
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:31.860]   because I think that's a rabbit hole,
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:33.600]   which I know you're a Dan Carlin fan.
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:35.320]   So blueprint for Armageddon.
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:36.160]   - Yeah, it's good.
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:37.440]   - Guaranteed.
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:40.000]   - But there's fewer evil people there.
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.720]   - Yes, but that's what actually,
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:45.480]   there's a banality of that evil,
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:50.240]   of the Kaiser and of the Austro-Hungarians.
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:54.440]   And see, I like World War I more because it was unresolved.
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:56.080]   It's one of those periods I was talking to you about,
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:58.840]   about sometimes you're called and you fail.
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:10:59.680]   That's what happened.
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:02.240]   I mean, 50 million people were killed
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:04.000]   in the most horrific way.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.400]   People literally drowned in the mud,
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.200]   like an entire generation.
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:13.040]   One stat I love is that Britain didn't need a draft
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:15.000]   till 1916.
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.000]   They went two years of throwing people
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.600]   into barbed wire voluntarily.
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:22.640]   And because people loved their country
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:23.800]   and they loved the king,
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:26.320]   and they thought they were going against the Kaiser,
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:28.480]   it's just like that conflict to me,
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:30.160]   I just can't read enough about it.
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:34.560]   Also just like births Russian revolution, Hitler.
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:37.000]   - You can't talk about World War II without World War I.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.200]   - Right, and I'm obsessed with the conflict.
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:40.800]   I've read way too many books about it.
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:42.920]   For this reason is it's unresolved.
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:46.200]   And the roots of so much of even our current problems
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:48.280]   are happened in Versailles.
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:51.760]   Vietnam is because of the Treaty of Versailles.
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:53.480]   Many ways, the Middle Eastern problems
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:55.320]   and the division of the states there,
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:57.500]   the Treaty of Versailles in terms of the penalties
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:12:01.820]   against Germany, but also the fallout from those wars
[02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:03.940]   on the French and the German population,
[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:05.380]   or the French and the British populations
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:10.380]   and their reluctance for war in 1939 or 1938
[02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:12.940]   when Neville Chamberlain goes.
[02:12:12.940 --> 02:12:14.060]   One of the things people don't understand
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:16.540]   is the actual appetite of the British public at that time.
[02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:18.540]   They didn't wanna go to war, only Churchill.
[02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:21.940]   He was the only one in the gathering storm,
[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:24.980]   being like, "Hey, this is really bad," and all of that.
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:26.500]   And then even in the United States,
[02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:28.860]   our streak of isolationism, which swept,
[02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:32.100]   I mean, things were, because of that conflict,
[02:12:32.100 --> 02:12:34.780]   we were convinced as a country
[02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:37.980]   that we wanted nothing to do with Europe and its problems.
[02:12:37.980 --> 02:12:39.500]   And in many ways, that contributed
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:41.320]   to the proliferation of Hitler and more.
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:43.980]   So I'm obsessed with World War I for this reason,
[02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:46.060]   which is that it's just like the root,
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:48.660]   it's like the culmination of the monarchies,
[02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:51.900]   then the fall, and then just all the shit spills out
[02:12:51.900 --> 02:12:53.620]   from there for like 100 years.
[02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:56.300]   - So World War I is like the most important shift
[02:12:56.300 --> 02:12:58.700]   in human history, versus World War II
[02:12:58.700 --> 02:13:00.420]   is like a consequence of that.
[02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:03.060]   - Yeah, so I have a degree in security studies
[02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:04.900]   from Georgetown, and one of the thing is
[02:13:04.900 --> 02:13:07.580]   that we would focus a lot on that is like war,
[02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:11.100]   but also the complexity around war.
[02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:13.800]   And it's funny, we never spent that much time
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:17.420]   on World War II, 'cause it was actually quite a clean war.
[02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:21.620]   It's a very atypical war, as in the war object,
[02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:23.260]   which we learned from World War I,
[02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:26.660]   is we must inflict suffering on the German people
[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:30.580]   and invade the borders of Germany and destroy Hitler.
[02:13:30.580 --> 02:13:34.320]   Like the center of gravity is the Nazi regime and Hitler.
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:37.380]   So it had a very basic begin and end.
[02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:40.660]   Begin, liberate France, invade Germany,
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:44.060]   destroy Hitler, reoccupy, rebuild.
[02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:46.860]   World War I, what are you fighting for?
[02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:50.180]   I mean, nobody even knew.
[02:13:50.180 --> 02:13:52.100]   The German general staff, they were like,
[02:13:52.100 --> 02:13:54.900]   even in 1917, they're like, the war was worth it
[02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:56.200]   because now we have Luxembourg.
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:57.040]   I'm like, really?
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:13:58.420]   You killed two million of your citizens
[02:13:58.420 --> 02:13:59.760]   for fucking Luxembourg?
[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:02.660]   And like half of Belgium, which is now like a pond?
[02:14:02.660 --> 02:14:04.980]   And same thing, the French are like,
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:07.500]   well, the French more so, they're defending their borders,
[02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:09.500]   but like, what are the British fighting for?
[02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:11.540]   Why did hundreds of thousands of British people die?
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:14.340]   In order to preserve the balance of power in Europe
[02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:17.420]   and prevent the Kaiser from having a port
[02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:19.300]   on the English Channel?
[02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:21.420]   Like, really, that's why?
[02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:24.380]   That's more what wars are, is they become these like,
[02:14:24.380 --> 02:14:29.380]   atypical, they become these protracted conflicts
[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:33.260]   with a necessary diplomatic resolution
[02:14:33.260 --> 02:14:36.260]   that's not clean, it's very dirty,
[02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:38.900]   it usually leads in the outbreak of another war
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:40.020]   and another war and another war
[02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:43.100]   and a slow burn of ethnic conflict, which bubbles up.
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:45.820]   So that's why I look at that one,
[02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:49.060]   'cause it's more typical of warfare in terms of how it works.
[02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:51.260]   - Exactly, it's kind of interesting,
[02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:54.340]   you're making me realize that World War II
[02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:57.860]   is one of the rare wars where you can make a strong case
[02:14:57.860 --> 02:14:59.700]   for it's a fight of good versus evil.
[02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:01.180]   - Yeah, just war theory, obviously,
[02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:02.880]   like they're literally slaughtering Jews,
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:04.300]   like we have to kill them.
[02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:05.820]   - And there's one person doing it,
[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:07.820]   I mean, there's one person at the core,
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:11.320]   yeah, that's fascinating.
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:14.240]   And it's short and there's a clear aggression.
[02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:18.780]   - It's interesting that Dan Carlin
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:21.060]   has been avoiding Hitler as well.
[02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:24.020]   - Yeah, probably for this reason.
[02:15:24.020 --> 02:15:25.740]   - Probably for this reason, I mean,
[02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:28.900]   but it's complicated too, because there's a pressure,
[02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:30.260]   that guy has his demons.
[02:15:30.260 --> 02:15:31.700]   I love Dan so much.
[02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:36.700]   I don't know if you feel this pressure,
[02:15:36.700 --> 02:15:39.140]   but as a creative, he feels the pressure
[02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:42.980]   of being maybe not necessarily correct,
[02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:48.540]   but maybe correct in the sense that his understanding,
[02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:53.540]   he gets to the bottom of why something happened,
[02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:59.540]   of what really happened, get to the bottom of it
[02:15:59.540 --> 02:16:02.540]   before he can say something publicly about it.
[02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:04.900]   And he is tortured by that burden.
[02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:06.980]   - I know, he takes so much shit
[02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:09.220]   from the historical community for no reason.
[02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:11.580]   I think he's the greatest popularizer,
[02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:13.300]   quote unquote, of history.
[02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:17.100]   And I wish more people in history understood it that way.
[02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:18.380]   He was an inspiration to me.
[02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:21.180]   I mean, I do some videos sometimes on my Instagram now,
[02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:22.940]   where I'll do like a book tour.
[02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:24.700]   I'll be like, here's my bookshelf of these presidents.
[02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:26.140]   And like, here's what I learned from this book,
[02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:26.980]   and this book, and this,
[02:16:26.980 --> 02:16:30.700]   and that was very much like a skill I learned from him
[02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:33.980]   of being like, as the historian writes.
[02:16:33.980 --> 02:16:34.820]   (both laughing)
[02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:38.180]   I just love the way he talks, he's like, in the mud.
[02:16:38.180 --> 02:16:39.660]   Or he'll be like, quote.
[02:16:39.660 --> 02:16:42.420]   (both laughing)
[02:16:42.420 --> 02:16:44.700]   He inspires me, man.
[02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:46.660]   He really does to like learn more.
[02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:48.740]   And I've read, I bought a lot of books
[02:16:48.740 --> 02:16:50.940]   because of Dan Carlin, because of this guy,
[02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:52.260]   because of that guy.
[02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:53.980]   In terms of, you know another thing he does,
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:56.220]   which nobody else, and I'm probably guilty of this,
[02:16:56.220 --> 02:16:59.420]   he focuses on the actual people involved.
[02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:03.300]   Like he would tell the story of actual British soldiers
[02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:04.580]   in World War I.
[02:17:04.580 --> 02:17:07.100]   And I probably, and maybe you're guilty of this too,
[02:17:07.100 --> 02:17:09.740]   we over-focus on what was happening
[02:17:09.740 --> 02:17:11.020]   in the German general staff,
[02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:12.780]   what was happening in the British general staff.
[02:17:12.780 --> 02:17:14.220]   And he doesn't make that mistake.
[02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:16.100]   That's what he tells real history.
[02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:18.700]   Yeah, and it gives it a feeling.
[02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:20.540]   The result is that there's a feeling,
[02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:22.900]   you get the feeling of what it was like to be there.
[02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:24.300]   Exactly.
[02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:25.940]   You know, you're becoming,
[02:17:25.940 --> 02:17:28.120]   quickly becoming more and more popular.
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:32.940]   Speaking about political issues in part,
[02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:38.500]   do you feel a burden, like almost like
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:43.660]   the prison of your prior convictions
[02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:47.660]   of having to, being popular with a certain kind of audience
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:51.380]   and thereby unable to really think outside the box?
[02:17:51.380 --> 02:17:54.460]   I have, I've really struggled with this.
[02:17:54.460 --> 02:17:56.380]   I came up in right-wing media.
[02:17:56.380 --> 02:18:00.220]   I came up a much more doctrinaire,
[02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:02.100]   conservative in my professional life.
[02:18:02.100 --> 02:18:02.980]   I wasn't always conservative.
[02:18:02.980 --> 02:18:05.260]   We can get to that later if you want.
[02:18:05.260 --> 02:18:09.860]   And I did feel an immense pressure
[02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:14.860]   after the election by people to say,
[02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:17.620]   wanted me to say the election was stolen.
[02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:21.660]   And I knew that I had a sizable part of my audience.
[02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:22.820]   Oh, well, here's the benefit.
[02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:24.260]   Most people know me from "Rising,"
[02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:26.220]   which is with Crystal and me.
[02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:29.440]   That is inherently a left-right program.
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:31.260]   So it's a large audience.
[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:35.540]   So I felt comfortable and I knew that I could still be fine
[02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:37.320]   in terms of my numbers, whatever,
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:40.300]   because many people knew me who were on the left.
[02:18:40.300 --> 02:18:44.660]   And if my right listeners abandoned me, so be it.
[02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:47.100]   I had the luxury of able to take that choice,
[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:51.020]   but I still felt an immense amount of pressure
[02:18:51.020 --> 02:18:52.780]   to say the election was stolen,
[02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:55.500]   to give credence to a lot of the stuff that Trump was doing,
[02:18:55.500 --> 02:18:57.740]   to downplay January 6th,
[02:18:57.740 --> 02:19:00.100]   to downplay many of the Republican senators
[02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:01.900]   or justify many of the Republican senators,
[02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:03.300]   some of whom I know,
[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:06.180]   who objected to the electoral college certification
[02:19:06.180 --> 02:19:08.900]   and who stoked some of the flames
[02:19:08.900 --> 02:19:11.700]   that have eaten the Republican base.
[02:19:11.700 --> 02:19:13.540]   And I just wouldn't do it.
[02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:15.380]   And that was hard, man.
[02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:19.860]   Like, I feel more politically homeless right now
[02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:21.660]   than I ever have,
[02:19:21.660 --> 02:19:24.660]   but I have realized in the last couple of months
[02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:26.300]   that's the best thing that ever happened to me.
[02:19:26.300 --> 02:19:27.140]   - It's freedom.
[02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:28.620]   - It's true freedom.
[02:19:28.620 --> 02:19:32.700]   I now, I say exactly what I think.
[02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:34.980]   And it's not that I wasn't doing that before.
[02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:38.160]   It's maybe I would avoid certain topics
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:40.700]   or like I would think about things
[02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:42.820]   more from a team perspective of like,
[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:45.540]   am I making sure that it's,
[02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:46.780]   I'm not saying I didn't fight it.
[02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:48.780]   And I still, I criticized the right plenty
[02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:51.460]   and Trump plenty before the election and more.
[02:19:51.460 --> 02:19:52.900]   It's more just like,
[02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:56.620]   I no longer feel as if I even have the illusion
[02:19:56.620 --> 02:19:58.620]   of a stake within the game.
[02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:02.420]   I'm like, I only look at myself as an outside observer
[02:20:02.420 --> 02:20:05.660]   and I will only call it as I see it truly.
[02:20:05.660 --> 02:20:08.420]   And I was aspiring to that before,
[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:11.900]   but I had to have, in a way,
[02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:13.520]   Trump stopped the steel thing.
[02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:16.180]   It like took my shackles off 100%.
[02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:17.700]   'Cause I was like, no, this is bullshit.
[02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:19.060]   And I'm gonna say it's bullshit.
[02:20:19.060 --> 02:20:20.260]   And I think it's bad.
[02:20:20.260 --> 02:20:22.420]   And I think it's bad for the Republican party.
[02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:24.180]   And if people in the Republican party
[02:20:24.180 --> 02:20:26.860]   don't agree with me on that, that's fine.
[02:20:26.860 --> 02:20:29.060]   I'm just not gonna be necessarily
[02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:30.940]   like associated with you anymore.
[02:20:30.940 --> 02:20:32.780]   - This is probably one of the first political,
[02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:35.980]   liberal politics-related conversations we've had.
[02:20:35.980 --> 02:20:38.780]   I mean, unless you count Michael Malice, who--
[02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:39.620]   - He was great.
[02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:41.540]   (laughing)
[02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:42.540]   He's a funny guy.
[02:20:42.540 --> 02:20:44.860]   - He's not so much political as he is like,
[02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:46.340]   burning down man.
[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:47.580]   (laughing)
[02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:50.020]   - He leans too far into anarchy for me.
[02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:52.020]   - Yeah, I think he's--
[02:20:52.020 --> 02:20:53.300]   - There's a place for that.
[02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:54.980]   - It's almost, well, first of all,
[02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:58.020]   he's working on a new book, which I really appreciate.
[02:20:58.020 --> 02:21:00.900]   Outside of, he's working on like a big book for a while,
[02:21:00.900 --> 02:21:02.380]   which is White Pill.
[02:21:02.380 --> 02:21:07.140]   He's also working on this like short little thing,
[02:21:07.140 --> 02:21:11.700]   which is like anarchist handbook or something like that.
[02:21:11.700 --> 02:21:14.580]   It's like Anarchy for Idiots or something like that.
[02:21:14.580 --> 02:21:16.100]   Which I think is really--
[02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:16.940]   - I like that name, but.
[02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:19.100]   (laughing)
[02:21:19.100 --> 02:21:22.540]   - Well, me being an idiot and being curious about anarchy
[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:24.700]   just seems useful, so I like those kinds of books.
[02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:26.060]   - That's Russian heritage, man.
[02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:26.900]   - Yeah.
[02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:28.300]   - Anarchist 101, yeah.
[02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:33.300]   - I find those kinds of things a useful thought experiment
[02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:37.860]   because that's why, it's frustrating to me
[02:21:37.860 --> 02:21:40.500]   when people talk about communism, socialism,
[02:21:40.500 --> 02:21:43.780]   or even capitalism, where they can't enjoy
[02:21:43.780 --> 02:21:48.780]   the thought experiment of like, why did communism fail
[02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:53.340]   and maybe ask the question of like,
[02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:55.540]   is it possible to make communism succeed
[02:21:55.540 --> 02:21:57.380]   or are there good ideas in communism?
[02:21:57.380 --> 02:21:58.980]   Like I enjoy the thought experiment,
[02:21:58.980 --> 02:22:02.460]   like the discourse of it, like the reasoning
[02:22:02.460 --> 02:22:04.580]   and like devil's advocate and all that.
[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:07.140]   People seem to not have patience for that.
[02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:09.300]   They're like, communism bad, red.
[02:22:09.300 --> 02:22:11.620]   - I was obsessed with the question and still am.
[02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:16.260]   I will never be, I will never quench my thirst
[02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:18.500]   for Russian history.
[02:22:18.500 --> 02:22:23.500]   I love that period of 1890 to 1925.
[02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:30.220]   It's just like, it's so fucking crazy.
[02:22:30.220 --> 02:22:35.020]   Like the autocracy embodied in Czar Alexander.
[02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:38.820]   And then you get this like weird fail son, Nicholas,
[02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:42.240]   who is kind of a good guy, but also terrible.
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:45.020]   And also Russian autocracy itself is terrible.
[02:22:45.020 --> 02:22:47.620]   And then I just became obsessed with the question of like,
[02:22:47.620 --> 02:22:49.580]   why did the Bolshevik revolution succeed?
[02:22:49.580 --> 02:22:51.340]   Because like people in Russia
[02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:53.940]   didn't necessarily want Bolshevism.
[02:22:53.940 --> 02:22:56.420]   People suffered a lot under Bolshevism
[02:22:56.420 --> 02:22:58.120]   and it led to Stalinism.
[02:22:58.120 --> 02:23:01.140]   How did Vladimir Lenin do it, right?
[02:23:01.140 --> 02:23:04.540]   Like, and I became obsessed with that question.
[02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:06.380]   And it's still, I find it so interesting,
[02:23:06.380 --> 02:23:10.640]   which is that series of accidents of history,
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:13.820]   incredible boldness by Lenin,
[02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:18.820]   incredible realpolitik, smart, unpopular decisions
[02:23:18.820 --> 02:23:21.780]   made by Trotsky and Stalin,
[02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:25.440]   and just like the arrogance of the czars
[02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:30.440]   and of the Russian like autocracy.
[02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:32.280]   And just, but at the same time,
[02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:35.220]   there's all these like cultural implications of this, right?
[02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:37.700]   In terms of like how it became hollowed out
[02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:40.140]   post Catherine the Great and all that.
[02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:41.380]   I was obsessed with autocracy
[02:23:41.380 --> 02:23:44.120]   because Russia was an actual autocracy.
[02:23:44.120 --> 02:23:46.260]   And like actually, and I'm like, it was there.
[02:23:46.260 --> 02:23:49.300]   Like they didn't even remove serfdom
[02:23:49.300 --> 02:23:51.780]   to like the civil war in America.
[02:23:51.780 --> 02:23:52.980]   Like that's crazy.
[02:23:52.980 --> 02:23:55.900]   Like, you know, and nobody really talks about it.
[02:23:55.900 --> 02:23:57.980]   And I just became, yeah, I was like,
[02:23:57.980 --> 02:24:01.140]   was Bolshevism a natural reaction
[02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:03.940]   to the excesses of czarism?
[02:24:03.940 --> 02:24:07.340]   There is a convenient explanation where that is true,
[02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:10.000]   but there were also a series of decisions
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.140]   made by Lenin and Stalin to kill many of the people
[02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:15.420]   in the center left and marginalize them,
[02:24:15.420 --> 02:24:19.260]   and also not to associate with the more quote unquote,
[02:24:19.260 --> 02:24:24.080]   like amenable communists in order to make sure
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:28.080]   that their pure strain of Bolshevism was the only thing.
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:29.980]   And the reason I like that is because it comes back
[02:24:29.980 --> 02:24:31.460]   to a point I made earlier.
[02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:32.780]   It's all about intentionality,
[02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:35.820]   which is that you actually can will something
[02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:38.500]   into existence, even if people don't want it.
[02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:39.500]   That was the craziest thing.
[02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:41.380]   Like nobody wanted this,
[02:24:41.380 --> 02:24:44.060]   but it still ruled for half a century,
[02:24:44.060 --> 02:24:47.660]   more actually, I mean, almost, you know, 75 years.
[02:24:47.660 --> 02:24:50.180]   - To think that there could have been a history
[02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:55.180]   of the Soviet Union that was dramatically different
[02:24:55.180 --> 02:25:00.860]   than Leninism, Stalinism, that was completely different,
[02:25:00.860 --> 02:25:03.020]   like almost would be the American story.
[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:04.340]   - Yeah, easily.
[02:25:04.340 --> 02:25:06.340]   I mean, there's a world where,
[02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:07.820]   and I don't have all the characters.
[02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:10.380]   There's like Kerensky, and then there was like,
[02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:12.940]   whoever Lenin's number two, Stalin's chief rival.
[02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:15.900]   And even, I mean, look, even a Soviet Union led by Trotsky,
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:17.340]   that's a whole other world, right?
[02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:19.420]   Like literally a whole other world.
[02:25:19.420 --> 02:25:21.620]   And yeah, it's just, I don't know.
[02:25:21.620 --> 02:25:22.500]   I find it so interesting.
[02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:24.540]   I will never not be fascinated by Russia.
[02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:25.660]   I always will.
[02:25:25.660 --> 02:25:26.900]   It's funny that I get to talk to you,
[02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:28.620]   'cause it's like, I read this book.
[02:25:28.620 --> 02:25:29.460]   I forget what it's called.
[02:25:29.460 --> 02:25:31.220]   It won, I think it won a Pulitzer Prize.
[02:25:31.220 --> 02:25:34.580]   And it was like the story of,
[02:25:34.580 --> 02:25:37.420]   I tried to understand Russia post Crimea,
[02:25:37.420 --> 02:25:40.100]   'cause I came up amongst people
[02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:41.700]   who are much more like neoconservative,
[02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:43.900]   and they're like, "Fuck Russia, Russia, bad."
[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:46.260]   And I was like, "Okay, what do these people think?"
[02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:48.260]   And we have this narrative
[02:25:48.260 --> 02:25:49.860]   of like the fall of the Soviet Union.
[02:25:49.860 --> 02:25:52.980]   And then I read this book from the perspective of Russians
[02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:54.180]   who lived through the fall.
[02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:56.020]   And they were like, "This is, I was like, this is terrible.
[02:25:56.020 --> 02:25:59.420]   "Like actually the introduction of capitalism was awful.
[02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:02.980]   "And like the rise of all these crazy oligarchs,
[02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:06.560]   "that's why Putin came to power,
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:11.560]   "to like restore order to the oligarchy."
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:13.220]   - And he still talks to this day.
[02:26:13.220 --> 02:26:15.540]   Do you guys, I mean, that's always the threat of like,
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:17.220]   do you wanna return to the '90s?
[02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:18.060]   - Right.
[02:26:18.060 --> 02:26:19.380]   - Do you want to return to- - To Yeltsin.
[02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:20.380]   - Yeah. - And like,
[02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:21.660]   but the thing is in the West,
[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:23.940]   we have this like our own propaganda of like,
[02:26:23.940 --> 02:26:25.040]   no, Yeltsin was great.
[02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:26.000]   That was the golden age.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:27.660]   What could have been with Russia?
[02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:30.020]   And I was like, "Well, what do actual Russians think?"
[02:26:30.020 --> 02:26:34.300]   And so that, yeah, I'll always be fascinated by it.
[02:26:34.300 --> 02:26:37.960]   And then just like to understand the idea
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:41.320]   of feeling encircled by NATO and all of that,
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:44.500]   you have to understand like Russian defense theory,
[02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:46.460]   all the way going back to the czars,
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:48.960]   has always been defense in depth
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:51.800]   in terms of having Estonia, Lithuania,
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:54.560]   and more is like protection of the heartland.
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:55.600]   I'm not justifying in this,
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:57.920]   so NATO shills, like, please don't come after me.
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:01.200]   But, and look, Estonians like NATO.
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:02.040]   They wanna be in NATO.
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:03.080]   So I don't wanna minimize that.
[02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:04.320]   I'm more just saying like,
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:08.920]   I understand him and Russia much better having done that.
[02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:11.580]   And we are very incapable in America.
[02:27:11.580 --> 02:27:13.280]   I think this is probably 'cause my parents are immigrants
[02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:14.320]   and I've traveled a lot,
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:17.320]   of putting yourself in the mind of people
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:21.060]   who aren't Western and haven't lived a history,
[02:27:21.060 --> 02:27:23.320]   especially our lives of America's fucking awesome.
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:25.040]   We're the number one country in the world.
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:26.480]   I'm like, we're literally better than you,
[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:27.960]   like in many ways.
[02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:31.380]   And they can't empathize with people
[02:27:31.380 --> 02:27:33.740]   who have suffered so much.
[02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:36.060]   And I just, yeah, it's just so interesting to me.
[02:27:36.060 --> 02:27:38.800]   - What about if we could talk for just a brief moment
[02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:42.800]   about the human of Putin and power.
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:46.960]   You are clearly fascinated by power.
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:51.620]   Do you think power changed Putin?
[02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:54.260]   Do you think power changes leaders?
[02:27:54.260 --> 02:27:57.480]   If you look at the great leaders in history,
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:00.220]   whether it's LBJ, FDR,
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:02.940]   do you think power really changes people?
[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:06.120]   Like, is there a truth to that kind of old proverb?
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:08.400]   - It reveals, I think that's what it is.
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:09.420]   It reveals.
[02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:13.220]   So Putin was a much more deft politician,
[02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:15.240]   much more amenable to the West.
[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:18.460]   If you think back to 2001 and more, right?
[02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:20.040]   When he came, 'cause he was still,
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:21.900]   'cause at that time his biggest problem
[02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:24.200]   was intra-Russian politics, right?
[02:28:24.200 --> 02:28:27.460]   Like it was all consolidating power within the oligarchy.
[02:28:27.460 --> 02:28:31.100]   Once he did that by around like 2007,
[02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:34.720]   there's that famous time when he spoke out against the West
[02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:36.180]   at the Munich Security Conference.
[02:28:36.180 --> 02:28:37.540]   I forget when it was.
[02:28:37.540 --> 02:28:40.480]   And that's when everybody in the audience was like, whoa.
[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:42.860]   And he was talking about like NATO encirclement
[02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:45.700]   and like, we will not be beaten back by the West.
[02:28:45.700 --> 02:28:49.020]   Very shortly afterwards, like the Georgia invasion happens.
[02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:51.020]   And that was like a big wake-up call
[02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:53.340]   of like, we will not be pushed around anymore.
[02:28:53.340 --> 02:28:54.780]   I mean, he said before publicly,
[02:28:54.780 --> 02:28:57.380]   like the worst thing that ever happened was the fall.
[02:28:57.380 --> 02:28:58.220]   Or what did he say?
[02:28:58.220 --> 02:29:00.640]   He was like, the fall of the Soviet Union was a tragedy.
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:01.480]   Right? - Yeah.
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:02.740]   - Of course, people in the West were like, what?
[02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:04.180]   I'm like, I get it.
[02:29:04.180 --> 02:29:05.500]   Like they were a superpower.
[02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:08.500]   Now their population is declining.
[02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:09.620]   Like it's like a petro state.
[02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:10.460]   It sucks.
[02:29:10.460 --> 02:29:11.800]   Like, I understand.
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:15.640]   I understand like how somebody could feel about that.
[02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:17.520]   I think it revealed his character,
[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:23.440]   which is that he, I think he thinks of himself probably
[02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:27.820]   as he always has since 2001, as like this benevolent,
[02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:29.100]   almost as a benevolent dictator.
[02:29:29.100 --> 02:29:29.940]   He's like, without me,
[02:29:29.940 --> 02:29:31.340]   the whole system would collapse.
[02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:33.020]   I'm the only guy keeping these people in,
[02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:35.320]   I'm the only guy keeping all these people in check.
[02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:38.420]   Most Russians probably do support Putin
[02:29:38.420 --> 02:29:41.460]   because they feel like they support some form
[02:29:41.460 --> 02:29:43.500]   of functional government.
[02:29:43.500 --> 02:29:46.440]   And they view it as like a check against that,
[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:48.140]   which is a long, you know,
[02:29:48.140 --> 02:29:51.020]   has a long history within Russia too.
[02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:53.180]   So I don't know if it changed him.
[02:29:53.180 --> 02:29:55.100]   I think it just revealed him.
[02:29:55.100 --> 02:29:56.820]   Because it's not like he, I mean, he has a,
[02:29:56.820 --> 02:29:59.220]   you know, Navalny has put that like billion dollar palace
[02:29:59.220 --> 02:30:00.700]   and all that.
[02:30:00.700 --> 02:30:01.620]   I don't know.
[02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:03.820]   Sometimes I feel like Putin does that for show.
[02:30:03.820 --> 02:30:05.820]   He doesn't seem like somebody who indulges
[02:30:05.820 --> 02:30:06.780]   in all that stuff.
[02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:08.020]   Or maybe we just don't see it.
[02:30:08.020 --> 02:30:08.860]   Like, I don't know.
[02:30:08.860 --> 02:30:09.780]   - Well, I don't.
[02:30:09.780 --> 02:30:11.260]   It's very difficult for me to understand.
[02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:13.360]   I've been hanging out, thanks to Clubhouse,
[02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:18.700]   a lot of, I've gotten to learn a lot about the Navalny folks
[02:30:18.700 --> 02:30:20.420]   and it's been very educational.
[02:30:20.420 --> 02:30:24.780]   Made me ask a lot of important questions about what,
[02:30:24.780 --> 02:30:27.180]   question a lot of my assumptions
[02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:29.260]   about what I do and don't know.
[02:30:29.260 --> 02:30:34.260]   But I'll just say that I do believe, you know,
[02:30:34.260 --> 02:30:36.160]   there's a lot of the Navalny folks say
[02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:40.700]   that Putin is incompetent and is a bad executive,
[02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:44.380]   like is bad at basically running government.
[02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:46.380]   But to me-
[02:30:46.380 --> 02:30:48.500]   - Well, why do Russians not think that?
[02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:49.340]   Right?
[02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:50.180]   Well, they probably say propaganda.
[02:30:50.180 --> 02:30:51.100]   - They would say it's the press.
[02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:52.300]   Yeah, they would say the control.
[02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:56.780]   There is a strong either control or pressure on the press.
[02:30:56.780 --> 02:30:58.860]   But I think there is a legitimate support
[02:30:58.860 --> 02:31:02.260]   and love of Putin in Russia that is not grounded
[02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:05.140]   in just misinformation and propaganda.
[02:31:05.140 --> 02:31:07.420]   There's legitimacy there.
[02:31:07.420 --> 02:31:09.940]   Mostly, I try to remain apolitical
[02:31:09.940 --> 02:31:12.900]   and actually genuinely remain apolitical.
[02:31:12.900 --> 02:31:15.780]   I am legitimately not interested
[02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:18.940]   in the politics of Russia of today.
[02:31:18.940 --> 02:31:20.780]   I feel I have some responsibility
[02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:23.620]   and I'll take that responsibility on as I need to.
[02:31:23.620 --> 02:31:26.620]   But my fascination, as it is perhaps with you
[02:31:26.620 --> 02:31:30.660]   in part, is in the historical figure of Putin.
[02:31:30.660 --> 02:31:32.420]   I know he's currently president,
[02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:34.860]   but I'm almost looking like as if I was a kid
[02:31:34.860 --> 02:31:37.060]   in 30 years from now reading about him,
[02:31:37.060 --> 02:31:39.180]   studying the human being,
[02:31:39.180 --> 02:31:43.560]   the games of power that are played
[02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:47.140]   that got him to gain power, to maintain power,
[02:31:47.140 --> 02:31:51.140]   what that says about his human nature,
[02:31:51.140 --> 02:31:54.900]   the nature of the bureaucracy that's around him,
[02:31:54.900 --> 02:31:56.900]   the nature of Russia, the people,
[02:31:56.900 --> 02:31:58.380]   all those kinds of things,
[02:31:58.380 --> 02:32:00.700]   as opposed to the politics and the manipulation
[02:32:00.700 --> 02:32:03.660]   and the corruption and the control of the media
[02:32:03.660 --> 02:32:05.660]   that results in misinformation.
[02:32:05.660 --> 02:32:07.620]   You know, those are the bickering of the day,
[02:32:07.620 --> 02:32:08.660]   just like we were saying,
[02:32:08.660 --> 02:32:10.220]   what will actually be remembered
[02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:11.580]   about this moment in history?
[02:32:11.580 --> 02:32:12.400]   - Totally.
[02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:14.420]   He's a transformational figure in Russian history, really.
[02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:16.820]   Like the bridge between the fall of the Soviet Union
[02:32:16.820 --> 02:32:18.540]   and the chaos of Yeltsin.
[02:32:18.540 --> 02:32:21.060]   That will be how he's remembered.
[02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:22.700]   The only question is what comes next
[02:32:22.700 --> 02:32:24.420]   and what he wants to come next.
[02:32:24.420 --> 02:32:26.540]   That's, I'm always, I'm like, he's getting old.
[02:32:26.540 --> 02:32:27.380]   How old is he?
[02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:28.200]   60 something?
[02:32:28.200 --> 02:32:29.040]   - Yeah, 60.
[02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:31.780]   So he would be, I think he would be 80.
[02:32:31.780 --> 02:32:34.860]   So with the change of the constitution,
[02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:38.200]   he cannot be president until,
[02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:44.500]   six, four, 2034, I think it is.
[02:32:44.500 --> 02:32:46.700]   So he would be like 80 something
[02:32:46.700 --> 02:32:48.540]   and he would be in power for over 30 years,
[02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:50.700]   which is longer than Stalin.
[02:32:50.700 --> 02:32:54.380]   So, but he still, he still seems to be-
[02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:55.220]   - Seems fit.
[02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:57.940]   I think he's gonna be around for a long time.
[02:32:57.940 --> 02:32:59.700]   - But this is a fascinating question that you ask,
[02:32:59.700 --> 02:33:01.900]   which is like, what does he want?
[02:33:01.900 --> 02:33:02.740]   - I don't know.
[02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:03.580]   Yeah, that's the question.
[02:33:03.580 --> 02:33:06.060]   I don't, and this is where I think,
[02:33:06.060 --> 02:33:07.780]   given all of his behavior and more,
[02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:09.220]   I don't know if it's about money.
[02:33:09.220 --> 02:33:11.180]   I don't know if it's about enriching himself.
[02:33:11.180 --> 02:33:13.660]   Obviously he did to the tune of billions and billions
[02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:15.140]   and billions of dollars.
[02:33:15.140 --> 02:33:17.420]   But I think he probably,
[02:33:17.420 --> 02:33:20.340]   he's as close to like an actual Russian nationalist,
[02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:24.020]   like at the top, who really does believe in Russia
[02:33:24.020 --> 02:33:26.060]   as its rightful superpower.
[02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:28.140]   Everything he does seems to stem
[02:33:28.140 --> 02:33:31.260]   from that opposition to NATO, intro to Syria,
[02:33:31.260 --> 02:33:35.780]   like wanting to play a large role in affairs,
[02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:40.340]   deeply distrustful and yet coveting of the European powers.
[02:33:40.340 --> 02:33:43.340]   Like, I could describe every czar,
[02:33:43.340 --> 02:33:44.620]   you know, in those same language.
[02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:47.180]   Like every czar falls into the exact same category.
[02:33:47.180 --> 02:33:48.940]   - Yeah, and I mean, it makes me wonder,
[02:33:48.940 --> 02:33:51.420]   well, looking at some of the biggest leaders
[02:33:51.420 --> 02:33:53.900]   in human history, to ask the question of,
[02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:55.420]   what was the motivation?
[02:33:55.420 --> 02:33:58.140]   What was the motivation for even just the revolutionaries
[02:33:58.140 --> 02:34:00.300]   like Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin?
[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:02.060]   What was the motivation?
[02:34:02.060 --> 02:34:05.780]   Because it sure as hell seems like the motivation
[02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:10.780]   was at least in part driven by the idea,
[02:34:10.780 --> 02:34:15.620]   by ideas, not self-interest of like power.
[02:34:15.620 --> 02:34:18.060]   - For Lenin, it was, I think he was a true believer
[02:34:18.060 --> 02:34:19.860]   and an actual narcissist,
[02:34:19.860 --> 02:34:21.620]   who thought he was the only one who could do it.
[02:34:21.620 --> 02:34:23.700]   Stalin, I do think just wanted power.
[02:34:23.700 --> 02:34:25.220]   And realized, well, I don't know.
[02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:27.860]   Look, he wrote very passionately when he was young.
[02:34:27.860 --> 02:34:30.300]   - And he really believed in communism.
[02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:31.500]   - In the beginning he did.
[02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:34.500]   What I'm always fascinated is I'm like,
[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:36.980]   around 1920, what happened, right?
[02:34:36.980 --> 02:34:40.340]   Post revolution, you crushed the whites.
[02:34:40.340 --> 02:34:42.540]   Now it's all about consolidation.
[02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:44.860]   That's where the games really began.
[02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:47.460]   And I'm like, I don't think that was about communism.
[02:34:47.460 --> 02:34:49.460]   (both laughing)
[02:34:49.460 --> 02:34:53.260]   - Yeah, maybe it became a useful propaganda tool,
[02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:55.740]   but it still seemed like he believed in it,
[02:34:55.740 --> 02:34:58.300]   whether it was, of course, this is the question.
[02:34:58.300 --> 02:35:01.540]   I mean, this is the problem with conspiracy theories for me.
[02:35:01.540 --> 02:35:04.900]   And this is legitimate criticism towards me
[02:35:04.900 --> 02:35:06.740]   about conspiracy theories, which is,
[02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:09.860]   just because you're not like this
[02:35:09.860 --> 02:35:11.300]   doesn't mean others aren't like this.
[02:35:11.300 --> 02:35:16.300]   So like, I can't believe that somebody be deeply two-faced.
[02:35:16.300 --> 02:35:17.740]   - Oh, I've met them.
[02:35:17.740 --> 02:35:18.940]   You're welcome to Washington.
[02:35:18.940 --> 02:35:20.460]   (both laughing)
[02:35:20.460 --> 02:35:23.340]   - But like, I think that I would be able to detect.
[02:35:23.340 --> 02:35:25.820]   - I don't think so. - No.
[02:35:25.820 --> 02:35:27.380]   - These people are good.
[02:35:27.380 --> 02:35:29.660]   - Well, my question is-- - I've seen it.
[02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:30.860]   - Well, so there's difference.
[02:35:30.860 --> 02:35:32.300]   There's two-faced, like,
[02:35:32.300 --> 02:35:35.940]   there's different levels of two-faced.
[02:35:35.940 --> 02:35:39.380]   What I mean is to be killing people,
[02:35:39.380 --> 02:35:43.340]   and it's like "House of Cards" style, right?
[02:35:43.340 --> 02:35:48.340]   And still present a front like you're not killing people.
[02:35:49.060 --> 02:35:52.100]   I don't know if, I guess it's possible,
[02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:54.940]   but I just don't see that scale.
[02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:56.620]   Like, there's a lot of people like that,
[02:35:56.620 --> 02:35:58.980]   and I don't, I have trouble imagining
[02:35:58.980 --> 02:36:04.260]   some, you know, that's such a compelling narrative
[02:36:04.260 --> 02:36:06.180]   that people like to say.
[02:36:06.180 --> 02:36:09.820]   Like, people, that's the conspiratorial mindset.
[02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:11.700]   I think that skepticism is really powerful
[02:36:11.700 --> 02:36:14.020]   and important to have because it's true.
[02:36:14.020 --> 02:36:15.920]   A lot of powerful people abuse their power,
[02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:18.000]   but saying that about,
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:21.900]   I feel like people over-assume that.
[02:36:21.900 --> 02:36:24.260]   It's like, I see that with use of steroids,
[02:36:24.260 --> 02:36:25.580]   often in sports.
[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:28.040]   People seem to make that claim
[02:36:28.040 --> 02:36:30.700]   about, like, everybody who's successful.
[02:36:30.700 --> 02:36:32.360]   And I wanna be very, I don't know,
[02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:33.980]   something about me wants to be cautious
[02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:37.900]   'cause I wanna give people a chance.
[02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:39.500]   - Being purely cynical isn't helpful.
[02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:40.340]   People say this about me.
[02:36:40.340 --> 02:36:42.100]   "He's only saying this to do this."
[02:36:42.100 --> 02:36:43.340]   - Yeah, but at the same time,
[02:36:43.340 --> 02:36:45.180]   being naively optimistic about everything
[02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:46.780]   is also kind of pedophilic
[02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:49.140]   'cause people are gonna fuck you over.
[02:36:49.140 --> 02:36:51.980]   And more importantly, that doesn't bother me.
[02:36:51.980 --> 02:36:53.680]   More importantly, you're not gonna be able to reason
[02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:56.260]   about how to create systems that are going to be robust
[02:36:56.260 --> 02:37:01.260]   to corruption, to malevolent, like, parties.
[02:37:01.260 --> 02:37:04.220]   So in order to create,
[02:37:04.220 --> 02:37:07.500]   you have to have a healthy balance of both, I suppose,
[02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:09.580]   especially if you wanna actually engineer things
[02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:13.180]   that work in this world that has evil in it.
[02:37:13.180 --> 02:37:15.780]   I can't believe there's a book of Hitler on the desk.
[02:37:15.780 --> 02:37:17.340]   (Lex laughing)
[02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:18.660]   - We've mentioned a lot of books
[02:37:18.660 --> 02:37:20.460]   throughout this conversation.
[02:37:20.460 --> 02:37:23.380]   I wonder, and this makes me really curious
[02:37:23.380 --> 02:37:27.460]   to explore in a lot of depth
[02:37:27.460 --> 02:37:30.300]   the kind of books that you're interested in.
[02:37:30.300 --> 02:37:31.940]   I think you mentioned in your show
[02:37:31.940 --> 02:37:35.780]   that you provide recommendations.
[02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:37.220]   - Yes, I do.
[02:37:37.220 --> 02:37:39.440]   - In the form of spoken word,
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:42.220]   can you beyond what we've already recommended,
[02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:47.220]   mention books, whether it is historical, nonfiction,
[02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:50.460]   or whether it's more like philosophical or even fiction
[02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:52.540]   that had a big impact on your life?
[02:37:52.540 --> 02:37:53.820]   Is there a few that you can mention?
[02:37:53.820 --> 02:37:55.740]   - Sure, I already talked about the Johnson books,
[02:37:55.740 --> 02:37:56.820]   so I'll leave that alone.
[02:37:56.820 --> 02:37:59.540]   Robert A. Caro, he's still alive, thank God.
[02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:01.540]   He's finishing the last book.
[02:38:01.540 --> 02:38:03.000]   I hope he makes it.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.380]   So those Johnson books.
[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:06.340]   Second--
[02:38:06.340 --> 02:38:07.780]   - Can I ask you a question about those books?
[02:38:07.780 --> 02:38:08.620]   - Yes.
[02:38:08.620 --> 02:38:11.020]   - What the hell do you fit into so many pages?
[02:38:11.020 --> 02:38:11.860]   - Everything, man.
[02:38:11.860 --> 02:38:12.940]   (laughing)
[02:38:12.940 --> 02:38:13.780]   Let me tell you this.
[02:38:13.780 --> 02:38:14.900]   So I'll just give an anecdote.
[02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:16.540]   This is why I love these books.
[02:38:16.540 --> 02:38:19.540]   The beginning, the first book is about Lyndon Johnson.
[02:38:19.540 --> 02:38:22.820]   His life to when he gets elected to Congress.
[02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:26.300]   The book begins with a history of Texas
[02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:27.760]   and its weather patterns,
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:32.740]   and then of his great, great grandfather moving to Texas.
[02:38:32.740 --> 02:38:34.500]   Then the story of that,
[02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:37.260]   about 100 or so pages in, you get to Lyndon Johnson.
[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:38.260]   (laughing)
[02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:39.980]   That's how you do it.
[02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:42.900]   - Okay, so it's like a Tolstoy-style retelling.
[02:38:42.900 --> 02:38:43.720]   - This is the thing.
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:45.860]   It's not a biography, it's a story of the times.
[02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:47.460]   That's a great biography.
[02:38:47.460 --> 02:38:50.380]   So another one, this isn't part of my list, so don't.
[02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:52.020]   (laughing)
[02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:53.540]   Is Grant-- - All right, off the record.
[02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:54.820]   - Ron Chernow.
[02:38:54.820 --> 02:38:56.060]   Ron Chernow's Grant.
[02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:57.500]   It's 1,000 pages.
[02:38:57.500 --> 02:38:59.060]   And the reason I tell everybody to read it
[02:38:59.060 --> 02:39:01.540]   is it's not just the story of Grant,
[02:39:01.540 --> 02:39:04.380]   it is the story of pre-Civil War America,
[02:39:04.380 --> 02:39:07.460]   the Mexican-American War, the Civil War,
[02:39:07.460 --> 02:39:10.840]   and Reconstruction all told in the life of one person
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:12.540]   who was involved in all three.
[02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:13.380]   Most people don't know anything
[02:39:13.380 --> 02:39:14.460]   about the Mexican-American War.
[02:39:14.460 --> 02:39:15.820]   It's fascinating.
[02:39:15.820 --> 02:39:18.120]   Most people don't know anything about Reconstruction.
[02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:21.120]   Now more so, because people are talking, it's a hot topic now.
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:22.820]   I've been reading about it for years.
[02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:26.260]   That is another thing people need to learn a lot more about.
[02:39:26.260 --> 02:39:28.760]   In terms of non-history books,
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:31.820]   the book that probably had the most impact on me,
[02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:34.860]   which is also historical nonfiction,
[02:39:34.860 --> 02:39:39.860]   is I am obsessed with Antarctic exploration.
[02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:43.420]   And it all began with a book
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:45.900]   called "Shackleton's Incredible Journey,"
[02:39:45.900 --> 02:39:48.740]   which is the collection of diaries
[02:39:48.740 --> 02:39:51.180]   of everybody who was on Shackleton's journey.
[02:39:51.180 --> 02:39:52.900]   For those who don't know,
[02:39:52.900 --> 02:39:56.740]   Shackleton was the last explorer
[02:39:56.740 --> 02:39:59.780]   of the heroic age of Antarctic exploration.
[02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:03.060]   He led a ship called the Endurance,
[02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:08.060]   which froze in the ice off the coast of Antarctica in 1914.
[02:40:08.060 --> 02:40:13.740]   And they didn't have radios over the last exploration,
[02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:16.100]   the last one without the age of radio.
[02:40:16.100 --> 02:40:18.580]   And he happens to freeze in the ice.
[02:40:18.580 --> 02:40:21.980]   And then the ship collapses after a year,
[02:40:21.980 --> 02:40:23.180]   frozen in the ice.
[02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:28.180]   And this man leads his entire crew from that ship
[02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:31.140]   onto the ice with a team of dogs,
[02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:34.460]   survives out on the ice for another year
[02:40:34.460 --> 02:40:36.380]   with three little lifeboats,
[02:40:36.380 --> 02:40:38.820]   and is able to get all of his men,
[02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:40.720]   every single one of them alive,
[02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:44.920]   to an island hundreds of miles away called Elephant Island.
[02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:46.340]   And when they got there,
[02:40:46.340 --> 02:40:50.420]   he had to leave everybody behind except for six people.
[02:40:50.420 --> 02:40:54.680]   And him and two other guys, I'm forgetting their names,
[02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:59.680]   navigated by the stars 800 miles through the Drake Passage
[02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:03.580]   with seas of hundreds of feet to Prince,
[02:41:03.580 --> 02:41:05.700]   I think it's called Prince George's Island.
[02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:08.580]   And then when they got to Prince George's Island,
[02:41:08.580 --> 02:41:10.380]   they landed on the wrong side
[02:41:10.380 --> 02:41:14.100]   and they had to hike from one side to the other
[02:41:14.100 --> 02:41:15.700]   to go and meet the whalers.
[02:41:15.700 --> 02:41:17.540]   And every single one of those things
[02:41:17.540 --> 02:41:18.940]   was supposed to be impossible.
[02:41:18.940 --> 02:41:21.820]   Nobody was ever supposed to hike that island.
[02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:24.260]   It wasn't done again until like the 1980s
[02:41:24.260 --> 02:41:25.860]   with professional equipment.
[02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:28.220]   He did it after two years of starvation.
[02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:30.740]   Nobody was ever supposed to make it
[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:33.460]   from Elephant Island to Prince George.
[02:41:33.460 --> 02:41:36.440]   The guy, they had to hold him steady, his legs,
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:38.380]   so that he could chart the stars.
[02:41:38.380 --> 02:41:40.040]   And if they miss this island,
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:42.780]   they're into open sea, they're dead.
[02:41:42.780 --> 02:41:44.220]   And then before that,
[02:41:44.220 --> 02:41:46.380]   how do you survive for a year on the ice?
[02:41:46.380 --> 02:41:47.580]   On seals.
[02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:51.700]   And before that, he kept his crew from depression,
[02:41:51.700 --> 02:41:53.700]   frozen one year in the ice.
[02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:55.660]   It's just an amazing story.
[02:41:55.660 --> 02:41:58.460]   And it made me obsessed with Antarctic exploration.
[02:41:58.460 --> 02:42:00.020]   So I've read like 15 books on.
[02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:02.700]   - What the hell is it about the human spirit?
[02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:03.780]   - That's the thing about Antarctica
[02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:05.260]   is it brings it out of you.
[02:42:05.260 --> 02:42:06.580]   So for example, I read another one
[02:42:06.580 --> 02:42:08.940]   recently called "Mawson's Will."
[02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:10.780]   Douglas Mawson, he was an Australian.
[02:42:10.780 --> 02:42:15.140]   He was on one of the first Robert Frost expeditions.
[02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:17.420]   He leads an expedition down to the South.
[02:42:17.420 --> 02:42:21.700]   Him and a partner, they're leading explorations,
[02:42:21.700 --> 02:42:23.460]   1908, something like that.
[02:42:23.460 --> 02:42:27.500]   They're going around Antarctica with dog teams.
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:31.060]   And one of the, what happens is they keep going over
[02:42:31.060 --> 02:42:33.220]   these snow bridges where there's a crevice,
[02:42:33.220 --> 02:42:34.660]   but it's covered in snow.
[02:42:34.660 --> 02:42:38.460]   And so one of the lead driver,
[02:42:38.460 --> 02:42:40.980]   the dogs go over and they plummet.
[02:42:40.980 --> 02:42:43.300]   And that sled takes with it.
[02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:47.460]   So the guy survives, but that sled takes all their food,
[02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:52.460]   half the dogs, their stove, the camping tent,
[02:42:52.900 --> 02:42:56.180]   the tent specifically designed for the snow, everything.
[02:42:56.180 --> 02:42:59.860]   And they're hundreds of miles away from base camp.
[02:42:59.860 --> 02:43:02.740]   He and this guy have to make it back there
[02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:05.780]   in time before the ship comes to come get them
[02:43:05.780 --> 02:43:07.740]   on an agreed upon date.
[02:43:07.740 --> 02:43:11.180]   And he makes it, but the guy he was with, he dies.
[02:43:11.180 --> 02:43:12.020]   And it's a crazy story.
[02:43:12.020 --> 02:43:14.300]   First of all, they have to eat the dogs.
[02:43:14.300 --> 02:43:16.380]   A really creepy part of Antarctic exploration
[02:43:16.380 --> 02:43:19.180]   is everyone ends up eating dogs at different points.
[02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:22.940]   And part of the theory, which is so crazy,
[02:43:22.940 --> 02:43:25.980]   is that the guy he was with was dying
[02:43:25.980 --> 02:43:28.980]   because they were eating dog liver.
[02:43:28.980 --> 02:43:31.300]   And dog liver has a lot of vitamin E,
[02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:32.980]   which if you eat too much of it
[02:43:32.980 --> 02:43:34.740]   can give you like a poisoning.
[02:43:34.740 --> 02:43:38.180]   And so Mawson, by trying to help his friend,
[02:43:38.180 --> 02:43:39.300]   was giving him more liver.
[02:43:39.300 --> 02:43:40.900]   - Of all the things that kills you.
[02:43:40.900 --> 02:43:42.500]   - I know, it's dog liver.
[02:43:42.500 --> 02:43:44.340]   And so his friend ends up dying,
[02:43:44.340 --> 02:43:46.340]   have a horrific heart attack, all of that.
[02:43:46.340 --> 02:43:49.700]   Mawson crawls back hundreds of miles away,
[02:43:49.700 --> 02:43:54.180]   makes it back to base camp hours after the ship leaves.
[02:43:54.180 --> 02:43:57.940]   And two guys or a couple of guys stayed behind for him.
[02:43:57.940 --> 02:43:59.420]   And he basically has to recuperate
[02:43:59.420 --> 02:44:02.620]   for like six months before he can even walk again.
[02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:04.180]   But it's like you were saying about the human spirit.
[02:44:04.180 --> 02:44:07.500]   It's like Antarctica brings that out of people.
[02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:10.500]   Or Amundsen, the guy who made it to the South Pole,
[02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:12.780]   Robert Amundsen, oh my God.
[02:44:12.780 --> 02:44:16.780]   Like this guy trained his whole life in the ice
[02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:20.140]   from Norway to make it to the South Pole.
[02:44:20.140 --> 02:44:21.660]   And he beat Robert Frost,
[02:44:21.660 --> 02:44:24.700]   the British guy with all this money and all these.
[02:44:24.700 --> 02:44:26.060]   I could go on this forever.
[02:44:26.060 --> 02:44:27.340]   I'm obsessed with it.
[02:44:27.340 --> 02:44:30.180]   - Well, first of all, I'm gonna take this part
[02:44:30.180 --> 02:44:33.020]   of the podcast, I'm gonna set it to music,
[02:44:33.020 --> 02:44:33.860]   I'm gonna listen to it,
[02:44:33.860 --> 02:44:35.620]   'cause I've been whining and bitching
[02:44:35.620 --> 02:44:39.260]   about running 48 miles with Goggins this next weekend.
[02:44:39.260 --> 02:44:41.420]   And this is gonna be so easy.
[02:44:41.420 --> 02:44:43.660]   I'm just gonna listen to this over and over in my head.
[02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:44.500]   You're gonna be cool.
[02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:45.820]   - Elon's obsessed with Shackleton.
[02:44:45.820 --> 02:44:46.660]   He talks about him all the time.
[02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:48.860]   - He uses, I was gonna ask him about that.
[02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:51.100]   He uses an example of,
[02:44:51.100 --> 02:44:56.940]   that as an example of what Mars colonization would be like.
[02:44:56.940 --> 02:44:58.540]   - He's right.
[02:44:58.540 --> 02:45:02.220]   No, Antarctica is as close to, you can simulate that.
[02:45:02.220 --> 02:45:05.580]   Antarctica's as close to what you could simulate
[02:45:05.580 --> 02:45:06.420]   what it would get.
[02:45:06.420 --> 02:45:08.960]   That Nat Geo series on Mars,
[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:10.780]   I'm not sure if you watched it, it's incredible.
[02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:11.980]   Elon's actually in it.
[02:45:11.980 --> 02:45:15.820]   And it's like, they get there, everything goes wrong,
[02:45:15.820 --> 02:45:20.540]   somebody dies, it's horrible, they can't find any water,
[02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:21.780]   it's not working.
[02:45:21.780 --> 02:45:22.620]   - So what is it?
[02:45:22.620 --> 02:45:23.980]   Is it simulating the experience
[02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:25.220]   of what it'd be like to colonize?
[02:45:25.220 --> 02:45:28.940]   - So it's like a docu-series where the fictionalized part
[02:45:28.940 --> 02:45:32.100]   is the astronauts on Mars,
[02:45:32.100 --> 02:45:34.580]   but then they're interviewing people like Elon Musk
[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:37.340]   and others who are the ones who paved the way
[02:45:37.340 --> 02:45:38.780]   to get to Mars.
[02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:40.380]   So it's a really interesting concept.
[02:45:40.380 --> 02:45:41.900]   I think it's on Netflix.
[02:45:41.900 --> 02:45:44.220]   And yeah, I agree with him 100%,
[02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:46.300]   which is that the first guys to make,
[02:45:46.300 --> 02:45:50.140]   like for example, Robert Frost, who went to Australia,
[02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:54.220]   sorry, to Antarctica, the British explorer
[02:45:54.220 --> 02:45:56.220]   who was beaten to the South Pole three weeks
[02:45:56.220 --> 02:45:59.260]   by Robert Amundsen, he died on the way back.
[02:45:59.260 --> 02:46:01.460]   And the reason why is 'cause he wasn't well-prepared,
[02:46:01.460 --> 02:46:05.260]   he was arrogant, he didn't have the proper amounts
[02:46:05.260 --> 02:46:08.460]   of supplies, his team had terrible morale.
[02:46:08.460 --> 02:46:09.940]   Antarctica was a brutal place.
[02:46:09.940 --> 02:46:12.260]   If you fuck up one time, you die.
[02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:14.780]   And it's like, and this is what you read a lot about,
[02:46:14.780 --> 02:46:17.220]   which is the reason why such heroic characters
[02:46:17.220 --> 02:46:20.820]   like Shackleton Shine is a lot of people died.
[02:46:20.820 --> 02:46:23.660]   Like there were some people who got frozen in the ice.
[02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:28.020]   I mean, man, this again also came to the North exploration.
[02:46:28.020 --> 02:46:29.700]   So I read a lot about like the exploration
[02:46:29.700 --> 02:46:31.060]   of the North Pole.
[02:46:31.060 --> 02:46:35.900]   And same thing, these unextraordinary men take people
[02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:38.780]   out into the ice and get frozen out there for years
[02:46:38.780 --> 02:46:40.660]   and shit goes so bad.
[02:46:40.660 --> 02:46:43.700]   They end up eating each other, they all die.
[02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:45.740]   There's a famous, I'm forgetting his name,
[02:46:45.740 --> 02:46:47.580]   the British Franklin Expedition,
[02:46:47.580 --> 02:46:50.860]   where they went searching for them for like 20 years.
[02:46:50.860 --> 02:46:52.900]   And they eventually came across a group of Inuit
[02:46:52.900 --> 02:46:55.340]   who were like, oh yeah, we saw some weird white men here
[02:46:55.340 --> 02:46:56.860]   like 15 years ago.
[02:46:56.860 --> 02:46:59.020]   And they find their bones and there's like saw marks
[02:46:59.020 --> 02:47:01.020]   which show that they were eating each other.
[02:47:01.020 --> 02:47:03.700]   - So history remembers the ones who didn't eat each other.
[02:47:03.700 --> 02:47:06.820]   - Yeah, well, yeah, we remember the ones who made it,
[02:47:06.820 --> 02:47:08.220]   but there are--
[02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:11.100]   - And that would be the story of Mars as well.
[02:47:11.100 --> 02:47:12.300]   - That will be the story of Mars.
[02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:14.500]   - But, and nevertheless, that's the interesting thing
[02:47:14.500 --> 02:47:19.500]   about Antarctica, nevertheless, something about human nature
[02:47:19.500 --> 02:47:22.100]   drives us to explore it.
[02:47:22.100 --> 02:47:25.300]   And that seems to be like, a lot of people have this kind
[02:47:25.300 --> 02:47:28.460]   of, to me, frustrating conversations like,
[02:47:28.460 --> 02:47:31.520]   well, Earth is great, man.
[02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:33.140]   Why do we need to colonize Mars?
[02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:34.660]   - You just don't get it.
[02:47:34.660 --> 02:47:36.220]   - I don't know, I mean, I don't know.
[02:47:36.220 --> 02:47:39.220]   It's the same people that say like, why are you running?
[02:47:39.220 --> 02:47:41.620]   Like, why are you running a marathon?
[02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:43.980]   What are you running from, man?
[02:47:43.980 --> 02:47:48.580]   I don't know, it's pushing the limits of the human mind,
[02:47:48.580 --> 02:47:51.300]   of what's possible.
[02:47:51.300 --> 02:47:54.180]   - It's George Mallory because it's there.
[02:47:54.180 --> 02:47:55.980]   - Yeah. - It's simple.
[02:47:55.980 --> 02:47:58.380]   - And that somehow actually, the result of that,
[02:47:58.380 --> 02:48:01.900]   if you wanna be pragmatic about it,
[02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:04.240]   there's something about pushing that limit
[02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:06.420]   that has side effects that you don't expect
[02:48:06.420 --> 02:48:08.780]   that will create a better world back home
[02:48:08.780 --> 02:48:11.020]   for the people, not necessarily on Earth,
[02:48:11.020 --> 02:48:15.300]   but just in general, it raises the quality of life
[02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:18.220]   for everybody, even though the initial endeavor
[02:48:18.220 --> 02:48:19.900]   doesn't make any sense.
[02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:24.820]   The very fact of pushing the limits of what's possible
[02:48:24.820 --> 02:48:28.740]   then has side effects of benefiting everybody.
[02:48:28.740 --> 02:48:32.100]   And it's difficult to predict ahead of time
[02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:33.540]   what those benefits will be.
[02:48:33.540 --> 02:48:36.780]   Say with colonizing Mars, it's unclear what the benefits
[02:48:36.780 --> 02:48:38.620]   will be for Earth or in general.
[02:48:38.620 --> 02:48:41.260]   - Well, what did we get from the moon?
[02:48:41.260 --> 02:48:43.500]   What did we get from Apollo, right?
[02:48:43.500 --> 02:48:45.500]   Technically, and there were a lot of socialists
[02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:46.660]   at the time making this argument.
[02:48:46.660 --> 02:48:48.780]   They're like, "All this money going."
[02:48:48.780 --> 02:48:49.600]   You know what?
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:52.820]   We went to the fucking moon in 1969.
[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:53.940]   That was amazing.
[02:48:53.940 --> 02:48:58.020]   The greatest feat in human history, period.
[02:48:58.020 --> 02:48:59.340]   What did we learn from it?
[02:48:59.340 --> 02:49:04.100]   We learned about interstellar or interplanetary travel.
[02:49:04.100 --> 02:49:06.580]   We learned that we could do something
[02:49:06.580 --> 02:49:09.800]   off of a device less powerful than the computer
[02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:10.900]   in my pocket.
[02:49:10.900 --> 02:49:15.540]   Like the amount of potential locked within my pocket
[02:49:15.540 --> 02:49:16.940]   and your pocket.
[02:49:16.940 --> 02:49:19.420]   I mean, if you were to define my politics in one way,
[02:49:19.420 --> 02:49:23.600]   it's greatness, like a quest for national greatness.
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:26.500]   There is no greatness without fulfilling
[02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:30.260]   the ultimate calling of the human spirit, which is more.
[02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:32.540]   It's not enough, and why should it be?
[02:49:32.540 --> 02:49:34.540]   It wasn't enough.
[02:49:34.540 --> 02:49:38.380]   Our ancestors could have been content to sit,
[02:49:38.380 --> 02:49:41.240]   well, actually, many of them were content to sit
[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:43.460]   and say, "These berries will be here for a long time."
[02:49:43.460 --> 02:49:44.980]   And they got eaten and they died.
[02:49:44.980 --> 02:49:48.700]   And it's the ones who got out and went to the next place
[02:49:48.700 --> 02:49:51.780]   and the next place and went across the Siberian land bridge
[02:49:51.780 --> 02:49:55.460]   and went across more and just did extraordinary things.
[02:49:55.460 --> 02:49:58.220]   The craziest ones, we are their offspring
[02:49:58.220 --> 02:50:01.440]   and we fail them if we don't go into space.
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:02.740]   That's how I would put it.
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:05.100]   - You should run for president.
[02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:06.300]   (laughing)
[02:50:06.300 --> 02:50:07.540]   - I'm just pro space, man.
[02:50:07.540 --> 02:50:08.580]   I love space.
[02:50:08.580 --> 02:50:10.780]   - No, you're pro doing difficult things
[02:50:10.780 --> 02:50:14.860]   and pushing, exploring the world in all of its forms.
[02:50:14.860 --> 02:50:18.800]   I hope that kind of spirit permeates politics too.
[02:50:18.800 --> 02:50:20.420]   That same kind of-
[02:50:20.420 --> 02:50:22.040]   - Can, can.
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:24.780]   - Well, it can, and I hope so.
[02:50:24.780 --> 02:50:25.980]   I don't know if you want to stay on it,
[02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:28.140]   but I think that was book number one or two.
[02:50:28.140 --> 02:50:28.980]   - Oh, shit, yeah.
[02:50:28.980 --> 02:50:30.620]   Okay, all right, all right.
[02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:31.460]   - Is there something-
[02:50:31.460 --> 02:50:32.280]   - Well, this one is a second,
[02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:34.280]   actually is a corollary to that, which is "Sapiens."
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:37.640]   And I know that's a very normal, normie answer.
[02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:38.600]   One of the best-selling book.
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:39.960]   I think there's a reason for that.
[02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:41.600]   "Yuval Noah Harari."
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:42.440]   Oh, cool.
[02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:44.660]   Okay, look, yes, he didn't do any new research.
[02:50:44.660 --> 02:50:45.500]   I get that.
[02:50:45.500 --> 02:50:46.540]   All he did was aggregate.
[02:50:46.540 --> 02:50:49.060]   I'm sure he's very controversial in the scientific community,
[02:50:49.060 --> 02:50:49.900]   but guess what?
[02:50:49.900 --> 02:50:50.720]   He wrote a great book.
[02:50:50.720 --> 02:50:55.720]   It's a very easy to read general explanation
[02:50:55.720 --> 02:50:58.160]   of the rise of human history.
[02:50:58.160 --> 02:51:00.600]   And it helps challenge a lot of preconceptions.
[02:51:00.600 --> 02:51:01.600]   Are we special?
[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:02.640]   Are we an accident?
[02:51:02.640 --> 02:51:04.200]   Are we more like a parasite?
[02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:05.160]   Are we not?
[02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:08.000]   What, is there a destiny to all of us?
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:09.240]   I don't know.
[02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:11.000]   If anything, it's like what I just described,
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:12.000]   which is more.
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.140]   Move, move out.
[02:51:14.140 --> 02:51:15.520]   The evolution of money.
[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:17.780]   Like, I know he gets a lot of hate,
[02:51:17.780 --> 02:51:21.220]   but I think that he writes it so clearly and well
[02:51:21.220 --> 02:51:23.560]   that for your average person to be able to read that,
[02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:26.200]   you will come away with a more clear understanding
[02:51:26.200 --> 02:51:28.880]   of the human race than before.
[02:51:28.880 --> 02:51:30.720]   And I think that that's why it's worth it.
[02:51:30.720 --> 02:51:32.840]   I agree with you 100%.
[02:51:32.840 --> 02:51:35.560]   I'm ashamed to, I usually don't bring up "Sapiens"
[02:51:35.560 --> 02:51:36.520]   because it's like-
[02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:38.760]   - Yeah, it's like everybody's uncle has read it,
[02:51:38.760 --> 02:51:41.040]   but that's a good thing, actually.
[02:51:41.040 --> 02:51:43.320]   - It is one of the, I think it'll be remembered
[02:51:43.320 --> 02:51:46.440]   as one of the great books of this particular era.
[02:51:46.440 --> 02:51:48.480]   Yeah, because it's so clearly,
[02:51:48.480 --> 02:51:50.760]   it's like the selfish gene with Dawkins.
[02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:53.440]   I mean, it just aggregates so many ideas together
[02:51:53.440 --> 02:51:54.800]   and puts language to it
[02:51:54.800 --> 02:51:57.260]   that makes it very useful to talk about.
[02:51:57.260 --> 02:51:59.320]   So it is one of the great books.
[02:51:59.320 --> 02:52:00.880]   - 100%.
[02:52:00.880 --> 02:52:03.460]   Another one is definitely "Born to Run"
[02:52:03.460 --> 02:52:05.940]   for the same reason by Christopher McDougall,
[02:52:05.940 --> 02:52:06.780]   which is that-
[02:52:06.780 --> 02:52:09.040]   - I'm just gonna listen to this whole podcast next week.
[02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:09.880]   - You have to.
[02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:14.880]   You should, because you are inheriting our most basic skill,
[02:52:14.880 --> 02:52:19.120]   which is running and re-imagining human history
[02:52:19.120 --> 02:52:24.120]   or re-imagining what we were as opposed to what we are
[02:52:24.120 --> 02:52:27.740]   is very useful because it helps you understand
[02:52:27.740 --> 02:52:31.040]   how to tap into primal aspects of your brain,
[02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:32.700]   which just drive you.
[02:52:32.700 --> 02:52:34.920]   And the reason I love McDougall's writing
[02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:37.160]   is because I love anybody who writes like this,
[02:52:37.160 --> 02:52:39.640]   Malcolm Gladwell, who else?
[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:42.600]   Michael Lewis, people who find characters
[02:52:42.600 --> 02:52:43.680]   to tell a bigger story.
[02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:45.360]   Michael Lewis finds characters
[02:52:45.360 --> 02:52:48.120]   to tell us the story of the financial crisis.
[02:52:48.120 --> 02:52:49.640]   You know, Malcolm Gladwell writes,
[02:52:49.640 --> 02:52:51.160]   finds characters to tell us the story
[02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:53.080]   of learning new skills and outliers
[02:52:53.080 --> 02:52:56.640]   and whatever his latest book is, I forget what it's called.
[02:52:56.640 --> 02:53:00.160]   And, but McDougall tells the vignettes
[02:53:00.160 --> 02:53:02.560]   and a tiny story of a single person
[02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:04.700]   in the history of running
[02:53:04.700 --> 02:53:07.760]   and like how it's baked into your DNA.
[02:53:07.760 --> 02:53:10.560]   And I think there was just something very useful
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:11.760]   to that for me for being like,
[02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:13.640]   I don't need to go to the gym or like,
[02:53:13.640 --> 02:53:15.420]   I'm not saying you should still go to the gym.
[02:53:15.420 --> 02:53:16.260]   I'll be clear.
[02:53:16.260 --> 02:53:19.840]   I'm saying like, in order to fulfill like who you are,
[02:53:19.840 --> 02:53:23.680]   you can actually tap into something that's the most basic.
[02:53:23.680 --> 02:53:24.920]   I don't know if, I'm sure you've listened
[02:53:24.920 --> 02:53:27.160]   to the David Cho episode with Joe Rogan.
[02:53:27.160 --> 02:53:29.160]   - Can you remind me?
[02:53:29.160 --> 02:53:30.400]   Oh, where he's the animal?
[02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:32.000]   - Yeah, right, with the baboon.
[02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:32.840]   When he goes hunting.
[02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:33.960]   And there's something to that, man.
[02:53:33.960 --> 02:53:34.800]   There's something to that,
[02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:36.040]   where it's just like,
[02:53:36.040 --> 02:53:39.560]   they are living the way that we were supposed to.
[02:53:39.560 --> 02:53:40.600]   We're not supposed, well,
[02:53:40.600 --> 02:53:42.240]   I don't wanna put a normative judgment on it.
[02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:45.280]   They're living the way that we used to.
[02:53:45.280 --> 02:53:46.520]   There's something very- - It feels more honest
[02:53:46.520 --> 02:53:48.800]   somehow to our true nature.
[02:53:48.800 --> 02:53:50.480]   - There's a guy I follow on Instagram.
[02:53:50.480 --> 02:53:53.840]   I've come from, Paul Saladino, carnivore MD.
[02:53:53.840 --> 02:53:57.320]   He just went over there to the Hadza to live with them.
[02:53:57.320 --> 02:53:59.480]   And I was watching his stuff, just like,
[02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:03.560]   I was like, man, there's something in you that wants to go.
[02:54:03.560 --> 02:54:05.160]   I'm like, I wanna do that.
[02:54:05.160 --> 02:54:07.560]   I wouldn't be very good at it, but like, I want to.
[02:54:07.560 --> 02:54:09.280]   - I'm so glad that somebody
[02:54:09.280 --> 02:54:11.040]   that thinks deeply about politics
[02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:13.000]   is so fascinated with exploration
[02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:17.840]   and with the very basic nature,
[02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:20.240]   like human nature, nature of our existence.
[02:54:20.240 --> 02:54:21.600]   I love that.
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:23.160]   There's something in you.
[02:54:23.160 --> 02:54:25.160]   - And still you're stuck in DC.
[02:54:25.160 --> 02:54:26.760]   - For now, for now.
[02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:31.480]   - Speaking of which, you are from Texas.
[02:54:31.480 --> 02:54:32.640]   - Yes.
[02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:35.960]   - What do you make of the future of Texas politically,
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:39.640]   culturally, economically?
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:43.600]   I am in part moving, well, I'm moving to Austin.
[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:44.440]   - Congrats.
[02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:46.920]   - But I'm also doing the Eric Weinstein advice,
[02:54:46.920 --> 02:54:49.440]   which is like, dude, you're not married,
[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:51.080]   you don't have kids. - Blood everywhere.
[02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:52.960]   - There's no such thing as moving.
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:54.600]   What are you moving?
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:58.440]   You're like, you're three suits
[02:54:58.440 --> 02:54:59.960]   and some shirts and underwear.
[02:54:59.960 --> 02:55:02.720]   What exactly is the move entail?
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:03.640]   So I have nothing.
[02:55:03.640 --> 02:55:08.000]   So I'm basically, it's very just remain mobile,
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:12.600]   but there's a promise, there's a hope to Austin.
[02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:17.280]   Outside of, I mean, my, outside of just like friendships,
[02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:19.000]   I have no, it's a very different culture
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:20.200]   that Joe Rogan is creating.
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:22.640]   I'm mostly interested in the,
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:24.520]   what the next Silicon Valley will be,
[02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:28.480]   what the next hub of technological innovation,
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:32.040]   and there's a promise, maybe a dream,
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:34.440]   for Austin being that next place.
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:35.400]   - It's very possible.
[02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:40.400]   - Doesn't have the baggage of some of the political things,
[02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:45.600]   maybe some of the sort of things that hold back
[02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:49.720]   the beauty of, that makes capitalism,
[02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:51.760]   that makes innovation so powerful,
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:55.520]   which is like a meritocracy, which is excellence.
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:57.400]   Diversity is exceptionally important,
[02:55:57.400 --> 02:56:01.680]   but not, it should not be the only priority.
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:05.840]   It has to be something that coexists
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:10.280]   with a insatiable drive towards excellence.
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:13.560]   And it seems like Texas is a nice place.
[02:56:13.560 --> 02:56:18.560]   Like having Austin, which is like a kind of this weird,
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:20.520]   I hope it stays weird, man.
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:21.360]   I love weird people.
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:24.360]   - I don't know about that, but we can get into it.
[02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:29.080]   - But it's, there's this hope is,
[02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:32.760]   it remains this weird place of brilliant innovation
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:36.400]   amidst a state that's like more conservative.
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:38.400]   So like there's a nice balance of everything.
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:40.400]   What are your thoughts about the future of Texas?
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:43.160]   - I think it's so fascinating to me
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:46.880]   because I never thought I would want to move back,
[02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:50.520]   but now I'm beginning to be convinced.
[02:56:50.520 --> 02:56:52.040]   So I'm- - You hear that, Joe?
[02:56:52.040 --> 02:56:53.680]   I'm gonna send you this clip.
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:55.220]   - I am, I'm being honest,
[02:56:55.220 --> 02:56:56.720]   and many Texans will hate me for this.
[02:56:56.720 --> 02:57:00.520]   Texas was not a place that was kind to me, quote unquote.
[02:57:00.520 --> 02:57:04.120]   And this is because of my own parent.
[02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:06.960]   Like I was raised in College Station, Texas,
[02:57:06.960 --> 02:57:08.760]   which is a town of 50,000.
[02:57:08.760 --> 02:57:10.360]   It's a university town.
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:13.040]   It exists only for the university.
[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:16.320]   So it was a very, I did not get the full Texas experience.
[02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:19.240]   It's purely speaking from a College Station experience.
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:23.640]   But growing up, first generation,
[02:57:23.640 --> 02:57:25.280]   or I forget what it is, whatever.
[02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:26.180]   I'm the first American,
[02:57:26.180 --> 02:57:27.880]   I was born and raised in College Station.
[02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:29.160]   My parents are from India.
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:34.820]   Being raised in a town where the dominant culture
[02:57:34.820 --> 02:57:38.840]   was predominantly like white evangelical Christian was hard.
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:40.520]   Like it was just difficult.
[02:57:40.520 --> 02:57:45.160]   And I think of it, in the beginning,
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:48.240]   I would say like ages like zero to like eight,
[02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:50.520]   it was like cultural ignorance,
[02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:53.480]   as in like they just don't know how to interact with you.
[02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:55.600]   And there was a level of,
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:57:58.560]   always there was like the evangelical kind of antipathy
[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:01.120]   towards like you being not Christian.
[02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:02.200]   You know, my parents are Hindu,
[02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:03.840]   like that's how I was raised.
[02:58:03.840 --> 02:58:05.880]   And so like there was that.
[02:58:05.880 --> 02:58:08.200]   But 9/11 was very difficult.
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:13.000]   Like 9/11 happened when I was in third or fourth grade.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000]   And that changed everything, man.
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:18.400]   Like, I mean, our temple had to like print out t-shirts.
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:20.400]   And I'm not saying this is a sob story, to be clear.
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:22.960]   I've still actually largely for my adult life
[02:58:22.960 --> 02:58:24.160]   identified on the political right.
[02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:27.080]   So don't take this as some like, you know, race manifesto.
[02:58:27.080 --> 02:58:29.160]   I'm just telling it like this is what happened.
[02:58:29.160 --> 02:58:32.480]   Which is that, like we had,
[02:58:32.480 --> 02:58:35.300]   it was just hard to be brown, frankly.
[02:58:35.300 --> 02:58:40.300]   And to have some of the fallout from 9/11 and during Iraq.
[02:58:40.300 --> 02:58:45.520]   And the reason I am political is because I realize
[02:58:45.520 --> 02:58:49.640]   in myself I have a strong rebellious nature
[02:58:49.640 --> 02:58:52.960]   against systems and structures of power.
[02:58:52.960 --> 02:58:55.680]   And the first people I ever rebelled against
[02:58:55.680 --> 02:58:58.840]   were all the people telling me to shut up
[02:58:58.840 --> 02:59:00.640]   and not question the Iraq War.
[02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:02.640]   So the reason I am in politics
[02:59:02.640 --> 02:59:07.300]   is because I hated George W. Bush with a passion
[02:59:07.300 --> 02:59:08.820]   and I hated the war.
[02:59:08.820 --> 02:59:10.920]   And I was so, again, my entire background
[02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:12.680]   is largely in national security for this reason,
[02:59:12.680 --> 02:59:15.360]   which is I was obsessed with the idea
[02:59:15.360 --> 02:59:18.300]   of like how do we get people who are not gonna get us
[02:59:18.300 --> 02:59:21.340]   into these quagmire situations in positions of power.
[02:59:21.340 --> 02:59:24.180]   That's how I became fascinated by power in the first place
[02:59:24.180 --> 02:59:27.780]   was all a question of how do this happen?
[02:59:27.780 --> 02:59:30.420]   Like how did this catastrophe happen?
[02:59:30.420 --> 02:59:32.260]   I realized it's not as bad as like, you know,
[02:59:32.260 --> 02:59:34.500]   the previous conflicts, but this one was mine.
[02:59:34.500 --> 02:59:38.080]   And to see how it changed our domestic politics forever.
[02:59:38.080 --> 02:59:40.760]   And so that was my rebellion.
[02:59:40.760 --> 02:59:43.000]   But it's funny 'cause I identified as a left,
[02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:46.520]   on the left when I was growing up, up until I was 18.
[02:59:46.520 --> 02:59:48.720]   I had also a funny two-year stint.
[02:59:48.720 --> 02:59:50.240]   This is where everything kind of changed for me.
[02:59:50.240 --> 02:59:53.760]   When I was 16, actually, I moved to Qatar, to Doha, Qatar.
[02:59:53.760 --> 02:59:57.400]   'Cause my dad was the dean or associate dean
[02:59:57.400 --> 03:00:00.160]   of Texas A&M University at Doha.
[03:00:00.160 --> 03:00:02.160]   So my last two years of high school were at this.
[03:00:02.160 --> 03:00:04.160]   I went from this small town in Texas.
[03:00:04.160 --> 03:00:07.440]   And I love my parents because they could recognize
[03:00:07.440 --> 03:00:10.160]   that I had within me that I was not a small town kid.
[03:00:10.160 --> 03:00:13.320]   So they took me out of this country every chance they got.
[03:00:13.320 --> 03:00:16.440]   I traveled everywhere and constantly let me go.
[03:00:16.440 --> 03:00:20.120]   And so I went from school in College Station
[03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:24.400]   to like this ritzy private school, American school.
[03:00:24.400 --> 03:00:26.160]   Best thing that ever happened to me
[03:00:26.160 --> 03:00:29.560]   because first of all, it got me out of College Station.
[03:00:29.560 --> 03:00:34.320]   Second, at that time, I had this annoying streak of,
[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:36.440]   I wouldn't call it being anti-America,
[03:00:36.440 --> 03:00:38.680]   but you don't appreciate America.
[03:00:38.680 --> 03:00:40.400]   Let me tell everybody out there listening,
[03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:41.720]   leave for a while.
[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:44.960]   You will miss it so much.
[03:00:44.960 --> 03:00:47.760]   You do not know what it is like
[03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:50.960]   to not have freedom of speech until you don't have it.
[03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:55.960]   And I was going to high school with these guys
[03:00:55.960 --> 03:00:58.000]   in the Qatari royal family.
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:00:59.960]   And all I wanted to do was speak out
[03:00:59.960 --> 03:01:01.440]   of how they were pieces of shit
[03:01:01.440 --> 03:01:03.800]   for the way that they treated Indian citizens
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:06.960]   in that country who are basically used as slave labor.
[03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:08.800]   And I could not say one word
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:10.520]   because I knew I would be deported.
[03:01:10.520 --> 03:01:12.520]   And I know my dad would lose his job
[03:01:12.520 --> 03:01:14.040]   and my mom would lose her job.
[03:01:14.040 --> 03:01:15.960]   And we would be forced out of the country.
[03:01:15.960 --> 03:01:17.680]   You don't know what it's like to live like that
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:20.280]   or to be in a society where like,
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:22.480]   you have like a high school girlfriend or something
[03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:25.120]   and you can't even touch in public
[03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:27.640]   or you're lectured for public decency.
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:31.160]   Like, listen, I've lived under a Gulf monarchy now.
[03:01:31.160 --> 03:01:36.160]   And that turned me into the most pro-America guy ever.
[03:01:36.160 --> 03:01:40.800]   Like I came back so like America, like pro.
[03:01:40.800 --> 03:01:43.760]   And I still am, frankly, because of that experience.
[03:01:43.760 --> 03:01:46.240]   Living abroad, like that will do it to you.
[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:48.400]   Live in a non-democracy.
[03:01:48.400 --> 03:01:51.600]   You have, even in Europe, I would say,
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:53.240]   you guys aren't living as free as we are here.
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:55.160]   It's awesome and I love it.
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:56.680]   - You're ultimately another human being
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:01:58.440]   than the one who left Texas.
[03:01:58.440 --> 03:01:59.280]   - Yeah.
[03:01:59.280 --> 03:02:02.040]   - So, I mean, have you actually considered
[03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:03.800]   moving to Texas and broadly,
[03:02:03.800 --> 03:02:05.720]   just outside of your own story,
[03:02:05.720 --> 03:02:07.440]   what do you think is the future of Texas?
[03:02:07.440 --> 03:02:09.000]   What is the future of Austin?
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:12.920]   There's so much transformation seemingly happening now
[03:02:12.920 --> 03:02:15.480]   related to Silicon Valley, related to California.
[03:02:15.480 --> 03:02:16.300]   - That's the fascinating part to me,
[03:02:16.300 --> 03:02:19.000]   which is that since I left, it's changed dramatically,
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:22.880]   which is that it used to be like this conservative state
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:25.720]   where the main money to be made was oil
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:26.720]   and everybody knew that.
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:30.440]   Petro, it was a Petro state, Houston, all of that.
[03:02:30.440 --> 03:02:33.240]   Austin was always weird, but it was more of a music town
[03:02:33.240 --> 03:02:34.280]   and a university town.
[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:35.760]   It was not a tech town.
[03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:39.200]   But in the 10 years or so since I left,
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:40.920]   I have begun to realize, I'm like,
[03:02:40.920 --> 03:02:43.240]   well, the Texas I grew up in is over.
[03:02:43.240 --> 03:02:48.240]   It is not a deep red state in any sense of the term.
[03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:51.840]   The number one U-Haul route in the country pre-pandemic
[03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:54.520]   already was San Francisco to Austin, okay?
[03:02:54.520 --> 03:02:57.560]   So you have this massive influx of people
[03:02:57.560 --> 03:03:00.160]   from California and New York,
[03:03:00.160 --> 03:03:03.080]   and the state, the composition of it
[03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:06.280]   is changed dramatically, the intra-composition
[03:03:06.280 --> 03:03:08.080]   and the outtra, or yeah.
[03:03:08.080 --> 03:03:10.520]   So the intra-composition, it's become way more urban.
[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:13.580]   So when I grew up, Texas was a much more rural state.
[03:03:13.580 --> 03:03:15.480]   Its politics were much more static.
[03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:18.320]   It looked much more like Rick Perry.
[03:03:18.320 --> 03:03:22.640]   He was a very accurate representation of who we were.
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:25.400]   Now, I don't think that that's the case.
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:28.160]   Texas is now a dynamic economy,
[03:03:28.160 --> 03:03:30.960]   not just 100% reliant on oil
[03:03:30.960 --> 03:03:32.680]   because of its kind of like,
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:35.760]   I would call it like regulatory arbitrage
[03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:38.080]   relative to California and New York,
[03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:41.560]   offers a large incentive to people who are more,
[03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:43.040]   I wouldn't say culturally liberal,
[03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:45.400]   but they're not necessarily like culturally conservative,
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:47.160]   like the people who I grew up with.
[03:03:47.160 --> 03:03:49.200]   That's changed the whole state's politics.
[03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:51.920]   Beto came two points away from beating Ted Cruz.
[03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:53.480]   I'm not saying the state's gonna go blue.
[03:03:53.480 --> 03:03:55.480]   I think the Republican Party will just change
[03:03:55.480 --> 03:03:57.080]   and we'll have to readjust.
[03:03:57.080 --> 03:04:01.640]   But the re-urbanization of Texas has made it,
[03:04:01.640 --> 03:04:03.200]   I'll put it in this way,
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:08.200]   much more attractive to me than the place that I grew up.
[03:04:08.200 --> 03:04:11.920]   - And then from my perspective, well, first of all,
[03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:16.640]   I love some of the cowboy things that Texas stands for,
[03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:18.700]   but for more practically, from my perspective,
[03:04:18.700 --> 03:04:23.120]   the injection of the tech innovation
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:27.820]   that's moving to Texas has made it very exciting to me.
[03:04:27.820 --> 03:04:29.740]   It seems like outside of all that,
[03:04:29.740 --> 03:04:32.020]   maybe you can speak to the weird in Austin.
[03:04:32.020 --> 03:04:37.020]   It seems like, I know that Joe Rogan is a rich,
[03:04:37.020 --> 03:04:42.940]   sort of almost like mainstream at this point,
[03:04:42.940 --> 03:04:45.240]   but he's also attracting a lot of weirdos.
[03:04:45.240 --> 03:04:46.800]   And so is Elon.
[03:04:46.800 --> 03:04:48.700]   And a lot of those weirdos are my friends.
[03:04:48.700 --> 03:04:52.540]   And they're like Michael Malice, those weirdos.
[03:04:52.540 --> 03:04:55.800]   And it's like, I have a hope for Austin
[03:04:55.800 --> 03:04:57.860]   that all kinds of different flavors of weirdos
[03:04:57.860 --> 03:04:58.980]   will get injected.
[03:04:58.980 --> 03:05:00.100]   - It's possible.
[03:05:00.100 --> 03:05:02.860]   I actually think the most significant thing that happened
[03:05:02.860 --> 03:05:06.180]   were Tesla moving there.
[03:05:06.180 --> 03:05:08.340]   The reason why is I love Joe, obviously,
[03:05:08.340 --> 03:05:11.260]   but he can only attract X amount of people.
[03:05:11.260 --> 03:05:14.460]   Elon actually employs thousands of people.
[03:05:14.460 --> 03:05:17.000]   And then you will also, Oracle.
[03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:20.840]   Oracle's decision to move to Austin is just as important
[03:05:20.840 --> 03:05:25.440]   because those two men, Larry, was Ellison, right?
[03:05:25.440 --> 03:05:27.240]   Ellison and Elon,
[03:05:27.240 --> 03:05:30.040]   they actually employ tens of thousands
[03:05:30.040 --> 03:05:31.320]   of people collectively.
[03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:33.720]   That can change the nature of the city.
[03:05:33.720 --> 03:05:36.600]   So you combine that with Joe bringing
[03:05:36.600 --> 03:05:39.080]   this entire new entertainment complex
[03:05:39.080 --> 03:05:42.760]   with the bodies of people who will appreciate
[03:05:42.760 --> 03:05:44.580]   said entertainment complex.
[03:05:44.580 --> 03:05:46.220]   - Spend money on the entertainment.
[03:05:46.220 --> 03:05:47.060]   - Exactly.
[03:05:47.060 --> 03:05:48.820]   You just remade the entire city.
[03:05:48.820 --> 03:05:50.900]   And that's why I'm fascinated.
[03:05:50.900 --> 03:05:52.260]   And obviously there's network effects,
[03:05:52.260 --> 03:05:54.700]   which is now that all those people are down there.
[03:05:54.700 --> 03:05:55.980]   I mean, if I were Elon Musk,
[03:05:55.980 --> 03:05:57.460]   I would donate a shit ton of money
[03:05:57.460 --> 03:05:58.620]   to the University of Texas.
[03:05:58.620 --> 03:06:01.340]   And I would turn it into my Stanford for Silicon Valley.
[03:06:01.340 --> 03:06:03.180]   Let's introduce some competition
[03:06:03.180 --> 03:06:07.140]   and let UT Austin hire the best software developers,
[03:06:07.140 --> 03:06:08.860]   engineers, professors, and more,
[03:06:08.880 --> 03:06:12.960]   and turn Texas into a true Austin revolving door hub
[03:06:12.960 --> 03:06:14.800]   where people come to UT Austin
[03:06:14.800 --> 03:06:16.560]   to get an internship at Tesla
[03:06:16.560 --> 03:06:18.480]   and then become an executive there
[03:06:18.480 --> 03:06:20.040]   and then create their own company
[03:06:20.040 --> 03:06:22.720]   in their own garage in Austin,
[03:06:22.720 --> 03:06:24.600]   which is the next Facebook, Twitter.
[03:06:24.600 --> 03:06:25.760]   That's how it happens.
[03:06:25.760 --> 03:06:27.680]   This is why I'm much more skeptical of Miami.
[03:06:27.680 --> 03:06:29.440]   There's a whole tech Miami crew.
[03:06:29.440 --> 03:06:32.280]   I'm like, yeah, there's no university.
[03:06:32.280 --> 03:06:34.080]   It's pretty inorganic.
[03:06:34.080 --> 03:06:35.480]   Look, I think Miami is awesome.
[03:06:35.480 --> 03:06:38.520]   I just, I don't know if the same building blocks are there.
[03:06:38.520 --> 03:06:42.100]   And also no multibillion dollar companies
[03:06:42.100 --> 03:06:44.880]   which employ thousands of people are coming there.
[03:06:44.880 --> 03:06:45.920]   That's the ingredient.
[03:06:45.920 --> 03:06:47.360]   It's not just Joe Rogan.
[03:06:47.360 --> 03:06:48.960]   It's not just even Elon Musk,
[03:06:48.960 --> 03:06:50.680]   if he's still operated in California.
[03:06:50.680 --> 03:06:52.760]   It's all the people he employs.
[03:06:52.760 --> 03:06:55.320]   I think that is where,
[03:06:55.320 --> 03:06:57.920]   I think Texas is going to dramatically change
[03:06:57.920 --> 03:06:59.440]   within the next 10 years.
[03:06:59.440 --> 03:07:00.440]   Alternative to our,
[03:07:00.440 --> 03:07:03.320]   it's already become a more urbanized state
[03:07:03.320 --> 03:07:05.800]   that's moved away from oil and gas
[03:07:05.800 --> 03:07:07.480]   in terms of like its emphasis,
[03:07:07.480 --> 03:07:09.880]   not necessarily in terms of his real economics.
[03:07:09.880 --> 03:07:11.160]   And 10 years from now,
[03:07:11.160 --> 03:07:14.320]   I don't think it will be necessarily the name prop
[03:07:14.320 --> 03:07:16.400]   like of the town.
[03:07:16.400 --> 03:07:19.360]   The only question to me is how that manifests politically
[03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:22.080]   because it's very possible though,
[03:07:22.080 --> 03:07:24.200]   because a lot of these workers themselves
[03:07:24.200 --> 03:07:27.340]   are California culturally liberal.
[03:07:27.340 --> 03:07:29.680]   You could see a Gavin Newsom type person
[03:07:29.680 --> 03:07:31.960]   getting elected governor of Texas
[03:07:31.960 --> 03:07:34.400]   or like the mayor of Austin.
[03:07:34.400 --> 03:07:36.400]   I mean, look, mayor of Austin is already a Democrat, right?
[03:07:36.400 --> 03:07:39.480]   Like, I mean, Joe has his own problems with Austin.
[03:07:39.480 --> 03:07:41.920]   It's funny, I remember him leaving LA and I'm like,
[03:07:41.920 --> 03:07:43.800]   "Oh, have you been to Austin?"
[03:07:43.800 --> 03:07:45.320]   (both laughing)
[03:07:45.320 --> 03:07:46.160]   It ain't, you know,
[03:07:46.160 --> 03:07:48.240]   it's not everything you'd cracked up to be,
[03:07:48.240 --> 03:07:49.240]   you know, necessarily.
[03:07:49.240 --> 03:07:50.800]   - But no matter what, you know,
[03:07:50.800 --> 03:07:54.880]   a new place allows the possibility for new ideas,
[03:07:54.880 --> 03:07:57.160]   even if they're somehow left leaning
[03:07:57.160 --> 03:07:58.200]   and all those kinds of things.
[03:07:58.200 --> 03:08:00.320]   I do think the only two things missing
[03:08:00.320 --> 03:08:04.640]   from Austin and Texas are two dudes in a suit
[03:08:05.560 --> 03:08:07.160]   that sometimes have a podcast
[03:08:07.160 --> 03:08:08.720]   talking a bunch of nonsense on a mic.
[03:08:08.720 --> 03:08:11.680]   So let's bring the best suit game to Texas.
[03:08:11.680 --> 03:08:15.120]   I hope you do make it to Texas at some point.
[03:08:15.120 --> 03:08:17.240]   Thanks so much for talking to me.
[03:08:17.240 --> 03:08:18.800]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:08:18.800 --> 03:08:20.040]   with Sagar and Jetty.
[03:08:20.040 --> 03:08:22.000]   And thank you to our sponsors,

[03:08:36.920 --> 03:08:38.880]   from Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:08:38.880 --> 03:08:42.880]   about the idea that what is just and what is legal
[03:08:42.880 --> 03:08:45.000]   are not always the same thing.
[03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:49.320]   He said, "Never forget that what Hitler did in Germany
[03:08:49.320 --> 03:08:50.320]   was legal."
[03:08:50.320 --> 03:08:54.160]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:08:54.160 --> 03:08:56.760]   (upbeat music)
[03:08:56.760 --> 03:08:59.360]   (upbeat music)
