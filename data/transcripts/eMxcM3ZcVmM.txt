[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   - This speaker's not on the program.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.480]   - Not on the program, but I did notice
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.760]   there was a little bit of security here today.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.920]   A little extra security.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.400]   - This is your Sachs red meat moment.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.240]   - Yes. - Okay.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.080]   - All right, here we go.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.200]   A little red meat for Sachs.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.120]   Please welcome me in joining
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.660]   vice presidential candidate, Janie Vance.
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.340]   - Your winner's ride.
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.120]   - Rain Man David Sachs.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.120]   ♪ I'm going all in ♪
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.320]   - And instead, we open source it to the fans
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.920]   and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.920]   - Love you guys.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.300]   - Queen of Quinoa.
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.400]   ♪ I'm going all in ♪
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.240]   - Hey guys.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.060]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.320]   - How are ya?
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.160]   - What's up man? - Thank you.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.480]   - How are ya? - Good to see ya.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.300]   - What's up man? - Good to see you.
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.140]   - How you doing?
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.380]   - Shabba, long time.
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.220]   - All right. - Good to see you.
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.240]   - Good to see you.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.080]   - Hey guys.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.280]   (sighs)
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.360]   - Welcome. - So.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.440]   - Sachs is going to introduce you.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.580]   - Welcome to the Lion's Den.
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.560]   - Who's here with us, Sachs?
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.360]   - Well, do we actually need a big introduction here?
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.560]   But I'll give a few.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.120]   - For those of you who are really bad at context clues,
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.960]   I'm JD Vance.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.120]   I'm running for vice president.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.480]   (all laughing)
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.920]   - And normally, he's beside his wife, Usha,
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.020]   but now you get.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.860]   - That's right.
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.400]   She's at like the Tar Pits or whatever.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.240]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.600]   - Oh yeah.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.680]   - We brought our three kids out here.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.400]   So she wanted to take and see some fossil stuff.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.960]   So they'll have fun.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.680]   - Yeah, well, I'll say a couple of things about JD
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.480]   'cause he's a friend.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.480]   I think what I think really made me want to support JD
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.960]   for Senate and also for the VP position
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.040]   is that I think he represents two,
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.480]   you could almost say contradictions.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.920]   Back in 2003, when JD graduated from high school,
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.760]   you know, this was after the Twin Towers had come down
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.840]   and we gotten involved with the Iraq War.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.800]   He was gung ho to go fight America's enemies
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.200]   and he enlisted in the Marine Corps
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.360]   and went off to serve in the Middle East.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.360]   Eventually, he came to realize that that war was a mistake.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.360]   And I thought that that really represents
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.080]   one of the traits that we really want in a vice president
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.400]   or someone next to the president,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.560]   which is that he had the patriotism
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.400]   and the courage to go serve America,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.240]   but also the wisdom to realize
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.120]   when America shouldn't get involved in a war.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.200]   So I want to just...
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.360]   (audience applauding)
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.520]   The other, like I said, almost contradiction
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.760]   that JD represents is that he had worked
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.880]   in the tech industry.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.680]   He had been a venture capitalist.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.880]   He had been in rooms like this
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   and he understands what it takes
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.160]   to make America a more innovative place.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.440]   At the same time, he comes from a part
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.520]   of the Midwest, Appalachia.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.840]   That's a very poor part of the country
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.560]   and did not grow up in a privileged environment at all.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.280]   And he still remembers those people
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.040]   and he represents those people.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.320]   And I think his ability to understand both parts
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.440]   of the country makes him,
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.920]   I'd say a pretty unique political figure.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920]   So with that, let me stop.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.240]   And do you want to react to any of that?
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.480]   - Well, first of all, thanks all for having me.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.800]   I've been a big fan of the pod for a while.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.760]   I think my first appearance.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.720]   So it's good to be with you.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.840]   The only thing I'll say to that, David,
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.080]   is I do think there is a deep connection
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.360]   between the poverty that I saw growing up
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.160]   and the fact that our entire economy
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.760]   is just less innovative than we pretend that it is.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.560]   And I know Peter Thiel and Tyler Callahan
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.000]   and other folks have talked about this,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.840]   but if you look at the real innovation
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.800]   in the American economy,
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.560]   it's been in the world of software.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.160]   If you look at where the economy has been most stagnant,
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.320]   it's been in basically
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.600]   the heavily regulated parts of the economy,
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.160]   which is where 90% of the people
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.600]   that I represent in the Senate
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.760]   and 80% of the people that I hope to represent
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.800]   as their vice president actually make their living,
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.240]   run their business and go to work every single day.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.400]   And I think that, you know, when I think about tech,
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.880]   one of the things I'd like us to do
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.600]   is broaden the aperture a little bit
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.000]   and think about innovation, not just in software,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.120]   but innovation in transportation and logistics
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.600]   and innovation in energy and the whole suite of things,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.720]   because unless our economy
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.760]   is actually technologically innovative,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.360]   then the stagnant economy
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.560]   is fundamentally like the worst thing.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.320]   And I think a lot of actually America's pathologies
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.440]   right now stem from the fact
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.440]   that we feel like we live in a very zero-sum country,
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   because in some ways we do, right?
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.120]   When the economy is growing four, five, 6% a year,
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.840]   then Democrats can kind of get what they want,
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   Republicans can kind of get what they want,
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.120]   and it all makes sense.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.120]   If the economy is growing between zero and 1% a year,
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.840]   then I think it makes the whole society
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.800]   and our political system much, much more insane.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.080]   And I think that's kind of a subtext
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.200]   of what's been going on in this country
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.320]   for the last 30 years.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.720]   - Let me start by going back a little bit.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.720]   I think three of us initially would have been described
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.080]   sort of like, you know, non-Trump people.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.920]   - Yeah.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.120]   - And in different ways and shapes and form,
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.440]   we were all vocal about it.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.520]   Because of what was presented to us
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.320]   through the filter of the media.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.000]   And we've all gone through an evolution,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.560]   in large part, by meeting the person.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.200]   And this is the first time, actually,
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.360]   where a presidential candidate I've known,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.000]   and I've kind of known a vice-presidential candidate
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.120]   in this case as well,
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.040]   they try to corner you and pinch you in a certain way.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.520]   Can you just talk about what you realized
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.520]   and the person that you got to know,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.960]   and what it says about what we need to do
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.320]   so that we don't get manipulated?
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.160]   - Yeah.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.480]   So, first of all, when Biden was running against Trump,
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.480]   one of the things the media tried to do is to say,
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.120]   "Well, you know, you have these two guys
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.640]   "who are a little bit older than average,
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.600]   "and both of them clearly aren't fully with it."
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.960]   And I would hear the media talk about Biden like this,
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.240]   and then talk about Trump like this.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.560]   And it's like, guys, Donald Trump remembers
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.640]   exactly what I said about him nine and a half years ago,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.600]   to the minute, to the day, to the exact line.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.120]   Like, trust me, his memory is 100% there,
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.880]   even if it would be more in my interest if it wasn't.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.040]   And, you know, what changed for me, I mean, two things.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.440]   I mean, one, Chamath, you just sort of hit on this,
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.720]   is a lot of the things the press said about Donald Trump
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.360]   and says about Donald Trump
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.800]   are just straight-up fabrications.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.240]   And so if you think the press is, like, biased,
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.200]   that's one thing, but if you think the press
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.840]   is fundamentally trying to tell you the truth,
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.680]   even if it's in a biased way,
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.760]   and then you realize that, like,
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.720]   Donald Trump never called white supremacists
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.600]   very fine people after Charlottesville,
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.760]   a total fabrication of the American media,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.640]   it's like, okay, what other things
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.000]   am I hearing about Donald Trump
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.080]   that are actually not true, right?
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.840]   The second thing is, you know,
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.600]   we talked about this a little bit last night,
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.680]   but look, if you go back to the year of my birth,
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.880]   which is 1984, there's this chart that's really interesting,
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.640]   and it tracks corporate profits, the wages of workers,
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.160]   and the size of government.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.480]   And for pretty much my entire life,
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.400]   the wages of workers were stagnant,
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.160]   corporate profits were going up,
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.000]   and the size of government was going up.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.720]   And there was a four-year period
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.560]   where the wages of workers outpaced
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.280]   the size of government corporate profits.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.840]   It's the four years that Donald Trump was president.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.880]   And I think that we have to, like,
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.760]   give some credit to where it's due,
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.320]   the policies actually work.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.120]   (audience applauds)
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.920]   And if you go into the presidency saying,
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.880]   I don't think Donald Trump's gonna be a good president,
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.920]   and then, lo and behold, he's the best president,
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.840]   at least in a generation, it's like, okay,
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.700]   time to change my mind, admit to myself,
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.080]   but also to all the people who listen to me,
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.400]   I was wrong about Donald Trump,
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.520]   he was a hell of a good president,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.080]   and of course I'm running as his running mate,
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.960]   'cause I think he'll do it again.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.120]   - Let's flip it around now.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.200]   What does it say about him that he,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.040]   I mean, how is that process of saying,
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.080]   J.D., you said this, yes, I did, I changed my mind,
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.320]   but then he has to change his mind.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.200]   So that says something, so talk us through that.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.520]   - You know, I think the president,
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.720]   one thing I'll say about him is,
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.800]   again, the media perception of Donald Trump
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.680]   is that he's like this deeply aggrieved guy
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.680]   who holds really terrible grudges.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.320]   The actual reality of Donald Trump is that,
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.320]   yeah, he remembers what you said about him,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.600]   because it's like part of the inputs that he takes
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.960]   as he tries to evaluate a human being,
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.400]   but most importantly, he's asking like,
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.200]   what can you do now?
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.660]   How can you help the country now?
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.320]   How can you help me as I try to help the country now?
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.560]   And I think for whatever complicated set of factors,
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.440]   he decided that I was the guy who could help him the most.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.040]   But no, I mean, it is interesting,
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.000]   the perception of him as this guy who holds grudges,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.840]   he selected a guy who was very much a critic of his
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.840]   back in 2015 as his running mate.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.400]   Clearly something doesn't make sense.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.700]   And I think that what doesn't make sense is this idea
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.600]   that Trump is more motivated by grievance
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.080]   than he is by the public interest.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.440]   He's actually much more motivated by the public interest.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.760]   That's the truth.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.600]   - That's awesome.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.720]   - Thanks for coming.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.800]   - Of course.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.760]   - You're gonna replace Mike Pence.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.520]   - I hope so.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.340]   - Yeah.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.540]   (laughing)
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.380]   - I have to win first.
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.320]   - It's gonna be a close election, but if you do,
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.600]   Mike Pence, your new boss, Trump,
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.960]   is a little upset at Mike Pence
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.640]   because Mike Pence refused to overturn the election results.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.200]   And if you were in that same position, what would you do?
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.000]   Would you have overturned the election results?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.640]   - Well, I think it's, let me take issue with the premise
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.520]   a little bit, Jason, because I don't think the argument
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.240]   was Mike Pence could overturn the election results.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.480]   I think the argument was that Mike Pence
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.200]   could have done more, whether you agree or disagree.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.480]   Mike Pence could have done more to sort of surface
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.340]   some of the problems in the 2020 election.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.320]   - Would you have not certified the election?
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.200]   - Well, I think that what I would have done,
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.280]   I mean, look, I happen to think that there were issues
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.760]   back in 2020, particularly in Pennsylvania,
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.880]   even some of the courts that refused to throw out
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.360]   certified ballots did say that there were ballots
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.040]   that were cast in an illegal way.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.280]   They just refused to actually decertify
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.080]   the election results in Pennsylvania.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.440]   Do I think that we could have had
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.640]   a much more rational conversation about how to ensure
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.400]   that only legal ballots are cast?
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.220]   Yes.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.060]   And do I think that Mike Pence
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.040]   could have played a better role?
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.880]   Yes.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.280]   But I, again, the two premises that I take issue,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.800]   one is, one, Pence was not asked to overturn the election.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.200]   He couldn't have.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.040]   But two, the reason-
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.480]   - He was asked to not certify it.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.320]   - Sure.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.320]   - So would you have certified?
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.160]   I'll ask you for the third thing.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.880]   - Again, I would have asked the states
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.280]   to submit alternative slates of electors
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.200]   and let the country have the debate
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.080]   about what actually matters
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.600]   and what kind of an election that we had
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.440]   in these important states. - You wouldn't have
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.980]   certified, to be clear.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.360]   - I would have asked the states
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.560]   to submit alternative slates of electors.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.480]   - I think that's what you're saying.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.320]   - That's what I would have done.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.960]   Again, I've said that publicly many times.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.120]   But again, Jason, the important part is
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.720]   we would have had a big debate.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.560]   - Got it.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.680]   - And it doesn't necessarily mean the results
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.680]   would have been any different,
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.320]   but we at least would have had the debate
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.980]   in Pennsylvania and Georgia
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.280]   about how to better have a rational election system
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.400]   where legal ballots are cast.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.120]   And again, look, I have no personal problem with Mike Pence.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.000]   I've never really talked to him.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.160]   But I think that the idea that the reason Mike Pence
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.520]   isn't on board with Donald Trump
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.480]   is over the election of 2020.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.300]   That's the other thing I would take issue with, Jason,
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.440]   because I think in reality that if Donald Trump
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.240]   wanted to start a nuclear war with Russia,
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.560]   Mike Pence would be at the front of the line
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.760]   endorsing him right now.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.040]   And fundamentally, the reason the old guard
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.080]   of the Republican Party hates Donald Trump,
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.840]   it's not because of January the 6th, 2021,
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.080]   whatever your views on it.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.880]   It's because Donald Trump doesn't think
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.200]   that we should start stupid wars in foreign countries,
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.320]   and that's why they all hate him.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.320]   (audience applauding)
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.720]   - Brian, can I, I have a follow-up on that.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.960]   Let me continue my line of questioning,
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.080]   and then I'll give it to you.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.640]   'Cause I wanna hear J.D.'s since he's here.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.080]   I've heard yours many times.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.640]   - How many follow-ups are you gonna have
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.480]   about January the 6th?
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.200]   We've been spending 20 minutes talking about it.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.720]   - I wanna hear David, especially if he gets me
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.240]   out of answering tough questions.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.000]   - I think we've heard, you've had like three follow-ups
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.840]   on J.D.'s.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.240]   First of all, Freeberg, you never got a chance
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.080]   to ask your question.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.120]   - Well, I wanna talk about policy.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.280]   - Let's talk about January 6th for the next 45 minutes.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.600]   I'm sure it's the most important thing
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.440]   going on in the country right now.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.000]   - Can we talk about policy for a minute?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.840]   - That'd be great.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.680]   - Okay.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.500]   - I'd love that.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.480]   - I'll just reflect back on your comment
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.040]   about government growth compared to wage growth
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.600]   compared to corporate profits.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.020]   There's only so much capital, it gets sucked up somewhere.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.860]   - That's right.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.680]   - There's competing interests that suck it up.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.080]   The government is a competing interest
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.960]   that sucks up capital, fundamentally.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.680]   The government has been successful in sucking up capital.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.760]   And ultimately, the government has been proven time and again
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.480]   to be the least efficient way to grow the economy
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.600]   of allocating capital allocators or labor.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.120]   And Trump has made this commentary
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.900]   that Elon, who's gonna be here later today,
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.280]   should come in and help right-size the government.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.120]   You've now spent a few years as a senator.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.240]   This is my most distressing issue, right,
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.960]   of all the panic attacks I have that Jason teases me about.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.080]   (Jason laughing)
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.240]   Government spending, the debt level,
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.200]   and ultimately, you reach a tipping point,
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.560]   I believe, in democracies where the government is spending.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.680]   More people are dependent on the government than are not,
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.780]   and that ultimately leads
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.760]   to a very bad outcome for democracy.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.920]   - That's right. - That's how I feel.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.960]   And so, based on what you've seen as a senator now
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.800]   for the last few years,
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.080]   and based on the commentary that Elon,
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.360]   where would you go in, you know, cut?
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.360]   Where's the most kind of efficiency-gaining opportunity
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.200]   that we can kind of execute against
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.660]   without needing to go and negotiate with Congress?
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.520]   What's the opportunity ahead for the executive branch
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.800]   to right-size government, to make things more efficient,
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.280]   to hold things accountable,
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.060]   to improve the way that the government is functioning,
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.920]   which I think ultimately leads to better economic growth
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.400]   and opportunity for innovation,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.080]   'cause capital flows to the right places.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.120]   - So, I agree with you, and let me just say,
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.800]   let me say two things, and I'll try to answer briefly,
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   'cause I know there are a lot of topics
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.620]   that we can get through.
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.840]   So, number one is, one of the things
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.440]   that our government should do, obviously,
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.680]   I think it should be doing less than it currently does,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.760]   but what it does, I want it to do well,
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.760]   and most importantly,
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.060]   I want the critical social welfare functions
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.680]   of our government to go to the people
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.920]   who actually deserve to be here.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.720]   So, as a United States Senator,
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.340]   I have asked multiple staff members,
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.760]   I've asked officials in various government departments,
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.880]   if you take the give or take 25 million illegal aliens
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.560]   that are here in this country right now,
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.320]   how much money do we spend on illegal aliens
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.960]   every single year in this country?
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.560]   And I've gotten estimates that range
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.240]   between $100 billion a year to $600 billion a year.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.440]   And where does that money come from?
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.960]   Well, it comes from healthcare benefits,
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.560]   even though illegal aliens aren't entitled
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.880]   to Section 8 housing,
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.720]   their children are entitled to Section 8 housing,
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.260]   there's also a lot of social security fraud,
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.520]   a lot of Medicare fraud.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.200]   So, one thing that we could save a lot of money on
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   is actually focusing our national interest
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.640]   on American citizens, people who deserve to be here,
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.800]   we'd save a lot of money that way,
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.040]   that'd be a huge and transformative thing.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.680]   - Of the $7.3 trillion budget,
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.120]   what do you estimate that impact to be?
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.960]   - Well, again, it's--
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.360]   - And I'm trying to do that scene in the movie "Dave,"
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.680]   where they go in and they just like line up,
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.560]   they're like, "Nope, nope,"
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.360]   or like Millet did where he pulled everything off the board.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.480]   - If you call it a $1.7 trillion deficit, right?
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.440]   Again, it's between $100 billion to $600 billion,
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.440]   depending on how you cut the numbers.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.600]   Now, the other thing about that,
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.500]   just to answer your question about efficiency is,
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.220]   I think the government procurement process,
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.180]   especially in military equipment, is really broken.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.100]   If you go back to Eisenhower's warning
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.040]   about the military-industrial complex,
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.980]   I mean, I was a seed investor in Anduril,
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.940]   I imagine you guys have some Anduril people here today.
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.780]   Great, great--
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.600]   - We had Palmer Luckey here two years ago.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.440]   - Great company.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.660]   - Yeah, great chap, Jacob.
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.340]   - You know, one of the things that that company,
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.340]   as I haven't talked to the guys
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.560]   about the details of the business in the last few years,
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.900]   but one of the things that they founded the company on
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.320]   was the idea that the procurement process was broken.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.920]   And that is definitely true in the, you know,
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.920]   we do way too much cost-plus procurement
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.760]   and way too little actual spurring of innovation.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.560]   And what it ends up meaning is that our equipment
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.760]   isn't as good as it should be,
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.180]   and we end up spending a lot more money than we should be.
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.700]   I actually do think you could cut
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.340]   the American defense budget and make our country stronger,
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.200]   but you would have to make the procurement process
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.040]   much more efficient.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.480]   Now, that's a big thing to tackle,
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.360]   but that's what we're in this business of doing,
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.200]   is big things. - You need legislation
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.020]   to do that.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.980]   - I don't know that you have to pass legislation,
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.060]   but you really, as a president and vice president,
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.100]   you have to be willing to take on
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.300]   some very powerful defense contractors.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.740]   And that's something that I know President Trump
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.820]   and I very much want to do.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.560]   - And how would you like your role
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.680]   as vice president to be cast,
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.300]   differentially from how other vice presidents have operated?
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.340]   What would your role as an individual be,
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.380]   just speaking about?
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.700]   - I want to do all of the good things
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.540]   and none of the bad things.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.420]   That's my goal as vice president.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.260]   That's--
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.080]   - So the ribbon cuttings-- - I've asked.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:57.920]   - Of the new federal-- - I've asked.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.420]   (laughing)
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.360]   I mean, look, I mean, obviously joking,
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.460]   but the reality is that I want to be
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.980]   a second set of eyes and ears
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.460]   for the president's agenda, right?
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.820]   One of the things that was true,
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.740]   and he will tell you this,
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.900]   the first time he was president of the United States,
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.940]   is there were people in government,
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.620]   there were people in his own administration,
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.020]   that he was a newcomer to politics,
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.800]   he didn't fully trust everybody who was around him.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.860]   We want to build a team
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.140]   who's actually aligned on the agenda,
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.400]   because agree or disagree with Donald Trump
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.980]   on a specific policy issue,
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.260]   assuming the American people make him the next president,
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.660]   and I think that they will,
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.300]   that is the next president.
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.300]   And his policy determinations
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.100]   should dictate the executive administration of government.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.820]   If they don't, we don't have a real democracy.
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.780]   And by the way,
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.300]   just not to wade back into January 6th territory,
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.460]   like what is a bigger threat to American democracy?
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.900]   Is it that we had a big fight
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.460]   about some of the certification in January the 6th,
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.500]   and of course you had some rioters at the Capitol,
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.260]   or is it that, for example,
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.740]   the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.900]   didn't obey the president of the United States
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.820]   on troop redeployments in Syria,
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.300]   which actually happened during Trump's administration.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.660]   Like, if we're gonna talk about threats to democracy,
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.820]   we need the government to be responsive
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.900]   to the American people's elected president.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.980]   If you don't have that, you don't have a real democracy.
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.820]   - How much...
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.980]   (audience applauding)
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:20.540]   A lot of this, if you design it in one way,
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.500]   it has to go through Congress,
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.940]   which, as we know, is sclerotic,
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.060]   and basically nothing can happen.
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.240]   And then the other path
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.940]   is for you guys to go ham a little bit,
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.100]   and say, okay, what can we do with executive order?
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.780]   Have you had a chance to discuss, if you win,
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.860]   repositioning the focus as basically that?
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.660]   What is the totality of everything that we can do
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.300]   from the White House, from the Oval,
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.460]   and then getting all of these...
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.220]   And the other thing that we should talk about at some point
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.580]   is it's like a "Avengers" movie now, at this point.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.580]   You, Bobby Kennedy, Elon, Trump, so, but...
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.220]   I don't...
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.060]   - The Justice League?
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.460]   - The Justice League.
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.820]   - I don't know which character in that Justice League I am.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.500]   - But the point is, have you had that discussion about,
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.420]   all right, folks, let's not wait for Congress
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.700]   and get a plan ready, starting day one,
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.580]   of all the stuff that can happen through EOs,
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.860]   or how are you thinking about this?
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.660]   - At a high level, certainly,
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.340]   I'm one of the co-chairs of the transition team.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.440]   There are a few others of us who are working on it.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.740]   You have to sort of think about, I mean, look,
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.180]   the way the founders set up our government,
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.980]   whether you like it or not, there are certain things,
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.500]   especially when it comes to budget and appropriations,
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.140]   you just have to go through Congress, right?
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.480]   You fundamentally have to.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.340]   Now, I do think that Congress is willing to work with us
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.340]   at least the first couple of years of an administration.
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.660]   You can largely get the budgetary
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.620]   and appropriations things that you need,
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.460]   but there's a lot that you can do through EO.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.940]   And by the way, in a lot of ways,
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.780]   I think the enlargement of the president
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.060]   at the expense of Congress is a bad thing,
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.300]   but fundamentally, there is a lot that happens
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.380]   in our government purely through executive orders,
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.580]   through EOs, and yes, we're thinking very deliberatively
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.700]   about all the things that you could do through EOs
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.300]   on day one or in the early parts of the administration,
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.020]   and again, not to make this too partisan,
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.860]   but one of the ways that Biden and Harris
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.460]   opened up the American southern border
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.860]   was through executive orders, right?
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.540]   It was an executive order that suspended deportations,
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.300]   an executive order that ended the remain in Mexico policy.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.660]   So you can screw up a lot through EOs.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.520]   You can also fix a lot through EOs,
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.100]   which is certainly something that we're focused on.
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.620]   - Let me go in a different direction.
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.580]   Just in the last couple of days,
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:26.220]   Dick Cheney endorsed Kamala Harris for president,
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.260]   and that endorsement was warmly embraced
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.460]   by Kamala Harris and the Democrats.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.780]   - But some people called him a war criminal
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.140]   like three years ago.
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.220]   - Yeah, well, yeah, I'm old enough to remember
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.820]   back in 2008, Obama first beat Hillary Clinton
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.220]   in the Democratic primary
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.820]   because he had opposed the Iraq war and she had supported it,
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.820]   and then he got elected president of the United States,
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.380]   and the whole country seemed to recognize
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.540]   that the Iraq war had been a disaster.
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.640]   It destabilized the Middle East.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.540]   It, you know, I don't need to go through all the litanies
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.500]   of horribles that happened from it,
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.140]   but there seemed to be a widespread recognition.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.380]   And like you're saying, Dick Cheney was kind of demonized
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.460]   as this, like the Darth Vader, Prince of Darkness
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.260]   type figure, which I think basically was right.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.620]   I mean, he was the principal architect of the Iraq war.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.340]   - Now I find myself agreeing with everything
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.000]   the Democrats said in 2008 about Dick Cheney.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.840]   - Right.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.660]   - Total coincidence.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.020]   - On a separate track, a few weeks ago,
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.900]   we had Bobby Kennedy endorse Donald Trump.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.620]   So you now have a dynamic where the Bush Republicans
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.500]   are now Harris Democrats, and the Kennedy Democrats
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.060]   are now Trump Republicans.
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:30.900]   - Right.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.820]   - Clearly, something big is happening in our politics here.
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.460]   Can you explain this realignment?
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.620]   How do you see it?
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.660]   - Yeah, I mean, look, one way to think about it
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.020]   is that we traded Dick Cheney for Bobby Kennedy,
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.800]   and that's an upgrade I'll take every single day.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.340]   (audience applauding)
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.740]   But, look, I mean, one way of understanding
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.140]   is you have to ask yourself who has benefited
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.980]   and who has harmed from the last 30 years
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.940]   of the bipartisan consensus in this country, right?
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.420]   So you wanna talk about a manufacturing policy
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.220]   that I think promoted the offshoring
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.580]   of millions of good American manufacturing jobs,
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.240]   and in the process, by the way,
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.080]   made us less self-reliant as a country.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.780]   That really benefited people like Dick Cheney
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.420]   and Kamala Harris and their donors.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.280]   It didn't benefit the people that I serve
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.020]   in the state of Ohio, okay?
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.780]   If you ask yourself who actually went off
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.540]   and fought these ridiculous wars,
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.720]   it was very often working and middle-class kids
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.140]   in communities like mine.
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.420]   It wasn't the family
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.700]   of our current leadership class, by and large,
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.140]   though, of course, there are exceptions.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.500]   And you go through each of these issues,
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.260]   and what you find is increasingly Republicans
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:36.220]   are the party of working and middle-class people.
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.940]   You know, Bobby Kennedy has talked about this a lot,
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.380]   and I think he puts it better than I ever could,
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.440]   but that, you know, you go back even 30 years ago,
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.740]   and approximately 80% of the counties that represent,
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.820]   sorry, 80% of the wealth in American counties
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.700]   went in places that voted Republican,
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.900]   and about 20% of the wealth went to places
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.020]   that voted Democrat.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.780]   Now it's 70% of the wealth goes for Democrats,
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.300]   and about 30% of the wealth goes for Republicans.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.420]   And you saw this in a big way.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.420]   I mean, just one illustration is I believe
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.100]   that in 2012, Wall Street,
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.580]   which I think Wall Street fundamentally
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.740]   has been the main beneficiary of globalization,
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.240]   of a lot of the policies that I push back against
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.080]   and criticize over the last 30 years,
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.480]   Wall Street went three to one for Romney over Obama in 2012.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.560]   I believe they went four to one
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:26.040]   for Clinton over Trump in 2016,
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.240]   and then like nine to one for Biden over Trump in 2020.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.320]   So there is a massive shift in who makes up these parties.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.360]   - Wealthy people direct their money to Democrats as well.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.280]   - Increasingly, wealthy people direct their money
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.600]   to Democrats, working and middle-class people
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.780]   direct their money to Republicans.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.420]   - Why do you think that is, J.D.?
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.500]   - Again, because I think their policies have benefited,
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.420]   look, the UNA party, the Kamala Harris's and Dick Cheney's,
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.420]   their parties have benefited a certain group of people.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.800]   Those people are increasingly Democrats.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.180]   Donald Trump has been pushing back against that consensus
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.580]   in his party, in his policies,
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.540]   I think benefit the majority of the country.
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.740]   So increasingly, I think the working middle-class
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.140]   heart of the country is going for Republicans.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.500]   Like another spin on this,
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.100]   'cause I know we're focused on tech in this conference is,
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.780]   big tech has become increasingly pro-Democrat,
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.200]   little tech has become increasingly pro-Republican, right?
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.080]   So if you're an upstart, if you're in crypto,
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.120]   if you're like a small AI company,
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.760]   I think you're much more likely to be pro-Republican.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.660]   If you're a monopolist in big tech,
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.580]   I mean, look at Facebook, Google,
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.280]   how they're putting their resources.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.480]   It's much, much more pro-Democrat.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.200]   So there are a lot of different spins on it,
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.600]   but fundamentally, I think the people who've benefited
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.880]   from the American decline are becoming Democrats.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.200]   The people who have suffered from it
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.280]   and are pushing back against it are Republicans.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.120]   - I have a follow-up question on that, JD,
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:46.000]   which is, you were a venture capitalist for a period,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.480]   and Lena Kahn has essentially taken M&A off the table.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.140]   You well know that if we can't get those singles
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.320]   and doubles in the industry, it kind of freezes the industry
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.820]   and we have a problem with returns,
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.700]   which then is creating a secondary order problem
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.080]   where we can't get LPs to put more money into funds
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.280]   because we're not getting those returns.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.560]   What's the proper way to look at M&A?
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.000]   Because you wanna break up big tech, from what I understand,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.960]   and you have a major problem with big tech.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.600]   You mentioned little tech.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.960]   What's the proper M&A architecture
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.640]   to balance those two goals there?
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.400]   - Yeah, so this is obviously very complicated.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.180]   Jason, you probably understand this better than I do,
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.400]   but as somebody, by the way, who's defended Lena Kahn
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.520]   against some of her critics from the right,
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.040]   I think what Lena Kahn fundamentally gets correct
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.320]   is that big tech really is a threat.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.920]   It's a threat to free speech.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.360]   It's increasingly oligarchic.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.200]   It controls too much of what we're allowed to say,
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.320]   and also it controls a lot of the ways
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.600]   in which capital gets invested in these various ecosystems.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.360]   But where I think Lena Kahn goes wrong
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.040]   is that you're exactly right.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.640]   You need the singles and doubles.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.620]   You need sometimes a medium-sized company
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.240]   to buy a smaller company for $300 million.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.280]   That liquidates founders.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.080]   That gives the venture fund some money
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.320]   to go back into the system.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.480]   And I think that, I don't know her super well,
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.880]   but my basic read on Lena is that she is so anti-monopoly
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.080]   as sort of a baseline bias,
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.620]   and that becomes anti-merger and acquisition
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.920]   as a baseline bias,
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.800]   that Google buying YouTube is a much, much different thing
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.200]   from a $2 billion market cap healthcare company
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.800]   buying a $500 million market cap healthcare company.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.120]   And I think that we have to sort of draw
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.440]   a very big distinction between little tech and big tech.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.380]   And look, I'm gonna keep on making that argument
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.320]   both in public and private to Lena,
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   and hopefully she comes around to our view a little bit,
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.680]   'cause I do think some of her ideas on big tech are right.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.120]   - I think a good place for us to pivot would be the border.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.840]   And just talking about this issue more from first principles
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.040]   when President Trump came on the podcast,
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.760]   we talked about, hey, maybe really talented people,
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.520]   we should recruit them to our country
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.480]   and give them green cards.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.240]   But very quickly, your group walked that back a bit.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.880]   It's such a political hot potato,
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.560]   and it doesn't seem to me that it needs to be,
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.960]   but you've spent a lot of time in government now.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.840]   Why can't politicians just do
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.520]   what 80% of the country wants,
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.440]   which is allow very talented people into the country,
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:16.440]   close the border, and make it like a more point-based system
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.120]   like Canada, Australia, and everybody else?
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:23.120]   Like, why is this so weaponized by both of your parties?
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.400]   - Well, I think the reason why it's so difficult right now,
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.960]   and I mean, look, generally I agree that, okay,
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.760]   we're gonna let some immigrants in,
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.320]   we want them to be high-talent, high-quality people,
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.520]   you don't wanna let a large number of illegal aliens in.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.720]   Obviously, that's President Trump's view.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.240]   But I think that the reason why it's so broken down
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.880]   right now is because you have 25 million
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.440]   illegal aliens in this country.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.920]   And you can't fix what I would call the minor
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.040]   or sort of less important immigration question
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.120]   until you fix the real problem.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.600]   And part of that goes back, by the way,
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.280]   to the way in which the system got broken in the first place.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.860]   So Ronald Reagan, of course, great governor of California,
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.400]   a great president, but Reagan did, in 1986,
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.520]   a massive amnesty program where, in some ways,
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.000]   he was trying to do exactly what you're talking about.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.140]   Fix the problem of people who are already here,
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.140]   make sure that our immigration system is more pro-skill,
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.960]   but also close down the border.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.760]   And what happened is we got all the amnesty,
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.980]   but we didn't get the closing down of the border.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.280]   And so in order to do anything, I think,
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.080]   meaningful on immigration policy,
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.960]   meaning legal immigration policy,
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.620]   you've got to close down the border
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.980]   and establish some basic order.
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.080]   And to go back to first principles here,
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.720]   I think that people who are generally, I mean, look,
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.440]   this is, I'm sure, a very diverse crowd,
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.220]   and I'm sure there are a lot of immigrants in this crowd,
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.700]   legal immigrants, hopefully.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.660]   I'm married to the daughter,
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.520]   I'm married to the daughter of legal immigrants
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.880]   to this country, and I, of course, love not just my wife,
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.020]   but the whole extended family.
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.300]   I do think they've brought a lot to this country.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.420]   - Three of us are legal immigrants.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.860]   - Yeah, but here's the thing.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.060]   When you allow 25 million people into this country,
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.380]   it breaks down the entire social compact, right?
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.220]   So think about this.
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.300]   Okay, you're down on your luck.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.260]   You lost your job.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.380]   You get unemployment insurance.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.640]   You're really down on your luck.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.160]   You need food assistance from the federal government.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.260]   I believe, as a conservative,
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.260]   that part of being in the same American family,
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.020]   whether your family's been here for a generation
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.340]   or 10 generations, is that we support people
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.360]   who are down on their luck.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.420]   We don't want a cradle-to-grave welfare state,
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.600]   but we want to support people.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.700]   We don't want kids who are dying because of starvation,
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.240]   because of no fault of their own.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.500]   We want to promote some basic fairness,
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.080]   and we want to help people out when times get tough.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.580]   But you can't do that if you extend that generosity
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.860]   to tens of millions of people
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.060]   who can't even be here in the first place.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.900]   And I think that what Kamala Harris has done at the border,
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.380]   it's not just bad economically.
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.180]   It's not just bad for public safety.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.920]   She has eroded the very foundation
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.580]   of the social contract in this country.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.580]   And we talk about division in our politics,
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.660]   and Kamala has this ridiculous slogan,
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.980]   "We're not going back."
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.440]   The reason why politics is so divided
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.680]   is because she has turned American citizens
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.740]   against one another while she's placed
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:03.220]   the interests of illegal aliens above American citizens.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.440]   You want to turn the page
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.840]   and get back to common American citizenship?
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.640]   Stop putting illegal aliens
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.260]   to the front of the line of American citizens.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.240]   - Is the motivation...
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.240]   (audience applauds)
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:21.420]   Do you believe the motivation is endless empathy,
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:26.220]   or is it as simple as we want new Democratic voters,
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.220]   or is there a kind of not publicly spoken
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.580]   about economic argument about bringing wages down,
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.740]   having economic growth, having new buyers in the economy,
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:37.740]   that there's some benefit
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.580]   despite the $100 to $600 billion cost?
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.500]   - And I'll add another one, guilt.
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.420]   - Yeah, the endless empathy aspect, yeah.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.580]   - Yeah, I mean, empathy is different than guilt.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.060]   - It's all of these things, right?
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.860]   I mean, so let me tell you a brief story,
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.980]   and this goes back to my changing my mind
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:51.820]   on Donald Trump.
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.100]   I was probably, it's probably 2017, 2018,
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.460]   I was at a business conference,
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.980]   and I happened to be seated next to one
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.780]   of the largest hotel chain CEOs in America.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.020]   And my wife was there,
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.020]   and we talk about this as the Monopoly story,
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.900]   because the guy is just going off,
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.260]   maybe he'd had too much to drink.
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.060]   He's going off about how Donald Trump's
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.260]   immigration policies had forced him
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.220]   to raise the wages of his workers.
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.380]   And I was like, oh, that's an interesting fact.
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.620]   Like, explain more about this, sir, please.
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.460]   I want to understand.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.780]   And he said, well, because we can hire a lot of immigrants,
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.780]   and frankly, we can hire a lot of illegal immigrants
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.700]   under the table, and we can't do that
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.100]   because there are fewer illegal immigrants,
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.620]   so we have to pay our American citizen workers more money.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.180]   And I'm like, oh shit, that sounds pretty good, actually.
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.260]   Isn't that like what we want,
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.980]   is for people to be earning higher wages
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.260]   for doing a good job?
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.420]   So there's definitely an economic piece of it.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.980]   But I also think, I mean, look,
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.660]   this has chilled out a little bit,
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.060]   partially 'cause we're in election year.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.100]   If Kamala Harris won,
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.860]   I think it would come back with a vengeance.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:46.860]   But think about all these, like,
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.820]   ridiculous land acknowledgements, right?
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.900]   Where people say, well, you know,
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.980]   I want to acknowledge that this belonged
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.460]   to like this tribe before I was here.
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.220]   And if you genuinely think that you have to acknowledge
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.940]   a Native American tribe from 300 years ago,
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.380]   then one attitude that comes along with this is,
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.380]   why can I control at all who comes into the country?
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.460]   Right, I have no right.
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.180]   There's this basic, I think this is the empathy,
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.860]   it's the guilt, it's sort of all these things.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.780]   - But all structural norms degrade.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.620]   - Exactly.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.740]   Like, I have no right to say who comes into my community.
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.260]   And I think, again, it's deranged,
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.180]   but I think that's part of it.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.980]   I think the economic piece of it is part of it.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.220]   It's certainly a vote argument.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.380]   I mean, Democrats will say this.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.740]   Of course, Republicans are accused of racism
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.420]   for just repeating what Democrats have said.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.060]   When somebody like Chuck Schumer says,
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.420]   well, you know, we're going to have
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.980]   an emerging Democratic majority
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.060]   because we're going to have all these new immigrants
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.340]   and all the old Americans,
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.340]   well, they're going to vote for Republicans,
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:41.300]   but we're going to replace them
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.060]   with a bunch of new people who vote for Democrats.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.340]   It's like, that's pretty sick.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.660]   But again, if you call it out,
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.060]   you're somehow a racist,
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.140]   even though Chuck Schumer is himself calling it out
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.380]   as if it were a good thing.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.980]   - I just want to ask on a different topic now.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.940]   Thank you for talking about the border.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.260]   - Can I just have one final on this topic?
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.100]   - Okay, go ahead.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.700]   - Which is, your plan is to deport
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.060]   tens of millions of these people.
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.420]   Tell us how that will happen practically.
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.020]   How are you going to take a million of people,
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.380]   put them in cuffs, drag them out
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.580]   while people have their cell phones out recording this?
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.900]   Or is that just Trump being Trump?
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.460]   - Well, Jason, it's, I like it.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.220]   - You like the balance in the podcast?
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.660]   - Yeah, I do.
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.500]   I do.
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.660]   (audience applauding)
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:28.140]   - In fairness, JD told me,
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.540]   ask the hard questions, please.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.620]   I want to address them head-on.
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.460]   You did say that.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.660]   - No, nothing's off limits.
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.060]   - I think Jason should be on the left
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.220]   and David should be on my right,
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.460]   if we're doing this appropriately.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.300]   - Where am I going?
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.460]   He's been pulling me to the right.
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:39.340]   - I'll go to the audience.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.580]   - It's funny, he didn't have any of these hard questions
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.420]   for Reid Hoffman.
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.260]   I don't know why.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.820]   (audience applauding)
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.460]   - I'm set, I'm set.
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.300]   - Well, Jason.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.220]   - Wait, do you want me to leave the left
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.300]   and go to the right?
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.380]   I'm on the left right now, but I could go right.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.460]   - Okay, yeah, I guess it depends on perspective.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:57.660]   My perspective, you're--
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:58.500]   - It's good debate prep, right?
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.620]   - But, you know, Jason, if the VC thing doesn't work out,
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.620]   you'd make a great panelist at CNN, so.
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:10.220]   By the way, I love this.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.500]   And I genuinely think this is what a person
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.660]   who wants to be your vice president should actually do,
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.740]   is answer some tough questions.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.140]   - I do give you credit for that.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.460]   You will face the hard questions.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.340]   So, back to the question.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.980]   Tell me about dragging millions of people
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.820]   out of the country.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.740]   - Jason, here's why I find this question a little off,
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.220]   and I will answer it, but it's like somebody
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.220]   who comes to me and I'm like eating my lunch,
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.700]   and they say, "Look, that sandwich is 10 times
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.660]   "the size of your mouth.
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.700]   "How are you possibly gonna eat that whole sandwich?"
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.540]   And it's like, "Well, I'm gonna take a first bite,
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.060]   "and then I'm gonna take a second bite,
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.100]   "and then I'm gonna take a third bite."
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.540]   And eventually the problem's gonna be,
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.020]   look, you start out with a million people
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.180]   who are what we call criminal migrants,
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.780]   people who have committed violent crimes
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:52.180]   in some form or another, get them out of our country.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.220]   Yes, handcuff those people and force them
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.140]   out of the country.
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.540]   But you also do other things simultaneously.
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.540]   First of all, you stop the bleeding, right?
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.460]   You undo Kamala Harris's policies
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.700]   that opened the southern border in the first place.
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.580]   I've got a piece of legislation in the United States Senate
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.060]   that we've got a lot of colleagues who have signed up for it
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.580]   which would tax remittances, right?
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.900]   'Cause we know a lot of people are earning money
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.580]   and then sending it back to Central America
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.100]   or wherever they came from.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.380]   If you end that practice,
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.460]   then you have a lot of people who go back willingly.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.820]   I think you ought to make it harder
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.660]   for people to hire illegal labor
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.340]   as opposed to American citizens.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.020]   You tick through these things,
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:29.220]   and I do think that's the sandwich approach to this,
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.460]   is you try to take it one step at a time.
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.220]   But the most important thing,
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.020]   and I think the deportations focus, again, it is important
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.820]   because we're eventually, we are going to deport people,
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.380]   but the most important thing is to stop the bleeding.
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.540]   You've got to stop the millions of people
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.340]   flowing across the southern border every single year.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.580]   It happened because of Kamala Harris's policies.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.420]   It's gonna stop when Donald Trump is president.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.420]   - Let me ask a national security question.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.820]   (audience applauding)
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.060]   There's a lot of videos, Elon's gone down there,
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.060]   Bobby Kennedy's gone down there, you've gone down there.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:34:59.940]   - Sure.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.060]   - And the interdictions are not necessarily coming
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.980]   from countries in Central and South America anymore.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:09.300]   They're coming from places near, around, near Asia.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.220]   And a lot of places that you wouldn't normally think
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.740]   people coming from Middle East, et cetera.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.620]   From a national security perspective,
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.740]   what do we think is happening?
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:17.220]   - Yeah.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.340]   - Why is that happening?
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.740]   - Yeah, so, well, part of the reason it's happening--
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.340]   - Right, it's not Hondurans necessarily.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.220]   - No, no, that's right, no.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.020]   - It's Iranians.
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.860]   - It's Iranians, it's people from, you know,
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:27.860]   all over Asia, Africa, Europe.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.460]   I mean, look, if you look at this,
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.180]   that is the open door, right?
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.700]   So if you want to come to this country,
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:34.580]   that is the open door.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.260]   And God knows why some of them want to be here.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.500]   I mean, you know, given what's going on in the Middle East,
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.980]   I do worry about military age males from Iran.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.220]   I mean, into this country through the southern border.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:46.820]   But, you know, I actually asked a border patrol agent
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.980]   about this on one of my visits.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:53.140]   And, you know, great guy was actually kind of heartbroken
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.700]   because he signed up to protect his country.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.220]   And he's a relatively recent immigrant.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.500]   I could tell that by his accent.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.380]   This guy's like very nervous and very heartbroken
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:02.580]   about the fact that he can't do his job.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.540]   And he told me this story.
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.620]   And I, you know, I feel like an idiot in hindsight
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.340]   because he's like, we have a guy who came in here.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.300]   I asked the guy, like, you know,
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.580]   why do you think this guy's Iranian?
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.220]   And he said, well, because he came through
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.340]   and he said that he was Mexican.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.020]   And I was like, well, couldn't he have been Mexican?
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.460]   And he said, well, he didn't speak Spanish.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.420]   I was like, oh, that's a tell.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.900]   You know, a guy from Mexico, an illegal alien,
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:21.700]   doesn't speak Spanish.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.620]   That's probably a pretty significant tell.
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:27.060]   But it's happening because this is what Kamala Harris
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:27.700]   has done.
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.420]   She's created this massive gap in our national security.
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.780]   And people are taking advantage of it.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.820]   It's really not that surprising.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.860]   - JD, let me just ask you one more foreign policy question
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.140]   on China.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.540]   So there's a balancing act with China.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.100]   But the rhetoric is, that's our enemy.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.300]   There's going to be a Cold War.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:47.860]   The structural relationship that the United States
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.780]   has with China is a very kind of codependent relationship.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:52.900]   They buy our bonds.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.020]   I guess they're selling them off now.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.980]   We buy a lot of product from them.
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.820]   It allows us to go into a Walmart
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.540]   and get, you know, $40 scooters for our kids
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.460]   or $20 scooters for our kids.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.940]   The technology industry is deeply dependent
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.940]   on a supply chain coming from China.
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.580]   There is a great commercial interdependency with China.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.620]   They have historically been a very important partner
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.780]   to the United States and our economic prosperity.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.340]   And I know the argument about hollowing out the middle class
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.460]   and so on because of moving everything offshore to China.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.900]   But how do we rip that bandaid off
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.020]   and not cause massive problems with inflation?
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.620]   How do we not, you know, drive the cost of everything up
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.180]   by tariffing things that are coming in from China?
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.820]   What's the way forward with China?
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:41.540]   Is it necessarily a deeply kind of divisive Cold War,
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.140]   or is there a path here that allows us
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.540]   to maintain a balanced trading relationship
[00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:49.460]   and kind of a peaceful transition with China
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.540]   as they continue to build up
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:54.580]   their kind of capabilities economically and with energy,
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.780]   which I think is one of the biggest drivers
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.500]   for their success.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.020]   - Well, so there's a lot there.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.180]   And let me try to sort of take a few pieces of it
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.620]   'cause I know we're relatively short on time.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.940]   So number one is the energy piece of it's very important.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.420]   Part of the way that you reshore American manufacturing
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.940]   is that you open up American energy.
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.340]   It matters for crypto, it matters for AI.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.260]   You've got to open up American energy
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.700]   or you're never going to have,
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.860]   whether it's the next generation of manufactured goods
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.060]   or the past generations,
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.420]   you've got to open up American energy.
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.620]   Okay, that's number one.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.180]   Number two is, look, I don't want to go to war with China.
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.940]   I think it would be hugely destructive,
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.940]   but I do think that we have to reshore
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.140]   more American manufacturing.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.060]   And one of the weird things about China,
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.980]   if you think about past eras of developing nations, right?
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.900]   So go back to like when the UK
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.660]   was the most advanced economy in the world
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.660]   and America was a developing nation.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:39.860]   Well, one of the things that happened
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.860]   is that like capital was flowing
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.580]   from the UK into the United States, right?
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.900]   From the developed into the developing nation.
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.660]   What's really weird about China
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.940]   is that it's like Americans borrow money
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.580]   from Chinese peasants to then buy the things
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.340]   that Chinese peasants are making for us, right?
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:59.220]   So it's not just the goods flow that's jacked up,
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.300]   it's the capital flows that are jacked up.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.220]   And I really think that the next,
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.580]   Donald Trump is going to be the next president
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.140]   of the United States.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.820]   And this is something we're going to have to figure out
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.020]   is that you need to balance
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.900]   both the capital and the goods flows, okay?
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.020]   I'm not saying we're going to have
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.020]   absolutely no trade with China,
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.580]   but right now the relationship is fundamentally
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:18.420]   that the Chinese have figured out
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:22.500]   they can create a massively powerful producerist society
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.180]   while America becomes a weaker,
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.020]   weaker consumerist society.
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.860]   That is the broken nature of the relationship.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.260]   And I think rebalancing is the right way to think about it,
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.300]   but we have got to do it.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.420]   And I think we're way, way behind.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.340]   - You, maybe final question,
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.700]   but you said something which I thought
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.860]   was incredibly well said, so I just want to repeat it.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:41.060]   When U.S. growth is one and 2%, everybody's fighting.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:41.460]   - Exactly.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.820]   - But when U.S. growth is 4% to 5%, everybody prospers.
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.300]   - Yeah.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.460]   - Can you walk us through just how you think about
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.340]   how we get that extra 200 or 300 basis points of growth
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.740]   and where you need to have less regulation
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.500]   so that you can have more entrepreneurship
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.580]   or more regulation to kind of constrain folks?
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:56.900]   How do you think?
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.580]   - And less regulation for that energy sector.
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.660]   - Yeah, I mean, I really do think
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:04.500]   that we have to recognize that we have massively
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.660]   over-regulated the real world, right?
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.460]   Over-regulated transportation, over-regulated energy,
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.140]   over-regulated home construction.
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.020]   I don't know that it's, I don't know how easy it is
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.940]   to get another 300 bps of growth,
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.860]   but I think you get a lot more growth,
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:22.020]   whether it's 300 or 150, just by massively reducing
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.740]   the amount of regulatory burden in the real economy.
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:26.340]   And again, I'm an optimist.
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.980]   I'm fundamentally an optimist on both, you know,
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:33.460]   crypto, blockchain, web three stuff, but also on AI.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:37.060]   And, you know, the way out of this may very well be
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.140]   to radically open up the way
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.620]   the technological innovation drives things
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.580]   in the United States.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.260]   And just on this point about China,
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.820]   I don't know how much time we have,
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.100]   but I'll try to be quick about this.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.980]   One of the things that Bob--
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:49.940]   - Whatever time you need.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:50.420]   - Okay.
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.380]   - It's more about you.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.020]   - All right.
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.340]   Well, I'm a politician, so buckle in.
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.300]   We're gonna be here for three hours.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.660]   (all laughing)
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:01.540]   But one of the real conceits of the 30 years
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.180]   of globalization that I think was really, really deranged,
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.860]   in hindsight, very wrong, Bob Lighthizer,
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.140]   who is Trump's trade representative,
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.620]   talks a lot about this is we had this conceit
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.340]   that we could separate the manufacturer of things
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.540]   from the design of things, right?
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.540]   So if you get an iPhone right now
[00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.660]   and you get it out of the box,
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.580]   you will see that it says designed
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.860]   in Cupertino, California.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.340]   Of course, the implication is that it's manufactured
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.580]   in Shenzhen or wherever they're manufacturing iPhones
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.540]   these days.
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.980]   The idea that the iPhone is designed in Cupertino
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.140]   is increasingly no longer even true, right?
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.900]   It's something that we lie to ourselves about
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.300]   because the people who are doing all the manufacturing
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.780]   of the hardware of the iPhone are getting much better
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.300]   at design and innovation.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.980]   And part of the reason why I care so much
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.260]   about this manufacturing thing
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.860]   is whether it's antibiotics, for example.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:47.620]   Why hasn't America invented an antibiotic in 30 years?
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.900]   It probably has something to do
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.340]   with the manufacture of antibiotics
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.860]   is done almost entirely
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.340]   in very low cost manufacturing areas.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.740]   You can go through a whole host of goods like this,
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.100]   but if you want to build a high tech,
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.580]   high dynamic growth economy,
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:06.260]   you have to have some native manufacturing
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.380]   and some self-reliance.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.780]   And so these two things are very related.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:10.820]   And I think it's a big part
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.660]   of getting back to four or 5% growth
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.980]   is accepting that, yes, we're going to have trade,
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.820]   but we can't let everybody make all of our stuff.
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.580]   - Sax, final question for you.
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:23.060]   - Yeah, well, I want to wrap this up
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.900]   because I think we're basically out of time
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.660]   by just observing that both Donald Trump
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.900]   and J.D. Vance have been on this podcast.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.860]   And it's not because I'm a crazy right winger.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.540]   It's because we invited them.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.180]   - It's not just because.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.140]   - Not just because.
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.460]   It's because we invited them and they accepted.
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.660]   We have similarly invited Kamala Harris
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.620]   and Tim Waltz to be on this.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.100]   - And Biden before that, but he forgot.
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:54.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.620]   - So we're still waiting.
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.980]   - He said yes, he forgot.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.940]   He lost the Zoom link.
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.580]   - So we want to re--
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.780]   - I'm not supposed to be on this call?
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.420]   - Yeah, we want to re-extend the invitation.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.860]   - Yes, to be very clear.
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.140]   - To both Kamala Harris and Tim Waltz.
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.380]   You're welcome to come on the podcast anytime.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.820]   And the format will be similar.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.660]   - Yeah, and I just want to say, J.D.,
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.660]   I think your answers were fantastic here today.
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.420]   And I really do appreciate you coming on
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.940]   and answering these questions.
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:20.980]   Very thoughtfully.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.220]   And, you know, from my perspective,
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.380]   when I heard that you were announced as the VP,
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.140]   I thought, well, this is great.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.180]   A young person who's got a lot of experience
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.220]   in venture capital and building things in the world.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.300]   And somebody who comes from humble beginnings
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.900]   like the four of us and believes that a meritocracy
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.140]   where people work hard and get reward for it.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.300]   So you check all my boxes in that way.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.980]   And I really think I feel much better.
[00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.060]   I, you know, I have my issues with your boss,
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:53.380]   but when you talk about, you know,
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.620]   the bite-size, you know, steps to it, you know,
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.260]   I think one framework to look at your relationship
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.860]   with Trump is he says things, you know,
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.180]   at the top of the, at the highest vibration,
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.540]   we're going to deport 20 million people.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.980]   And then you have a very practical approach.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.700]   60% tariffs makes no sense, but hey,
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.140]   we've got to rebalance this.
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.220]   And so I really do like your measured approach to this.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.220]   And I think that you're a great counterbalance.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.500]   And I think we understand why he picked you.
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:15.540]   - I want to say one thing.
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:22.980]   (audience applauding)
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.140]   And this is not really related to anything,
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.460]   except that you are not supposed to be here.
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.060]   - That's exactly right, yeah.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.020]   - And that is really inspiring to other people
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.220]   who are not supposed to be here.
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.180]   Thank you.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:34.580]   - Yeah.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:35.060]   (audience applauding)
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.900]   And if you haven't read J.D.'s book,
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.780]   I read your book long before all of this.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:39.940]   - Incredible.
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.020]   - And I just want to say your book was so inspiring
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:45.300]   and I have recommended it long before today
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.380]   to literally hundreds of people.
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:47.460]   - Let's read it.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.460]   - It's a fantastic read if you haven't read it.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.020]   - Yeah.
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:50.980]   - Well, and by the way,
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.500]   available wherever books are sold.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:54.980]   - You're like J.Cow.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:55.940]   - Exactly.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.100]   - Do you have an affiliate link?
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.460]   - 529 account for the kids.
[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.900]   - J.D. Vance dot com slash Jason.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.780]   - Can I just, just two things.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.660]   First of all, Jason, I appreciate what you said,
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.380]   but I also just want to defend my running mate here
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.980]   because I think that, again,
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.500]   the media doesn't often tell you the truth
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:13.300]   about Donald Trump.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.980]   Donald Trump cares more about the details
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.140]   of public policy than almost anyone
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:18.820]   I've ever met in public life.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:19.940]   That's actually real.
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.700]   He thinks about how this stuff affects
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.460]   the real economy and real Americans.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.220]   So if you're on the fence,
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.460]   whether you like what I said or dislike what I said,
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:30.260]   I just encourage you, listen to what he actually says
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.020]   because I think that you'll become a believer
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.740]   that he can make the country great again as he promises.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.620]   But separate from that, I just want to say,
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.340]   this is such an important conversation
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.140]   and you guys hold and host important conversations
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.020]   every single day.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.380]   We should do more of it as a country,
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:46.580]   but I'm glad to participate today.
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:47.460]   God bless everybody, thank you.
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.900]   - Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, Katie Vance.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:54.260]   (audience applauding)
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.060]   - That was great.
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.020]   - That was great.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:04.180]   (audience applauding)
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:14.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
