[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:40.240]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 32. What order should I use to pay off my debt? A rational
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.000]   approach to the debt snowball, the debt avalanche, the debt tsunami, and all of the other debt
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   and precipitation terms you can throw in.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:12.160]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast for today, Thursday, July 31, 2014. Today
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.240]   we're going to try to stir up the hornet's nest a little bit, try to give a little bit
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.480]   of information and some, what I think, rational ways of thinking and considering the details
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.120]   of how should I go about paying off my debt. I've decided to pay off my debt, but what
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:40.680]   order should I use to pay off those debts? This is one of the biggest, I don't know,
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.560]   if you pay attention to the personal finance world, you'll know this is an ongoing debate
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.560]   that everyone likes to argue about. If you don't pay attention to the personal finance
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.920]   world, this may be news to you that this is even a controversy of any sort. I often talk
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.880]   with people and I mention this controversy and they look at me with a blank stare like,
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.040]   "Why would anybody do that?" That being the other thing that someone else would say, "Why
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.080]   would anybody do this one?" It's rather comical to me just because everyone has this broad
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:20.320]   range of opinions. This is one of those things where sorting out right and wrong is challenging
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:30.240]   because it's personal. I think this is an excellent example to use to show how I think
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.840]   that we who are interested in finance, we who are interested in a rational approach,
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.640]   a rational and radical approach to finance, to personal finance, I think we have a responsibility
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.640]   to up our game in this area because there are literally millions of people that are
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.480]   depending upon us, those of us who are interested in this stuff, whether we're a financial advisor,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.640]   a financial blogger, just an average person who's interested in finance, all of us are
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.040]   going to have the ability to impact someone else's life when they ask us questions. I
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.200]   think we have a responsibility to help them and there are millions of people who need
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.840]   our help. It doesn't help to do this infighting, these arguments back and forth about debt
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.040]   snowball versus debt avalanche. If you're not familiar with those terms, give me a moment
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.080]   and I'll explain them to you. Today, I'd like to just give some thoughts and some ideas
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.720]   for how we could go a little bit deeper than just this back and forth argument. I believe
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.160]   this will be helpful. I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't believe it would be helpful.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.680]   But I believe there's another layer that we really need to talk about and we really need
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.000]   to understand all of the forces at work in this entire conversation. We need to go beyond
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.800]   should I pay off my debt in the highest balance first or should I pay off my debt in the highest
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.200]   interest rate first. If we can go beyond this argument, we can stop fighting among each
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.280]   other and start helping more people. Those of us who care about these topics, we're not
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.640]   the enemy. The debt is the enemy. The consumer debt is the enemy. So let's focus on that
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.520]   and let's clear the way for that.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.480]   So first I want to lay out the problem and just some of my assumptions for today's show.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.560]   In today's show, I'm not going to talk much about getting out of debt. But to be clear,
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.640]   I think getting out of debt is an incredibly important step on the path to financial independence
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.320]   and financial freedom. If I could help any young person avoid going into debt from the
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.880]   beginning, I would. If I could help any person get out of debt, I would. I don't want to
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.240]   provide any comments today on the topic of getting out of debt versus investing, although
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.160]   I have some pretty strong feelings on that as well. It's not as simple as one or the
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.400]   other. It's a very individualized decision.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.440]   But today I'm just going to assume we've decided we want to get out of debt and we've decided
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.100]   that this is our number one focus and this is our number one priority. There may be many
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.840]   reasons why this would be the ideal thing to approach and the ideal thing to do.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.200]   So let's talk about some different ways to do that. This may sound silly, but there are
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.720]   various debt reduction methodologies that you could use. I've thought of five of them
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.640]   to use in our conversation today.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.360]   The first one is what I call the minimum payment methodology. The idea behind a minimum payment
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.560]   methodology is you just simply pay your debts according to how much your creditors are charging
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.440]   you. So you take your statement every month and you take a look at it and whatever the
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.800]   payment, the minimum payment is that it says there on the statement, you pay that amount
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.480]   off. Now this can work brilliantly for some kinds of debts and this can be a disaster
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.120]   for other kinds of debts. So this can work brilliantly for what are called fully amortizing
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.680]   debts with level payments. So this may work well for a mortgage payment. We all know that
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.000]   if we have a mortgage payment and we have a traditional fixed rate mortgage payment
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.680]   with a level payment, we know that over time if we just pay that level payment that upon
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.180]   the term of the loan maturing, that that payment will be paid off. So if we took out a 30-year
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.160]   loan and we pay that level payment each month for 30 years, at the end of 360 months that
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.560]   payment will be paid off. Or if we have a car payment, then this car payment will be
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.640]   paid off under the terms of its loan. So if it's a 60-month loan, we know that 60 months
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.120]   later this car will be paid off and we'll have a level payment over that 60-month period.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.840]   The minimum payment methodology is a little bit more tricky when you get into the world
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.320]   of student loans and also when you get into the world of credit cards. The challenge is
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.360]   especially with credit cards of this payment methodology because as you pay the loan balance
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.760]   down, the minimum payment changes. And so with most credit cards, the way that the minimum
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.320]   payment is calculated is that if you start off with a $10,000 balance and that balance
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.280]   declines, then the minimum payment will be recalculated. So under a credit card minimum
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.880]   payment methodology, you'll wind up paying a substantial amount of interest if you just
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.280]   pay the minimum payments. Student loans vary depending on the nature of the loan and there
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.160]   are some funky things with student loans that I don't want to get into today as far as the
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.960]   various repayment options and various forgiveness options and things like that, various terms
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.480]   where the payments are not due and then the payment calculation being based upon income.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.520]   So a little bit funky. Just look and read the terms of your loan for that. So the minimum
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:28.680]   payment methodology is frankly what many debtors wind up doing. That's what many debtors wind
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.200]   up doing because if you're a debtor and you just pay the minimum amount that you need
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.760]   to do and those minimum amounts can accrue and accumulate over time. And the challenge
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.280]   is that's usually going to be the slowest way to pay it off. Now many people who are
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.600]   in debt do want to pay off their debt more quickly and get things cleared a little bit
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.080]   faster. And so then that brings us to debt reduction methodology number two, which I
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.640]   call a little extra here and there. And so this would be I pay a little extra here, I
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.000]   pay a little extra there. I'm putting a little $50 extra on this credit card. I'm putting
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.400]   $50 extra on that student loan and I'm just kind of paying a little bit more as I have
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.680]   the opportunity to pay a little bit more. This is frankly quite normal. This is what
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:15.080]   many people do. And this is why those who have ongoing balances of their debt payments,
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.200]   ongoing balances on their debts, they often don't feel like they make much progress because
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.560]   the energy is spread out. And so I agree 100% with the various personal finance gurus and
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.080]   pundits that comment on this topic. It makes all the sense in the world to me. This is
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:36.280]   probably the least effective way of paying off debt because $50 here, $200 there, $1,000
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.440]   on the other debt makes you feel like you're never making measurable progress because you
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:46.080]   don't have a plan. And so this is probably the least effective. And I would encourage
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:52.240]   nobody to follow this one. I would encourage anybody to pick one of the other methodologies.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:59.000]   So then we move on to kind of the other methodologies that are more proclaimed. I'm familiar with
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.400]   three or four depending on how you count them. There's two biggies and then there's one or
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.400]   maybe the same thing, two that I've heard of here and there in paying attention to personal
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.280]   finance stuff over the years. The two biggies are what are called the debt snowball and
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.840]   the debt avalanche. And then the other two is the debt tsunami and the risk reduction
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:22.200]   method. Those are just some various names that I have heard for paying off debts. And
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.160]   I'll explain them one by one. So the biggie in the personal finance space is the idea
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.880]   of the debt snowball. All four of these, by the way, are trying to harness the same focus
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:39.600]   methodology. And so the idea here is that with any one of these payment methodologies,
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:45.320]   the idea is that you will pay a minimum payment on all of your debts except one. And you will
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:50.680]   pick one balance, one debt to which you're going to focus all of your extra payments
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:57.240]   over and above and beyond the minimum payment that's required. And then by focusing on that
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.840]   payment, on that debt, you will clear that debt and then you'll take the amount of money
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.760]   that you were paying towards that debt and then you'll roll it towards the second debt
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.480]   on your list, whichever that second debt happens to be. And then you'll move on to the third
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.040]   debt, then on to the fourth debt, then on to the fifth debt. Now this is extremely powerful
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.600]   as a debt payment methodology because instead of just simply paying the minimum payments
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.440]   and then when one debt is cleared, you continue paying minimum payments on the others, by
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.280]   focusing the efforts on one and then rolling the payment that was being paid towards that
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.120]   one once the first one is paid off to the second one, then the amount that you're paying
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:40.600]   each month towards the debt grows substantially over time. And so this is really powerful
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.800]   because it focuses your efforts. And then by focusing the efforts onto one specific
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.840]   debt, by focusing on one specific debt, then it concentrates you and gives you the power
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.000]   of, basically the power of focus. I think there was a book written with that name. It's
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.040]   the power of focus. Basically anything we focus on, we're able to make substantial progress
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.560]   on and it's no different in the area of debt repayment. So I want to walk through these
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:09.480]   different methods. So the most popular of these four is called the debt snowball. And
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.480]   the reason it's the most popular is because this is the method championed by the big,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.880]   the big dog in the personal finance space, Dave Ramsey. And so Dave Ramsey champions
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.920]   a method that he calls the debt snowball. And I assume he didn't make up the name. I
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.760]   assume he just popularized it. But if he did, I give him all the credit. I don't know where
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:34.840]   these names came from. And the idea behind the debt snowball is to pay minimum payments
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:41.040]   on all of the debts except the one with the smallest balance. So if you have a -- you
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.520]   have three loans and one of them has a $1,000 balance, one of them has a $10,000 balance,
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.360]   and one of them has a $5,000 balance, you ignore the interest rates and you focus on
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.320]   the one with the smallest balance. And the idea here is to harness the power of behavioral
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:02.680]   modification and set yourself up for a feeling of success by getting a win of paying off
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:11.360]   the debt quickly. So the analogy that Dave will use and that I think is accurate is anything
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.960]   that you start, for example, dieting, if you focus on what can I do in the first -- what
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.760]   can I do up front and what can I do -- if you go on a diet and you lose five or ten
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.640]   pounds really quickly, your more -- idea is that you're more motivated to stick with your
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.200]   diet. So the same thing. If you can -- if you have a list of five debts and you have
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.640]   two little ones and you can get that little -- the first little one cleared out in the
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.320]   first month and the second little one cleared out in the second and third month, then this
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:42.240]   is a really powerful motivating factor to help you stay on the plan. So now you've gone
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:48.040]   from five debts to three debts and you get some wins of not having to face those bills
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.960]   and those debt statements in the month -- in the mail every month. The critics of this
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.480]   methodology will quickly complain, well, what about the interest rates? And, you know, if
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.840]   you're paying off the debt that has the smallest balance, it may also have the lowest interest
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.480]   rate, so therefore the interest rate -- the higher interest rates on the other debts are
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.280]   continuing to accrue and you're paying more money. And I'll go into this in detail because
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.760]   that's the point of today's show. We're going to do some number crunching and show when
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.320]   this matters and when this doesn't matter. So that's what the critics would say is that
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.680]   you're paying more money in interest and then the defense for this method would be, well,
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.200]   yes, you're paying more money in interest, but you're harnessing the power of behavior
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.280]   modification. So that's the debt snowball. The next method of paying off debt would be
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.360]   what I would call -- or what is commonly called the debt avalanche. And so the debt avalanche
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.840]   is to list all your debts in order of the highest interest rate to the lowest interest
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:47.600]   rate and put all of your focus onto the payment that has the highest interest rate. By doing
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.600]   this, you're wiping out the interest payments and this will ultimately be the least expensive
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.400]   way to pay off the debts. Now, the critics of this method will say, well, yeah, it would
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.120]   be the least expensive way if you're able to stay motivated. But if you're not able
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.600]   to stay motivated, then you're not going to pay off your debt. You're not going to pay
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.160]   off your debt. So you're just going to sit there and be trucking away at this. Maybe
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.960]   you have a big debt with a high interest rate and you're just going to be sitting here trucking
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:17.960]   away at the amounts and you're not going to make any progress on it. But the defendants
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:23.840]   of this methodology would say, well, it's still going to be the cheapest, so it's going
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.640]   to be the fastest and you're going to pay the least money out of pocket. Now, the other
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.280]   two are not -- so those are the two big ones, the debt snowball and the debt avalanche.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.680]   And the other two are ones that I've just heard here and there. The debt tsunami, I've
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:42.520]   only ever heard this written by -- I heard this term, I think it was coined by Adam Baker,
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:48.720]   who wrote a blog called "Man vs. Debt." And his idea here with his debt tsunami was to
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.960]   focus on the most hated debt. And his idea was, why don't you harness the power of behavior
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.640]   modification by focusing on the debt that you hate the most? So, for example, if you
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:06.840]   have -- if you owe a credit card balance that is for an ex-spouse's spending prior to a
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.440]   divorce, and if you hate that balance, get rid of that first. Or if you owe a credit
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.640]   card balance and you just hate Bank of America for some reason, well, pay off that Bank of
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.920]   America card first. And so, his idea was harness the power of behavior modification by focusing
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.040]   on the most hated debt. And then, the other is similar, and this is the least popular
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.760]   that I've heard, but I've seen it in a couple of articles, basically the risk reduction
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.760]   method, which is the idea is you pick the riskiest debt to you. And so, this is similar
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:42.960]   to the most hated debt. And so, the idea is, well, figure out what your riskiest debt is.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.760]   If it's a debt to your parents or a debt to -- on a mortgage that you want to make sure
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:53.000]   your house is paid off so you don't lose the house if you face difficult times, things
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.680]   like that. So, these are the different methodologies. And I'm going to -- we're going to do some
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.640]   math today, and I think I've got it simplified enough to be able to do it on a podcast. We're
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.520]   going to do some math, because here's my issue with all of these things, and I'm going to
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:13.320]   scream it loud and clear. This must be an individual discussion, because there are two
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.040]   things that are important. Number one is it's important to look at the individual's makeup
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:23.000]   of their individual debt. And number two, there's a whole realm that we're not talking
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.680]   about, which is the terms of the debt. And so, most of the time, people are always talking
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.400]   about what debt balance should I pay off and what interest rate balance should I pay off,
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.800]   but they forget about what are the terms of the debt. And the terms of the debt matter.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:41.040]   And so, we're going to talk extensively about the terms towards the end of the show today,
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.400]   because I think we need to factor this in. Now, before we do, many people's -- I want
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.600]   to just give a disclaimer. Many people's debt situations are very simple. If you listen
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.840]   to Dave Ramsey's show, you listen to his radio show, the people that are calling in, this
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:02.240]   is the -- this is kind of the average American, low to middle income, struggling with debt,
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.800]   and the debt makeup is fairly simple. So, it's I've got a credit card, I've got a student
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.440]   loan, and I've got a car payment. And so, if you've got a credit card, a student loan,
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.480]   and a car payment, it may be fairly straightforward as far as which of those you should pay off.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.680]   And so, I'm not mad about these methodologies, but the problem is that when we fight about
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:25.440]   them, we're missing the bigger picture, what's actually important. And so, we need to actually
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:31.960]   personalize this with people. We need to actually run a personal spreadsheet for each makeup
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:37.720]   of a debt -- makeup of somebody's balances. This is important. So, I'm going to pass along
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   a tool in a moment, and it's the easiest tool I've found. It's totally free, and I'd encourage
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.760]   you to use it if you're trying to figure out what your -- what plan you should use for
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.840]   your debt, or if you're trying to help somebody else, whether that's a client, if you're a
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.360]   financial planner, or whether it's just a friend or a family member, if you're trying
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.640]   to help somebody else figure out what they should do as far as how they should focus
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:05.960]   on paying off their debts. The key thing in all of these plans is to understand basically
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:12.120]   what's the alternative use of the dollar. And so, the whole concept of paying off the
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:18.920]   -- of debts is that we're going to transition from consumption of money over to the paying
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.520]   off of debt, which is usually going to be consumer debt, which was previous consumption.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.800]   And this is what many people who are deeply in debt or want to get out are going to do.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.680]   And so, if you're -- if you are -- if you have a lot of debt, and you have a lot of
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.240]   consumer debt, and you're going to transition, and you're going to change dollars that you're
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.560]   currently spending, because you made your cash flow statement, and you're going to move
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.920]   some of the dollars that you're spending on consumption over to paying off your debts,
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.600]   then that's awesome. That's going to be a good move. But if the majority of your cash
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.680]   flow is going toward investment, and you're carrying debt for -- and you're carrying debt
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.200]   for investment purposes, then this is a very different conversation. And so, that's why
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.720]   in the future we will do some should I pay off debt or invest shows. But look at your
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.080]   cash flow statement. See where your money's going. Now, again, with the majority of people,
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.000]   at least in my experience, it seems fairly simple. We're going to allocate money over
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.160]   from consumption, from the consumption categories over to the debt repayment categories. And
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.280]   that's definitely going to be a good move. It's going to be very difficult for that not
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.840]   to be a good move. So, let's assume that's the case. Now, I've
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:27.320]   run some numbers, and I'm going to walk through those numbers to show you how this does matter.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.000]   And for the sake of -- I don't -- it's hard to get too numbers intensive in a podcast,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.120]   but I think I've been able to simplify it enough to make the point. And so, what I've
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.600]   done -- and you'll see why I've done this in a moment. But I've simplified, and I'm
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.040]   using a spreadsheet here that is a debt reduction calculator. And there will be a link in the
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.820]   show notes. This is the most useful spreadsheet that I have ever found that someone has created.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.200]   It's for free. You can buy it. There will be a link in the show -- excuse me. It's for
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.360]   free. You can use it and download it from the link in the show notes. It is published
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:05.360]   on a website called Vertex 42, where they publish a lot of Excel templates and Excel
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.160]   -- basically Excel templates. And this is a calculator that someone has created that
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:16.000]   is a fabulous, fabulous calculator. And you can download it for free, and you can enter
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.280]   up to 10 debts, or you can pay for a version which you can enter more debts. It's 10 bucks
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.840]   if you need to list more than 10 creditors. So you can list up to -- you can have a list
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:33.840]   up to 20 creditors, or even as much to -- yeah, as much as 20 creditors. And this is fabulous,
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.200]   because instead of our sitting around arguing about what -- you know, what's right and what's
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.400]   wrong, we can calculate it. And we can calculate what our cost would be. So if we're going
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:49.640]   to do the method focusing on behavior modification, the debt snowball, we can calculate what the
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.680]   actual cost of the additional interest that we're paying would be. And I've done these
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.600]   calculations a lot of times with clients. I've done many of these calculations, and
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:04.500]   I've found that it's very important to do the individual calculation with a client,
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.580]   because the makeup of the debts and the terms of the debts matters. The interest rates matter
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:16.580]   and the amounts matter. So just to lay out a very extreme example to make my point, if
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:23.000]   you have three debts, one of them has a $20,000 balance, one of them has a $300 balance, and
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.200]   one of them has an $800 balance, and you're going to throw an extra $1,000 a month at
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.720]   your debt payments, I think it would be pretty smart to just go ahead and use the debt snowball
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.240]   regardless of the interest rates. Just ignore the interest rates, because, you know, in
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.720]   a month and a half, you've got your two little debts cleared. But if you have three
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:45.880]   debts of relatively similar balances, then it's a very different situation. So you
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.100]   can't just say one or the other. You've got to look at what's the actual makeup
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.020]   of your debt, and you need to look at the interest rates and the terms. So I've got
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.320]   a spreadsheet here, and let me tell you what the debts are that I've entered into it.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:03.180]   And again, I'm using this -- I've simplified this to try to get this point across on audio.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.540]   But I'm using three debts. I'm using credit card debt, a car loan, and student loans.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:12.620]   So I've got credit cards, car loans, and student loans. And for the sake of illustration,
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:17.140]   I've chosen to make the one with the highest balance have the highest interest rate, and
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.640]   the one with the lowest balance have the lowest interest rate. And I've made these numbers
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:26.020]   up for the sake of illustration to show that -- first of all, these are reasonable numbers,
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:30.960]   but to show how this could really make a difference. And I would encourage you, follow the link
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:36.380]   in the show notes. Today's show notes are at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/32, and construct
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:41.580]   this for yourself. But let me use my example to show the difference. So I've got a $20,000
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:47.460]   credit card balance with an interest rate of 18% and a monthly payment of $500. I've
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:53.700]   got a $15,000 car loan with an interest rate of 8% and a monthly payment of $300. And I've
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.620]   got a student loan balance of $10,000 and an interest rate of 6% and a minimum monthly
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:05.820]   payment of $100. So my total minimum monthly payments are $900. And the way this spreadsheet
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:11.260]   works is because I have my minimum payment, it has to be paid of $900. But then I can
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:16.100]   choose to put in what is my extra payment. So what additional amount can I pay every
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:22.100]   month? Now, if I don't pay any additional amount, and I just pay these debts off on
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.740]   their -- and I just pay these debts off, but I pay a level $900, I'm still going to be
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:31.780]   out of debt faster. By the way, one disclaimer, I'm going to round some of these numbers to
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:37.060]   hopefully make them easier to hear on the podcast. So if there's a -- if it's $768,
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:42.260]   I'll just say $800. So I'm going to round a little bit to make the points. But you can
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.380]   again, you can calculate these out exactly to the dollar if you want to. So if you just
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:53.060]   pay the $900 payment every month, then you'll pay that for the first 62 months. And then
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:57.420]   after 62 months, the first two payments will be paid off. And then the full balance of
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:02.460]   the $900 will be moved over to the third payment. And it'll take a total of 69 months to pay
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:09.140]   off these debts under the terms that I have put them in here. So 69 months to take care
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.020]   of this. So that's just under six years to pay off the debt. Now, if you increase your
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.940]   monthly payment -- and so let's start with the monthly payment of $1,000 a month. If
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:21.580]   you put $1,000 a month in here, then it shortens things out. So let's start with an avalanche
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.420]   method. An avalanche of the highest interest rate -- let's start with the snowball method
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:30.140]   actually, which would be the lowest balance first. So if you're paying a snowball payment
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:36.420]   of $1,000 a month, so it's an extra $100 on top of the $900 of initial minimum monthly
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:40.420]   payments, the first debt would be paid off. That would be the student loan, starting with
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:45.060]   the $10,000 balance. That would be paid off in 58 months. And you would pay a total of
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:51.500]   $11,536 of interest. Then the car loan would be paid off at 60 months. So that would be
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:56.860]   -- you'd pay off the $15,000 balance and pay a total of $3,300 of interest. And then the
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:02.540]   credit cards would be paid off in 61 months. And you would pay off the balance of $20,000,
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:12.580]   and you would pay a total interest of $10,765. So the total interest paid would be $15,604.53.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:18.500]   Now if you switch this and you say, "Okay, so I'm paying $15,600 of interest under the
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:24.540]   snowball method. What if I take exactly the same terms and I make it -- I'm going to continue
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:30.220]   to pay $1,000 a month, but I go ahead and put it at the highest interest rate first?"
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:35.060]   Well now I'm going to pay the credit cards first. And I'm going to have that paid off
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:40.300]   in 47 months, and then the car loan's in 52, then the student loan's in 59. My total interest
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:51.180]   paid would be $13,462. So you would pay a lower interest rate, $13,462. So if you subtract
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:59.660]   -- I'll just do $13,460 from $15,600, you can see that under the snowball method, you
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:06.940]   would pay an additional $2,000 of interest. So the snowball method is $2,000 of interest
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.900]   payments, more expensive. And then the amount of time that it would take to pay off these
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:17.260]   debts, if you looked at it, it would be a total of 59 months under the snowball method
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:22.540]   and a total of -- let's see here -- 61 months -- excuse me -- a total of 59 months under
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.820]   the avalanche method, so highest interest rate first, and a total of 61 months under
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:32.020]   the snowball method. So under this scenario, if you were working on this plan, you would
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:38.140]   say, "Well, there's not that -- I mean, to me, when the first debt is paid off in 58
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:44.780]   months under the snowball method, and then the avalanche method, the first one has paid
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:50.020]   off -- the debt has paid off in 47 months, then here the clear winner would be to do
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:55.700]   the avalanche under this scenario." Now, I want to be fair to Dave Ramsey. This is not
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:01.940]   his method. Dave Ramsey's method, if you listen to his show and absorb what he says, his method
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:08.220]   is you should have a target payoff of being able to pay off your debts in basically around
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.380]   two years -- one year, two years, three years. And his goal for doing that, what he would
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:19.180]   say is sell the car, get rid of that $15,000. Now you've dropped your balance from -- total
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:24.060]   balance is from $45,000 to $30,000, and then sell a bunch of other stuff and just make
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:28.660]   sure that you're on a plan, get an extra job, make sure you're on a plan to get things paid
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:35.100]   off in about two to three years. So that would be his plan. So let's figure out what would
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.140]   be the cost under this scenario if we did it that way. So I'm going to up my monthly
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.900]   payment, and let's just see how -- I'm going to keep my strategy under the snowball, and
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:48.820]   I'm going to up my monthly payment to $2,000. Well, now if I up my monthly payment to $2,000,
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:54.300]   which would be $1,100 higher than my minimum payments of $900, now under the snowball method,
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:28:00.460]   I can pay off my debts in 27 months. It would be the longest one paid off, 27 months. So
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.940]   I'm paying them off, and my total interest at $2,000 -- if I can make $2,000 level payments
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:11.700]   towards my $45,000 debt, in 27 months I will have paid off all of the debts, and I'll pay
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:19.540]   a total of $7,494.42 of interest under the snowball method. If I do it under the avalanche
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:32.180]   method, then my total interest payments would be $4,986.27. So again, that interest savings
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:40.340]   that I would enjoy by paying this in the highest interest rate first, I would save $2,508 of
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.760]   interest. Well, let's look under this scenario. Let's look and see if I would be able to harness
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:51.260]   the power of the big wins, the quick wins. Under the avalanche method, I would have my
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:55.620]   first debt paid off in 14 months, and under the snowball method, I would have my first
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:59.660]   debt paid off in 9 months. So I would look at that, and I would say, "Am I going to be
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:04.860]   extra motivated by having that student loan payment paid off, $10,000, and have that paid
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:10.500]   off in 9 months, or am I still going to be motivated to do this for 14 months?" But under
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:16.900]   the avalanche method, I have my full debt paid off in 25 months versus 27 months. So
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:21.740]   I got five months. I had my first debt paid off five months sooner, but it took me two
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:27.820]   months longer under this scenario. So which was better for me? Now again, I want to be
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:34.620]   fair about this. I have constructed this chart using three loans, and I've made my highest
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:39.580]   credit card balance have the highest interest rate. Then my medium-sized car loan, $15,000,
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:44.540]   have an 8% interest rate, and then my student loans have $10,000 balance, have a 6% interest
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:50.060]   rate. So I don't think I'm constructing a straw man here. I think this is an accurate
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:54.900]   analysis, but I have tilted the odds in the favor of this math to illustrate how the math
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:30:00.900]   would work. So this would be the Dave Ramsey plan, because I am paying $2,000, and I have
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:07.500]   my debts paid off in 27 months. So this would be under the snowball. But to me, this would
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:11.620]   be a good example. If this were the scenario that someone were facing, this would be a
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:18.260]   good example where I would say, "Save the $2,500 of interest and make sure that you
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:23.020]   pay off the credit cards first, because 14 months versus nine months, is that really
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:28.100]   going to make a difference?" Now, again, if somebody had a $300 debt, well, yeah, get
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:34.220]   rid of the $300 debt. That would make a lot of sense to me. But this is why it's so difficult
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:40.620]   to -- why we have these stupid arguments in the finance world, when they can be quickly
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.820]   -- like, we have these stupid arguments about what's better, and you go and you read these
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.500]   comment threads of thousands of comments. Well, this method worked for me. It's great
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.820]   that it worked for you, but sit down and calculate it. Use the spreadsheet and calculate your
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:57.940]   method and figure out what it is for yourself. You're an adult. You can sit down, and you
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:03.620]   can say, "I think that I need some behavior modification." Let me give an example. It
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:07.820]   is not stupid, if you're going to go on a diet, to go around your house and say, "I'm
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.860]   going to throw out all the junk food out of my house, so that I don't have it sitting
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:18.240]   there and facing me." It's not stupid. You don't have to say, "I'm supposed to be this
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.400]   mature adult who doesn't give into temptation." I think that'd be pretty smart. Recognize
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:30.140]   these behavioral cues and recognize your situation. So understand it, and then harness the power
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:36.420]   of behavior modification. You don't have to go through these things. You can harness the
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:41.700]   power of behavior modification for yourself. So don't run from it. Don't just say, "I've
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.740]   got to be coldly rational." We're not coldly rational people. We're human beings. We're
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:51.180]   emotional human beings. But run the spreadsheet and actually do the math and figure out what
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:57.940]   your actual better scenario would be. So this would just be an example of snowball versus
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:04.260]   avalanche. Now, if I change something, I could change any of these variables and adjust the
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.740]   interest rate. In fact, I thought about doing that, but I think actually it would just be
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:13.140]   two numbers heavy for me to go through. I thought about making some alternative spreadsheets
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:18.140]   of different scenarios and showing how these things vary. But the key, I would just say,
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.900]   is do your own math. And I don't want to belabor the point. I think you get it. Do your own
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:29.740]   math. Interest rates do matter. Like it or not, interest rates do matter. You can't just
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.940]   say it's all about behavior modification and it's all about--and it's--and ignore the interest
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:39.140]   rates. Oh, I guess you could say whatever you want. I think it's dumb to say it's all
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:43.100]   about behavior modification and interest rates don't matter. And I think it's equally dumb
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:48.620]   to say it's all about interest rates and behavior modification doesn't matter. Both of these
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:54.060]   are important. So we've got to integrate these into the plan. And remember, just because
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:58.140]   something worked for you doesn't mean it's necessarily the same thing that everyone else
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:03.340]   should do. It's okay if something worked for you. It's okay for me to say, "I choose to
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:09.860]   do this because this aligns with my goals." And it's okay for you to say, "I have different
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:14.180]   goals." So just recognize, you know, we're all adults. We have one life to live. Let's
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.180]   live it and not worry about trying to make everyone else. Just because something worked
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:22.780]   for us doesn't mean that's what everyone else should do. If I sound a little bit passionate,
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:29.260]   it's because I am. Because I labored under this kind of construct for years of just this
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:33.180]   personal finance dogma, "This is the right way. This is the right way." Someday I'll
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:36.540]   tell my story on a show. But I mean, Dave Ramsey was a huge influence in my life. I
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:42.180]   got out of debt because I read his book, Total Money Makeover. And man, it was a brilliant
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:46.540]   behavior modification book for me. And I owe him a debt of gratitude for that. I would
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:51.100]   love to -- I've never met him. I would love to shake his hand and just say, "Thank you."
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.300]   That's awesome. But the problem is that it was totally destructive for me to take and
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:00.060]   apply that same thing to everything else, that same thing that worked for me in the
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:04.580]   financial planning world. And it took me years to learn, "Wait a second. I've got to be a
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:12.740]   little bit -- I've got to have a little bit more finesse with this." And then I just -- the
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:20.740]   dogma is not necessary. We've got to find a way to implement the -- to bring in the
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:28.020]   reality of behavior modification and inspiration without this like divisive, "This is the only
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.020]   right way." Why don't we teach -- that's what I'm trying to do. Why don't we teach people
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:36.060]   to think about it and be adults and think about and create your own plan instead of
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:39.340]   saying, "This is what you've got to do because this is right." Run the math. We ought to
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:45.460]   run the math on every single situation. And yes, we are doing math. And yes, personal
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:51.020]   finance is about finance. It's also about personal behavior and we -- but we are doing
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:35:00.460]   math. This does matter. So I want to go on and hopefully that's not too -- hopefully
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:06.420]   that's not too -- I'm not bitter. It's just -- the answer is every -- the answer in every
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.980]   situation will reveal itself when you actually sit down and create a spreadsheet or get out
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:17.380]   a calculator and calculate it. And this is the weakness is that a lot of times as financial
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:21.500]   people who are interested in finance, we're not taking the time to learn how to calculate
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:27.420]   this stuff. And so we spout what we've heard other people say that makes sense without
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.780]   sitting down and saying, "Let me challenge it." And if we would challenge people, you
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.180]   know, don't ever take -- if I do a financial plan for you, don't ever just take it at face
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.740]   value. Challenge it. You need to understand what's going on in it and I need to be able
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:42.260]   to defend it. And if we would learn to challenge things instead of just simply saying, "My
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:48.660]   guru says such and such," we may have a slightly better situation. We may have better teachers
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.540]   because we hold them accountable. We may hold our politicians accountable instead of lying
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:57.100]   every day and saying what they're doing and then they just do something else. And we may
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:02.160]   actually have a better situation if we would increase our knowledge a little bit and increase
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:07.300]   our capacity and our ability. And in a world where with a quick Google search we can turn
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:11.620]   up a spreadsheet then we just enter everything in and say, "Let me calculate it," this would
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:18.260]   be an amazingly -- this is a valuable thing to do. So let's calculate it. Moving on. Terms.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:25.140]   Interest rates matter. Amounts matter. But terms matter. So in my simplified example,
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:30.300]   I have a credit card, a car loan, and a student loan. But here's where you have to kind of
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:35.320]   look and say, "What are the actual terms of these debts?" And I cry sometimes when I see
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:42.920]   people make serious errors in paying off their debts. Serious errors. So remember, I said
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:48.820]   that this -- the whole debt conversation is predicated upon the idea of what's the alternative
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.460]   use of the dollar and the alternative use of the dollar being consumption. So yes, if
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:56.020]   you're going between consumption versus debt payments, you're probably better off paying
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.960]   off the debts. But what if this is not the question? What if the alternative use of the
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:04.200]   dollar is not consumption? What if the alternative use of the dollar is investment? Well, now
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.760]   we got to look at the terms of the debts and factor this in and we need to do a slightly
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:15.880]   more rational analysis. And so this is where -- I mean, this is what in my experience rich
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.280]   people do. You need to think about this. So let me give you some ideas that generally
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:24.040]   are not talked about. First of all, don't just look at the interest rate. Look at the
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:32.320]   fact of is the interest deductible or not? Deductibility matters. Deductibility matters.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.120]   Now, you may or may not be deducting it. So for example, home mortgage interest deduction,
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.840]   you may indeed be taking a standard deduction on your taxes and not deducting your home
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:44.840]   mortgage interest. However, that's not the only thing that's deductible. Are you deducting
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:50.320]   your student loan interest? Are you deducting this as a business interest? First of all,
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.520]   don't be dumb and ever borrow money that's not deductible. And I say it again, don't
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:59.160]   be dumb and ever borrow money that's not deductible. Listen to my show and I'll teach you all the
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:05.480]   ways to borrow money that's deductible, but don't ever -- this is why the gap between
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:09.600]   the rich and the poor gets bigger, is that poor people borrow for consumptions. They
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.360]   borrow on a credit card at a high interest rate and it's non-deductible interest. They
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.880]   borrow on a car and it's a high interest rate and it's non-deductible interest. And they
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:23.640]   borrow on a house, but their income is such and the house is so low as far as the amount
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.800]   of interest that they're paying on the house payment, that they're better off just taking
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:31.360]   the standard deduction. They'd be better off just renting probably, most of the time. And
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.960]   so you're wasting this deduction. So -- but wealthy people would say, well, let me make
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.280]   sure that I'm borrowing and if I'm borrowing it's going to be on a business credit card,
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.120]   so therefore my interest would be deductible. If I'm borrowing and paying interest on a
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:49.040]   car loan, let me make sure that at least some portion of that car loan is being paid by
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.080]   business, so that it's deductible. And let me make sure that my home mortgage, if I'm
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.640]   going to go ahead and do that out, let me make sure that I go ahead and maximize that
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:01.560]   deduction. So I don't think it's -- I wouldn't -- I don't think it's smart to go into debt
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.440]   for the purpose of deduction, but if you're going to go into debt, make sure that you're
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:10.240]   going to deduct it. And don't -- and let -- and this stuff matters. And this is a major, major
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:17.240]   factor in financial planning. You've got to look at the deductibility of the interest.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:23.760]   Now, give me an example, okay? The mortgage is the simple one. If you are deducting your
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:28.200]   mortgage, you would run the analysis. If you are deducting your mortgage interest, you
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.840]   would run the analysis and see, you know, for example, are you close to the standard
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.480]   deduction line? If you're close to the standard deduction, you can just use the standard deduction
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:40.120]   instead of itemizing your deductions, that would be fine. You may choose to go ahead
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:46.960]   and pay off the mortgage. But you may, if you're in a higher tax bracket, there's no
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:53.120]   question of the fact that if you can subsidize -- let the tax code subsidize your mortgage
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:58.920]   interest, that can be a substantial savings. If you're in a marginal bracket of 25, 28,
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:07.200]   30-something percent, then the -- a 30 percent discount on your interest can be a substantial
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.360]   interest deduction. If you go from 4 percent, that drops you down to 3 percent. That's a
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:17.520]   substantial savings as far as allowing the tax code to subsidize you. What about something
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:22.600]   like if you're going to borrow money for a business -- if you're going to borrow money
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.080]   on a car and you do that in your business versus not? Let's say that you're self-employed.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.520]   Look at the savings that you have with the deductibility of business interest versus
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:38.720]   not. Let's say that you have purchased a car and your interest rate is 5 percent on your
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.880]   loan. Hopefully you got good credit and you can get it much lower than that. But let's
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:47.240]   just say 5 percent for an easy example. If you're in a marginal bracket -- I'm just going
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:52.120]   to use 28 percent. Let's say you're in a 28 percent marginal bracket and you're self-employed.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:58.160]   So you're also paying -- I'll just use self-employment taxes instead of employment taxes because
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.800]   they're just simpler. So you're paying 15.3 percent of self-employment taxes. So your
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:12.680]   savings on that loan is 15.3 percent plus 28. So you have a 43 percent discount on that
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:18.360]   interest rate because of the fact that you are able to deduct the interest. So if your
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:23.120]   interest rate were 5 percent, then you would lower that by 43 percent and that's what your
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:30.480]   effective interest rate is. That's a substantial discount. You've got to factor that in because
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:35.320]   when you can get a 43 percent savings on your interest rate and if you can borrow money
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:40.840]   under reasonable terms, you've got to factor that in. That does matter. So you've got to
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.720]   look at that. And let's say under this scenario -- and here's why I bring it in in the debt
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.800]   scenario. In this scenario, if you're advising a client, if you're a financial planner, or
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:55.520]   if you're just advising -- you're just coaching yourself, if you have an asset that has a
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:01.640]   loan on it under the business loan and you have personal debt, then this is going to
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:09.960]   dramatically affect your specific debt payoff plan. And you better prioritize that -- I
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:16.920]   would recommend that you prioritize that personal debt over and above the business debt and
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:22.480]   continue to enjoy the subsidy on your business debt. It exists for a reason. Remember, Congress
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:27.480]   -- all this stuff exists for a reason. You're supposed to be being incentivized to go out
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.640]   and borrow money to expand your business. So why not take advantage of that? Now, you
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:36.720]   may still want to pay off that debt. If you get to the point where you say -- again, I'm
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.080]   not arguing today what debts you should pay off and shouldn't pay off. I'm just arguing
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:45.560]   about the order. And that if somebody has -- if you're doing this snowball thing where
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:51.760]   you've got -- I've got a car loan in my business over here that is a small amount. I've got
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:59.880]   to put that first. No. Focus on the deductibility of the debt versus the non-deductibility.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.120]   Focus on the actual makeup of the interest. So, for example, is this fixed interest or
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:12.020]   not? So take a look and figure out what you should actually choose to do under the interest.
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:16.320]   So is the interest rate fixed or is it not? And depending on what the makeup is of your
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:21.640]   debt, you may have different options. I would heartily suggest if you can ever refinance,
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:26.520]   always look to refinance your debt. Now, again, you need to do the math to make sure that
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.320]   it's in your best interest. So if there's a cost to refinancing the debt at a lower
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:35.320]   rate -- so, for example, let's say that you're surfing credit card balances and they say
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.920]   we'll allow you to do a balance transfer to a lower interest rate, but we're going to
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:44.300]   charge you a percentage of the balance. Because you're actually doing math and not just blindly
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:53.080]   following someone else's plan, look at your spreadsheet and calculate and see how much
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.800]   is this actually going to be worth it. By the time the debt's paid off, am I actually
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.380]   going to save on interest? So always try to figure out can I surf the interest around?
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:05.400]   And sometimes you may choose to refinance variable interest rates over to fixed interest
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:10.200]   rates, and you may choose to refinance fixed interest rates over to variable interest rates.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.360]   Sometimes a fixed rate mortgage will make sense. Sometimes a variable rate mortgage
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:19.760]   will make sense. Sometimes -- just look at this and figure out the interest rates. Look
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:24.920]   at the fact of is this a secure debt or not? So if I had two equal debts, let's say that
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:32.080]   I had a credit card balance of $20,000 and let's say that I had a car balance of $20,000,
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:36.160]   and if I were sitting there looking at them and if they had equivalent interest rates,
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.480]   which is a big if, because a lot of times a credit card balance, especially if someone
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   has poor credit, will have a much higher interest rate than a car loan. But let's assume I have
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:51.060]   good credit and I have a 0% credit card and I have a close to 0% car loan or something
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:57.580]   like that, then I personally would consider paying off the secured debt first. Because
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:02.880]   in doing planning for disasters, if I wind up in a situation where I lose my job or if
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:07.440]   I wind up in a situation where I have a business shortfall for six months or if I wind up in
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:14.980]   a situation where I get sued or I face financial trouble, I want to make sure that I don't
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:19.620]   lose my car. And so I'd rather have a paid-off car and have a credit card balance, and then
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:24.020]   if I fall behind on my payments, then I just say, "Sorry, I've done my best, but I can't
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:28.420]   do any better." I'd rather have a paid-off car than a paid-off credit card. So think
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:33.980]   about that and look at your situation. Now, if my credit cards are at 18%, variable interest
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:39.960]   rates, and my car loan is affixed at 3%, I probably would choose not to do that because
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.220]   the cost is much too high as far as the interest, so I'd go ahead and pay off the credit cards
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:48.780]   first. But this is why you have to look at your actual situation. I would look at, is
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:53.460]   this debt bankruptable or not? So if worse came to worse and I were forced to declare
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:59.020]   bankruptcy, which I think is a very important aspect of financial planning that we don't
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:03.300]   do, risk management planning, do bankruptcy planning. What if the worst came to worst,
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:08.460]   my teenage daughter hit somebody and it was her fault and I got sued and I didn't have
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:13.580]   the proper insurance and I were forced into bankruptcy by my lawsuit? Well, is my debt
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:20.620]   bankruptable or not? So here the example would be a student loan is not bankruptable, whereas
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:25.060]   a credit card balance probably would be, especially if that credit card balance were a business
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:32.140]   credit card or a car loan would depend. So a personal loan probably would be bankruptable
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:40.620]   or another loan would be bankruptable. So if I were looking and let's assume that in
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:46.940]   my plan I have a student loan balance at an equivalent interest rate of a credit card
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:52.740]   balance, then I may choose to go ahead and pay off the student loans knowing that, again,
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:57.380]   same thing, the credit card is unsecured and it's bankruptable, whereas the student loan
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:02.380]   is also unsecured but it's not bankruptable. So I guess, I don't know, technically that
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:06.900]   wouldn't be unsecured, but it is secured in a sense. They can always come after you for
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.460]   that amount of money. Or if I were looking and I was saying I've got a mortgage that
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:19.020]   I'm interested in paying off and this mortgage has a similar interest rate to a car loan,
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:23.180]   then I may consider going ahead and choosing to pay off the mortgage more quickly because
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:27.540]   at least in my state we've got great bankruptcy protection laws because then I wind up in
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:33.380]   a situation where my house would be debt free and this would be a valuable aspect of my
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:39.540]   asset protection planning. So, I mean, does this matter? I think it does.
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:44.580]   You know, I've worked with various physician clients and I would say if I had – again,
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.820]   depends on the terms. You've got to look at the terms and you've got to run the math.
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:53.140]   Would I be willing to pay off a 3 percent fixed rate mortgage on a house in a scenario
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:59.060]   where I were facing 18 percent credit cards – 18 percent interest on my credit cards?
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:02.140]   No, I probably wouldn't. And I probably actually wouldn't – and I wouldn't prioritize
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:06.540]   paying off the house. I'd prioritize fully funding retirement plans which are also credit
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:13.380]   or protected. So – but you've got to factor this in. Consider it.
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:20.780]   Consider can I refinance this debt? So again, if you know that you have credit card debt
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:25.580]   and it has small balances but you know that you're able – because you have a good
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:29.480]   credit score, you're able to refinance the debt and keep it on zero percent credit cards
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.900]   under the terms and you're expecting that you're going to be able to refinance that,
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:37.540]   then you may go ahead and prioritize the student loans that you can't easily refinance at
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.860]   the higher rate. That to me would be an important thing to consider and always be looking to
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:46.220]   say what can I refinance here, what can I refinance there.
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:50.660]   What are the – one thing I forgot to mention, I wanted to mention on kind of the – is
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:56.980]   this debt secured or not. What about things like 401(k) loans or life insurance loans?
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:02.240]   I would prioritize repaying a 401(k) loan or I would prioritize repaying a life insurance
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:09.920]   loan before I would prioritize paying an unsecured credit card because again, same type of thing.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.560]   My 401(k) loan, if I had a 401(k) loan or if I were working with a client who had a
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:18.120]   401(k) loan which they're not a good plan, I would recommend not pursuing that path.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.480]   But people pursue it and it's there for a reason.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:27.580]   So if you have a 401(k) loan, I would recommend prioritizing the repayment of that so that
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:32.540]   you can restore the balance of the account to the investment earnings so that you could
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:36.820]   be protected in case you lose your job and so that you can restore the asset protection
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:42.180]   nature of the 401(k) and again, look at the terms. What are the terms of the 401(k) loan
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:45.940]   versus the credit cards? But I would much rather do that or pay back a life insurance
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:50.980]   loan that I'm being charged interest on by the life insurance policy. I'd much rather
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:57.300]   pay that back and restore that balance and restore that in a creditor-protected world
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:04.200]   than pay back a credit card that I have at 2.99% first. I mean, I would do that first.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.200]   So consider that.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.060]   And then the last thing would be what is the makeup of this debt? Is this consumer debt
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:14.580]   or is this investment debt? And now again, I recognize that many people who are listening
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:22.540]   to financial shows or reading financial blogs, kind of at the initial level of financial
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:28.860]   awareness is get rid of consumer debt. But consumer debt is not the same thing as investment
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:36.260]   debt. So look for a way to refinance things and take advantage of investment debt. So
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:42.060]   if I had consumer debt that I couldn't figure out a way to refinance and keep it as consumer
[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:47.780]   debt, then I would go ahead and I would look at doing a margin loan on a stock account.
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:52.660]   And then I could -- or depending on what assets I have and depending on how it's structured
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:58.380]   and depending on the terms of the loan. But if I can take out a margin loan on a taxable
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:03.220]   account and use that to pay off my consumer debt, then now I've converted that from a
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:09.100]   non-deductible consumer debt over to a deductible debt, which is deductible against my growth
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:16.060]   in my investment account. So that helps to offset my taxes on any gain in my taxable
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:22.420]   account. So there's a variety of ways of looking at this. And again, I just would plead that
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:28.860]   we do a better job of thinking it through. So I think those are the primary things that
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:32.500]   I wanted to communicate today. I hope this show is interesting. And I hope that this
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.940]   can provide some ideas. And these are just ideas that I've thought of over the years
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:42.460]   as I've looked at client situations. And again, my major premise is that we will be far better
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:49.540]   served by individually looking at client situations or individually looking at our friend's situations
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:55.480]   or people that we're helping with their money rather than just simply saying, "This is what's
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:03.020]   always right." It is useful to teach things through. It is useful to teach, "Here's what
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:07.140]   a snowball method would be. Here's what an avalanche method is." And sometimes I forget
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:12.940]   because I have gotten astonished many times in working with clients. And I think, "Why
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:18.580]   are you doing this?" When I see people doing the little extra here in their method, I just
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:24.420]   think, "Why are you doing this?" But I can help those people and you can help those people.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:28.380]   Sit down and help build out a spreadsheet. And the last thing I love about this spreadsheet,
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:31.620]   I encourage you, if you've never done this for yourself or if you've never played with
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:35.620]   these numbers, go to the link in the show notes and download the spreadsheet and put
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:39.740]   some numbers in and play with some scenarios because you need to play with the scenarios
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:43.620]   to see the cases in which a snowball would make sense and an avalanche would make sense.
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:50.620]   You want to calculate what is the actual interest that's paid. I've done this sometimes for
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:57.420]   clients and I've done lots of these spreadsheets. And many times, the makeup of the debts and
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:02.700]   the amount of interest that is--and the interest rates, you look at it and say, "Look, you've
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:07.900]   got an extra $332 of interest if you pay the highest interest rate first instead of the
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:11.900]   lowest balance first." You absolutely, in my opinion, in that scenario, you should go
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:16.620]   with the lowest balance and you should make sure you harvest this behavioral win. On the
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:22.780]   other hand, look at it and say, "How can I harvest the behavioral win? How can I harvest
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:27.340]   the interest rate savings? And how can I keep these other factors in mind that I've mentioned
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:32.100]   of the terms of the debt?" And what the thing I like about this spreadsheet, you can put
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:36.020]   it in as in a custom order. So you would enter in, "Okay, I'm going to do this one, this
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:39.700]   one, then this one, then this one," and then you can compare it to your baseline, whatever
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:43.100]   your baseline is. If your baseline is highest interest rate first, and you can see, "Here's
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:48.220]   how many months to pay this off. Here's how this will work. And here's how I can really
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:53.500]   answer this. I can really--you know, here's what my total cost will be." So play with
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:56.820]   the numbers. I hope that you enjoy this chart if you've never found one like this. It's
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:01.580]   the most useful one because it's the most visible. Quick tip for you, make sure you
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:05.660]   look at the first page, which is the calculator, and the second page, which is the payment
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:10.820]   schedule. And the nice thing about the payment schedule is you can add in additional payments
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:15.540]   using the debt payoff nomenclature. This would be called debt snowflakes. So you can say,
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:21.940]   "Okay, let's assume that I have an extra Christmas bonus of a thousand bucks. What if I pay a
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.900]   one-time extra bonus of a thousand bucks on Christmas?" And you can plop that in on the
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:31.260]   second sheet of this chart, which is the payment schedule. And I find that to be a really useful
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:37.380]   tool. And I guess the last thing is--that I have is I find this--I have found this chart
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:42.260]   to be incredibly motivating for clients and motivating for me as well. And paying off
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:47.540]   debt can be very motivating for people when they can see how it works. Debt is such a--paying
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:54.060]   off debt is such a tangible, powerful goal. This is why it's so actionable, is because
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:59.780]   it's such a tangible goal. You know there is a clear finish line. Getting wealthy is
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:04.700]   less of a powerful goal because there's--what's the finish line? What's the number? And that
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:09.420]   number changes all the time and that's why it's so powerful to harness this behavior
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:13.860]   modification of paying off debt. I don't think ultimately paying off debt is necessarily
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:18.420]   going to make someone happy because you still got to figure out the lifestyle factors. But
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:26.980]   it certainly can be--is an important step on the road to get there. And I hope you like
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:30.780]   this--I hope you like this chart. I found that when I've done this for clients and given
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:35.260]   it to them and allow them to play with the numbers. And what I do, just a final quick
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:41.340]   tip is I go through the cash flow statement and I say, "Okay, look." And I use this side
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:45.740]   by side with the cash flow statement. In many ways, this debt spreadsheet, if someone is
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:50.740]   in debt, this--I view this as kind of a third statement, a statement of liabilities if you
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:56.500]   want to be precise. And what we do is we go through the cash flow statement and we mark
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.460]   some changes. And we say, "Okay, if you were going to adjust this area of your cash flow,
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.460]   okay, you're going to--let's say that, you know, a simple one, you're going to cut your
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.340]   cell phone bill. Okay, you're going to cut your cell phone bill, then you're going to
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:11.220]   make this change and so therefore there's an extra 50 bucks. And so now if we go from,
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:15.260]   you know, $2,000 of payments, we go to--or an extra $100 a month, that would be easier.
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:19.900]   So now we go to $2,100 of payments. Then in my little scenario I've got sitting in front
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:26.940]   of me, at $2,000 a month using the snowball, then this person was out of debt in 27 months.
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:32.460]   At $2,100 a month, then this is out of debt in 25 months. And so now we can figure out
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:37.580]   the opportunity cost and we can bring it into an opportunity cost and say, "Would you rather
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:42.420]   have the fancier cell phone with the--and pay the extra $100? Would you rather be out
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:47.060]   of debt two months sooner and save--" Let's see what's the difference, $7,100 of interest
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:54.340]   versus--let's look here, versus $7,494 of interest and save the $300 of interest and
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:57.980]   be out of debt with the balance two months sooner. And there's no right or wrong, you
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:01.940]   know, it's all a matter of choices. We all have tradeoffs, we all have choices and this
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:07.780]   is life. We're adults, we can choose for ourselves what we prefer. In one answer, one scenario,
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:11.420]   the question may be, "Yes, I would prefer that." And the other question may be, "No."
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:16.460]   And now we have some numbers that we can put behind it. And these numbers, I think, are
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:20.180]   valuable. So that's our show for today. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope I didn't come
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:24.740]   across--I hope I didn't come across as too strong. I really am a nice guy and I'm not--I
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:30.100]   just--I guess I'm just sharing, you know, some of the things that I have learned and
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:35.060]   working with clients. I just--I want to--I want us to raise the level of our advice for
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:38.940]   ourselves and for others. Let's take it up a notch. Let's get a little more professional.
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:44.220]   Let's understand a little bit more. And if someone gets motivated just by a debt snowball,
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:49.540]   that's awesome. But at some point--but I just hate to see people make mistakes that cost
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:54.260]   them because they don't know how to calculate the impact. You know, when I see somebody
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:58:00.540]   cash out a 401(k), pay the penalty in interest and do this to pay off a debt that's low interest
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:05.140]   rate, I just look at it and I say, "Arr, did you actually run the cost of that?" If you
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:09.660]   did and you made that decision, it's your money. But man, that's an expensive decision
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:14.260]   sometimes. And look at the lost power of the money that you would have had, the lost compounding
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:18.660]   that you would have had if you had done it, if you had continued, you know, if you continued
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:23.740]   on the plan. So, hopefully this is a useful resource for you. I wanted to create it as
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:27.780]   something I could point people to so that they're helping--so that you can kind of guide
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:32.460]   yourself through what order should I pay things off. I hope it's a useful resource for you.
