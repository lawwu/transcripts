[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   the two centurion cards the black cards i will just briefly run over them because i think it's
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   interesting to understand what they have but i'm not going to spend a lot of time because i actually
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.320]   don't think they're that compelling i'll kind of go over them together they both have a ten thousand
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.920]   dollar initiation fee plus a five thousand dollar a year annual fee plus another five thousand dollar
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.120]   per authorized user fee from what i understand you need to be spending over 250 000 a year with
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.120]   amex to even be invited but i know lots of people who have spent that much and not been invited the
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.080]   primary thing you get from this aside from you know supposedly a much better concierge and much
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.920]   better travel advisors i've only probably known two or three people that have ever had the card or had
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.080]   a close friend with the card they haven't really been using those things as much because at that
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.720]   level of spend and at that level of income you probably have an assistant that can do a lot of that
