[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.600]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue, our show dictated by you, the viewers, where you send
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.320]   us in questions. We answer them. Our inbox is full all the time. Remember, if you have
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.720]   a question, email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. Duncan, I think this week I actually pulled
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.800]   a question directly from the comments on YouTube.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.720]   Oh, nice. I was wondering where that one came from.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.180]   I'm a psycho, so I read all the comments, but I will say, our viewers and listeners
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.240]   are usually pretty nice. We've got a lot to get to today, so let's do the first one.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.840]   Okay. So, first up, we have a question from Tony, who writes, "Will demographics lead
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.640]   to reduced asset buying as boomers spend down their retirement and transfer wealth to kids
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.960]   upon death?" So, starting off with an upbeat one.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.360]   Yeah. This is a common one, and I think we answered something similar a couple months
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.120]   ago, but that was dealing more with the stock market. So, the idea there was, wealth is
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.840]   concentrated in the hands of the few. The top 10% own something like 89% of the stocks
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.560]   in the U.S. So, my take there is, like, there's not going to be many forced sellers. A lot
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.480]   of it will just end up getting transferred because it's all rich people who won't need
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.480]   to sell.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.560]   And even as the boomers do begin selling their assets, the millennials are going to come
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.440]   into their prime earnings years. So, John, let's do the chart out of this most common
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.960]   ages in the United States. So, the Census Bureau publishes this, the most common ages,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.600]   and they rank them. And you can see it starts in 2010, and in 2020, then they predict out
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.560]   to 2025, 2030, 2035. You can see in 2010, the young people are just starting to come
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.480]   up. Now, almost all of the most common ages are 20s, 30s, 40s. It's going up to that because
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.000]   the millennials are getting older, right?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.120]   So, I actually think that, and the millennials are now the biggest demographic in the country.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.880]   I think that the millennials actually are going to have a bigger impact going forward
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.160]   than the boomers. And I want to look at this beyond the stock market. So, let's show this
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.400]   ownership of financial assets. This is kind of what I was getting into. And this just
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.560]   shows stocks versus housing. You can see that the top 1%, the majority of their assets are
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.400]   in financial assets, stocks and bonds and real estate and that sort of stuff. But their
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.160]   primary residence isn't that big of a deal.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.160]   But for the bottom 50%, especially, and even the 50 to 90%, primary residence is a huge
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.860]   driver of their financial net worth. So, I want to talk about how this demographic stuff
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.800]   is going to impact the real estate market. So, I never really bought into this idea following
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.000]   2008 after the housing crisis that millennials were never going to buy homes and they were
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.640]   never going to drive cars and they were never going to move to the suburbs because that's
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.760]   what people do when they get older.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.200]   I think millennials just kind of pushed it out a little bit because they went to school
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.600]   a little longer in a lot of cases. This is the most highly educated demographic ever
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.360]   in terms of going to college. And they just pushed it back a little bit because of the
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.800]   crisis. And so, as people get older, they take on more responsibilities and they damn
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.840]   sure are going to buy a house in most cases, right?
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.880]   And millennials are buying houses in force right now. Show this chart from the Wall Street
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.180]   Journal here, John. Millennials are buying, this is home purchase applications from the
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.900]   Wall Street Journal. You can see millennials in 2015 were about 35%. Now it's well over
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.380]   50%. And at 40 years old, I technically am the oldest living millennial in the country,
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.900]   I think. Either that or the youngest Gen X. I think I'm the oldest millennial.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.900]   Yeah, I think you are.
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.500]   And I'm thinking about this, the demographic wave from my experience. So, we purchased
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.780]   our first home, I think I was 25, 26, had been married for maybe a year at that point.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.780]   And we kind of said, "Oh, this is going to be our forever home." Then our family got
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.220]   bigger and so we moved on. I think we were in that house for nine or ten years and life
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.460]   got in the way. My wife and I had twins and we realized we're not going to fit in this
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.700]   house anymore. It's not going to work. We had to move. And I think so many people in
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.500]   finance look at this stuff from an investing perspective instead of life events, especially
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.020]   when it comes to housing, right?
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.580]   So people, like life events don't care about investments and mortgage rates and prices
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.180]   and ROI and all these things. And so right now with all these millennials buying, and
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.860]   many of them in household formation years and buying their first home, it's impossible
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.140]   to find a starter home right now, right? And that's why those prices are rising so fast.
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.740]   I think in five to seven years, it's going to be impossible to find that next level home.
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.940]   So we did this five years ago. We kind of traded up, went into a little bit of a bigger,
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.700]   nicer home. I think that's going to happen at the end of this decade. So you have all
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.660]   the millennials buying now, these starter homes, but in five to seven years, they're
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.300]   going to be ready to trade up. And I think maybe that's when some boomer selling will
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.780]   happen. So we have 10,000 baby boomers returning every day from now until 2030. I would guess
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.700]   the next shortage of housing, millennials are just going to go through this housing
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.060]   market like a snake, like a snake eating a rabbit, right? Going through.
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.420]   So in five to seven years, that next trade up level, which could be some of the boomers
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.980]   selling their houses, I think that is going to be the most crowded. And unfortunately,
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.020]   I think for millennials, like probably every huge purchase you're gonna have to make in
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.260]   your life is just going to be way more expensive than prior generations. Think about college,
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.540]   the stock market, housing, cars, daycare, all this stuff. I think millennials have to
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.060]   get used to this. So I know this question was asking about boomers, but I actually think
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.300]   the millennial demographic is going to have a much greater impact on financial markets
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.860]   going forward. And boomers have plenty of time through retirement. You know, they could
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.900]   have two, three, four decades to spend things down. It's going to happen on a slower basis.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.740]   Millennials I think are going to have a way bigger impact. And if boomers do start selling
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.740]   their stocks, guess what? Millennials are now moving into their prime earnings years
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.220]   and they're going to be the buyers.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.020]   - Yeah, I mean, well, the thing I was going to say is where you hit the nail on the head.
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.660]   It turns out everyone does want a house, right? That's what we're seeing.
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.660]   - It seemed like, yeah, okay. Housing market crashed and I saw my parents lose their house.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.060]   I'm never going to buy one. That lasted only so long until you grow up and you realize
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.980]   this is what happens. Like you become an adult, right? If 20-year-old me could see 40-year-old
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.860]   me sitting at home on a Friday night, reading a book instead of going out and having fun,
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.020]   he'd put a gun to my head. But this is what happens when you get older, right? You stop
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.820]   going out and you become boring. It happens to everyone.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.820]   - Yeah, I guess.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.100]   - All right, let's do the next one.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.420]   - Okay. So up next we have, "You guys have been absolutely wonderful at teaching us some
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.340]   valuable lessons. Hate to admit this, but I'm terrible at investing. My ability to withstand
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.100]   a drawdown is just awful. Don't want to save cash my entire life, but I also have such
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.900]   little risk tolerance. I'm 31 and my goals include getting married, buying a house."
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.960]   There we go. Et cetera. Any thoughts on my predicament?
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.620]   - The good news is this person knows who they are as an investor. There's that old saying
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.860]   that the stock market is an expensive place to figure out who you are as an investor.
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.580]   This person already knows. And I always say a good strategy is vastly superior to a perfect
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.780]   strategy you can't stick with, right? The good one you can stick with makes a lot more
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.460]   sense. So there's three main factors I've talked about before in terms of setting your
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.940]   risk profile as an investor. Your willingness, need, and ability to take risk.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.340]   As a young person, your ability to take risk is nearly infinite because you have your human
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.520]   capital, which is your future earnings that you can use to save, and you have time on
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.280]   your hand. You have many decades ahead of you. But if you're not willing to take risk,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.420]   it doesn't matter what your ability is because you're bound to make a stake in your portfolio
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.900]   at the worst possible time. So the fact that this person knows this, that's good. I think
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.480]   the simplest answer is to fix your need to take risk. That means cranking up your savings
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.900]   rate, right? If you're not willing to take a lot of risk, crank up your savings rate.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.540]   That'll hopefully decrease your stress in other areas of your financial life as well,
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.980]   and I think offset some things. The next easy piece is thinking about asset allocation.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.820]   So this is your other risk dial. So John, let's do a chart on of the drawdowns. This
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.580]   is some various asset allocations I created going from 90/10 down to 40/60. And the S&P
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.940]   500, this is in March of 2020, was down around 35%. You can see a portfolio that was 40%
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:26.660]   stocks and 60% bonds only lost 15%. A 50/50 portfolio lost 18 and a 60/40 was down like
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.140]   21%. So placing more conservative holdings in your portfolio like high quality bonds
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.220]   or cash is a great way to dampen volatility during a drawdown. Now let's look at the other
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:41.500]   side of this. Let's do the chart since the bottom in March of 2020. You can see the S&P
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:48.140]   500 is up almost 100%. A 40/60 portfolio has risen 33%. 50/50 is up 42. So that's the tradeoff.
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:54.260]   Investing is all about tradeoffs. Bonds or cash, I guess cash for that matter if you're
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.980]   looking at this kind of thing for conservative investments, might not give you great returns
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.460]   going forward, but it can provide something of an emotional volatility and help you not
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.540]   make poor decisions at the wrong time. And since you're already saving for things like
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.340]   a house and wedding and more conservative, then that makes sense to keep money there.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.700]   And I think the other thing you could do is potentially try to separate these by location
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.740]   and just keep all of your risk assets in a 401(k) that you're not gonna be able to touch
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.460]   for decades anyway because of tax penalties and all this kind of thing. And I do think
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.940]   this is more of a behavioral question than anything. So let's bring in a guy who's been
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.580]   writing about and talking about behavioral finance probably since I was in college and
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:36.100]   I was 20 going out all the time. Our firm's namesake, Barry Rittholz, who's been talking
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.100]   about this stuff forever.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.100]   Hey, Barry.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:44.260]   Hey, guys. How's it going? So I liked your answer to that question, Ben. And the behavioral
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.660]   side is really fascinating because stop and think about it for a second. When we look
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:55.940]   at professionals, when we look at mutual fund investors and how well they do when the question,
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.940]   the person who wrote the question said, "I'm terrible at investing." Well, so are most
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:08.060]   of the pros. Over a decade-long period, 85% of professional mutual fund managers are underperforming
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:14.220]   their index. That's before we work in fees. And so all the bold-faced names that everybody
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:20.860]   knows—Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch and go down the list—they're the exceptions.
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.300]   We know who they are because, you know, they're the Hank Aarons. They're the home run—they're
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.660]   the Michael Jordans. My frame of reference is a little older than you guys, so I go back
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:36.860]   to different sports figures. But essentially, you're terrible at investing, questioner,
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.420]   because we're all terrible at investing, most of us really bad. And if you're concerned
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:46.820]   about drawdowns and you're concerned about risk assets, put it in a broad index fund.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:52.860]   Go to Vanguard. Get a very simple fund. Check it once a year. And in 40 years, you'll thank
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:59.380]   us. You don't have to be—you know, the business of stocks, the day-to-day buying,
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:05.220]   selling, squaring up positions, syndicates, IPO loans, that's professional trading. You
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:10.500]   don't need to be involved in that. What you need to say is, "I want to invest in America.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:16.260]   I want to invest in the ingenuity and creativity of the entrepreneur class, and I'll check
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:21.760]   back in 20, 30, 40 years, and it's fine." I know it's easier said than done, but the
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:28.260]   day-to-day noise is what distracts us from thinking about the long term. And, you know,
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.940]   shut your TV off. Don't read the—if you don't have to for work, why would you want
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:39.500]   to read the business section? Who cares what this fund manager or that CEO or that new
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.940]   IPO is doing if you're not in the business? Own the entire market, put it away for a few
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.460]   decades, and retire comfortably.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.820]   >> Right. I've heard Josh talk about this. Like, you could be like us and pay attention
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.340]   to stuff all the time, so you become essentially immunized to it, right? Or you can be someone
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.780]   else who just, like, completely ignores it, but getting stuck in the middle where you
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.840]   kind of pay attention and kind of don't, that's the hard part. I think you need some sort
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.220]   of barriers, and that could be, "Okay, I'm not going to have a Robinhood account. I'm
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.940]   only going to invest my long-term risk assets in tax-deferred accounts, and it's going to
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.900]   be a target date fund or index funds or whatever like that, in a 401(k) or an IRA, and I'm
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.360]   just never going to look at it. And the other stuff, I'm not going to even tempt myself
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.980]   with because I know that I'm going to make mistakes."
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:18.980]   >> You know--
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.700]   >> That's why I was going to say it's hard to not pay attention these days with Robinhood
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.980]   sending you, like, push notifications, "Oh, this holding's down 5% today," you know?
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.660]   >> You shouldn't have a Robinhood account if you're a long-term investor. And one last
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:35.340]   thing about, you know, the questioner saying, "I'm terrible about this," you know, evolution
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:43.200]   has trained us to, when we are threatened with actual danger, what happens is your stomach
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.900]   tightens up, your heart rate speeds up, your breathing becomes more deep, and you are prepared
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:53.820]   to either fight or flight. The people who did not have that sort of reaction, well,
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:12:00.100]   you know, Darwin is really, you know, undefeated, and the people who were kind of chill, they
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:06.220]   didn't hang around to have progeny. So all of us who are around today are around because
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:13.240]   a couple hundred thousand years ago, our ancestors responded to threats very emotionally, very
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.580]   actively, and very aggressively. And so the residue of that is, "Oh, no, the market's
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:24.200]   down 15%, you know, I have to fight or flight." And that's what leads to people in a panic
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:30.300]   dumping stocks at the exact worst time. Once you recognize that, once you figure out that
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:35.740]   this is my lizard brain trying to keep me alive to procreate and pass genes on to future
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:42.340]   generations, you have to put yourself in a circumstance where you're unable to do damage.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.980]   And whether that's all your investments in a 401(k) or just indexing and not looking
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:52.200]   at it, that's your best solution. Don't let your lizard brain affect your retirement.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.720]   I think what Barry's trying to say is that I can blame my great, great, great grandfather
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.120]   for me buying Zillow last year and getting smoked, right? I blame them.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.720]   And if he didn't do that, you wouldn't be here. If he was kind of chill about it, if
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:11.840]   he had no reaction, you know, walking down, I love all the pattern recognition errors.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.200]   If you're walking along a path and you jump because you see a stick rustling that you
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.880]   see is a snake, well, that's good. You know, it scares you, but you're still around. The
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.280]   person who's blasé about that, eventually a snake bites them and they don't have kids.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.600]   All right. Duncan, let's do both of these next questions since they're both about writing
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.920]   and blogging, and that's why I wanted to bring Barry on today. So just read both of them
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.760]   so we can just give a general discussion on writing and what we think about that.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:42.640]   >> Okay. Cool. So this one's a long one, but we do this show as a podcast now, too, so
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.900]   I'm reading the whole thing for those of you watching. Sorry. I've considered starting
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.780]   my own blog over the years mostly for a place to put my thoughts rather than for any type
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:55.120]   of revenue stream. Each time I'm ready to start, I seem to fall into a paralysis by
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:01.280]   analysis on the form and style. I'm torn between doing pseudonymous writing to protect myself
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.320]   and to be able to speak more freely, read naively on topics, or a more formal connection
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.680]   to my professional life and getting my thoughts out there as a resume/career builder. On certain
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.360]   topics, I can speak from a place of expertise, but others, I'm just hoping to get thoughts
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.680]   out there and potentially prompt a conversation with readers and maybe have them help educate
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.600]   me. I'm curious if you've faced these concerns earlier in your career and if you have any
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.640]   recommendations for someone like me.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.640]   >> That's a lot.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.640]   >> That is a lot.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.840]   >> All right. Do the next one real quick so we can just do both of these.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.280]   >> Okay. So the next one is, "I work for a small family-run investment firm. We send
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.680]   our clients monthly market emails and quarterly emails regarding portfolios. My issue is that
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.840]   while I'm the primary author of these emails, I don't really feel qualified to write them.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.600]   I feel disconnected from my audience because I'm 36 years old and have plenty of time to
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.760]   invest while the audience members are mostly retired boomers or retired boomers. I feel
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.680]   that my time horizon is hindering my ability to connect with my audience. Do you have any
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.660]   advice regarding what I should write about? I'm hoping to find a sweet spot that would
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.440]   allow me to explore other concepts in finance without totally losing the audience."
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.040]   >> So these are pretty similar questions. I'm sure, Barry, you've gotten these a lot
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.880]   over the years. You've been doing this a lot longer than me. But it's kind of like, should
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.520]   I take this leap and just do this and start writing? And then what happens if people give
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.200]   me negative feedback? And what happens if I'm not any good and I say some wrong things?
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:21.480]   And the other thing is, okay, what do I write about? Right? So these are the two main questions.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.680]   You've been doing this since probably when I was in college, I guess.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   >> Late '90s, yeah.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.560]   >> So what was the impetus for you for starting a blog?
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:36.620]   >> So, you know, we forget how the world has changed. I had three main motivations to write
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.080]   the blog. The first was I wanted to always be able to access the things I was working
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:50.600]   on. Now, this is before Google Docs and G-Drive and Sheets and all that stuff, or even Dropbox.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.680]   So if I wanted access to something on the Internet, I had to post it somewhere so I
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.080]   could circle back. If I'm at home, if I'm in the office, if I'm out at the beach on
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.160]   the weekend, you know, you just take it for granted that all that stuff is accessible
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:08.880]   today. It wasn't. If you didn't print a copy and take it with you, or publish it on GeoCities,
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.680]   you didn't have access to it. I guess you could theoretically email stuff back and forth
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.440]   all the time, but that just became tedious. So that was one thing. The other thing was,
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.200]   at the time I was working first as a trader and then as a strategist, and we had a couple
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.640]   hundred brokers and I got tired of answering the same questions. In the morning meeting
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.520]   you mentioned a company. What was the name of that? So I started putting the whole morning
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.680]   meetings on GeoCities. And hey, you know where the site is. Go get it. You know, don't ask
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:42.540]   me what the stock symbol is for EMC. It used to be, like, make me crazy or get questions
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:48.400]   like that. So that was one, two. And the third thing was, you just write to understand what
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:53.840]   your thoughts are when you're, you know, a little removed from it. We have terrible hindsight
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:59.980]   bias and narrative fallacy allows us to fool ourselves, sort of like a trading journal.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.920]   Here's why I want to own this. Here's what I'm thinking. Here's what I think the upside
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.720]   and the downside is. After the fact, we just are too good at rationalizing and lying to
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:15.400]   ourselves. So, gee, why did I write? I thought that this company, you know, I remember Apple
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:24.040]   had 15 with $13 cash and the, had an argument with the compliance people that 45 was my
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:30.760]   upside target. This is like 15 splits ago. So it's the equivalent of like 4,000. So when
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.280]   you see it and go back and look at it, it's like, oh, I thought the stock could triple.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.960]   What the hell did I know? It was selling it as a triple, worst trade ever. So that's the
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:45.720]   other reason to actually write stuff down. And last, if you want to become a better writer,
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:51.000]   there's only two things that you have to do. Write a lot every day, preferably, and read
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.920]   good writing. And so putting stuff down on paper in public will make you a better writer.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:02.680]   It forces you to recognize your audience and it forces you to accept feedback whether you
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.760]   want it or not. Now, you have to develop a little bit of a thick skin and ignore, you
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.560]   know, the trolls and the haters, but you get a lot of great feedback from people who are
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.280]   genuinely interested in what you're talking about.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.240]   - And I also think that, like, if you're first and foremost writing to build an audience,
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.240]   if that's your goal, that's not a great goal. And I never did that. I don't know. I started
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.600]   at the same thing as you. I wanted to answer questions where people were constantly giving
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.360]   me and start some sort of library and almost a journal for myself. But sometimes I even
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.600]   forget that there are people on the other end reading the stuff that I write, right?
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.600]   - Yeah.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.640]   - And so I think you have to write about stuff that interests you personally, not like trying
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.080]   to put something out there that you think other people are gonna figure out. And like
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.720]   you said, this, becoming a writer, I never realized it. It forced me to become like a
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:51.680]   better learner, a better reader, become more curious, and become a better communicator.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.360]   Like, 'cause you're right, it's, I was never one who liked writing before, like in high
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.200]   school and college. I hated writing papers. But then you find a subject you like writing
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   about and you wanna write about it more, and I feel like it is a muscle that you can get
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.200]   better at. You can make it stronger, right?
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.160]   - Yeah, it's not homework when it's something you wanna do. And the old joke is if you wanna
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.860]   learn how to, really learn how to do something, teach it. So, you know, I used to use the
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:21.160]   blog because I kinda did a deep dive about 20 years ago into jazz. I was always a classic
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:27.660]   rock sort of guy. But I found about 30 years ago the American Songbook and toured singers
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.600]   like Sinatra and Fitzgerald and Julie London and working with Sarah Vaughan, et cetera,
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.560]   et cetera, et cetera. So I started doing these Friday posts, Friday night posts, weekend
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:43.440]   jazz or Friday night jazz. And it's, you learn so much when you have the ability to briefly
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.800]   explain it to someone and just say, "Hey, if you're interested in X, look at this and
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.680]   here's why this is important." Now, lately, I've been doing that with cars. I've been
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:56.080]   trying to learn more about the classic car market. So every Friday, I throw up, "Here's
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.480]   an interesting car. Here's what makes it unique. Here's what's crazy about the pricing. This
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:06.640]   is either really cheap or this is really expensive." And it's revealing about a niche little market
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.720]   that you can leap off from. But it could be anything. You know, JC was doing this with
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:17.840]   wines for a while, talking about rinds. Ed Giardini writes about movies and has been
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:24.980]   doing a movie review in his weekly market update for like 30 years. It's incredible.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.400]   So you really develop an expertise by being able to explain it to third parties.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.640]   And other people will give you feedback if you're wrong. Like the internet is full of
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.160]   people who are more knowledgeable than you in a lot of areas and they give you feedback.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.980]   I think your other point that was really good is about, I was sick of answering questions
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.280]   for people. So this very last question where the guy says, "What do I write about if I
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.200]   feel like I'm not connecting to my audience?" Like even if you, so this is a younger advisor
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.840]   and he's got older clients. I think even if you have some sort of age gap, you know the
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.360]   general questions your clients are going to ask or have asked in the past. So build a
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.360]   library of questions that they're going to ask in the future about rising interest rates
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.280]   or higher inflation or lower inflation or bear markets or whatever. And then when they
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.080]   ask it in the future, inevitably you go, "Oh, I wrote about that two years ago. Here's this
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.600]   piece." And then guess what? You're an expert. You've already thought about this and people
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.360]   say, "Oh, this person knows what they're doing." That's the whole thing. Build a library and
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.560]   just go straight to your clients and the stuff that they're going to ask you.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:26.000]   You know, writing, especially publicly, teaches you to develop better listening skills. I'll
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.880]   be the first to admit I have horrible listening skills. But when you're out in public saying
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:35.360]   something you really have to be aware when several people start saying, "Hey, you're
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.240]   talking about X, Y, Z and I work in that space and here's why you're not quite right and
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.600]   here's what you're missing." You have to learn how to A, recognize when you're making an
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.880]   error or a mistake and owning it and getting better from it, but B, respecting your audience
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.880]   and being empathetic. You don't have to write for a specific audience, but if you're 30
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:01.620]   and your clients are 66, well, you have to stop and say, "Hey, they don't have 40 years
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:07.120]   of work ahead of them and they don't have the ability to bounce back from a 30% drawdown.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.920]   That's going to be really problematic, so I have to put myself in their shoes." So developing
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:18.480]   some listening skills and some empathy goes a long way. Even if you're not custom writing
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.920]   to that audience, at least they need to know you understand who they are, you respect them
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.000]   and you're aware of their circumstances. I think that really makes a big difference.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.920]   >> Yeah. Knowing your audience is huge. And so I, when I first started writing, my audience
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.400]   to me, the only people who were reading were my friends and family. So I tried to simplify
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.080]   and dumb it down as much as I could and then I started getting people following me who
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.840]   were financial advisors saying, "Hey, this is perfect for my clients because they don't
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.340]   follow this stuff." I think people in finance take that for granted. We follow this stuff
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.880]   all the time. We could use all this jargon and really complex terminology and stuff and
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.680]   it would be useful for 2% of our audience. But what's the point if you don't know your
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.400]   audience enough to be able to simplify it and explain it and use analogies?
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.400]   >> It's showing off at a certain point, right?
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.760]   >> Yeah. So what's the point? And I always found that off-putting to the people I'd work
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.480]   with in finance when I first started out because I didn't understand a lot of it. And so I
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.120]   think being able to simplify the message too and make it useful to a broader audience is
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.360]   a huge skill that you can use in a lot of different areas in life.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.080]   >> And Ben, I'm going to give you a compliment. You talk about financial advisors. I just
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:21.040]   had a meeting with a very senior person at Vanguard and they were discussing an internal
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.160]   debate where they talked about tax loss harvesting and they talked about home prices and they
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:33.440]   talked about bonds. And some of your posts are getting circulated within Vanguard for
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:40.000]   them to send to their clients who are advisors because you do such a good job explaining
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.040]   what can be pretty complex issues in a way that's understandable without talking down
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:52.800]   to people. Plus, you use numbers, data, charts in a way that most other financial writers
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:58.080]   you're clear of. And it's the perfect balance. And hey, Vanguard is what? $8 trillion? It's
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.920]   nice to see your work getting circulated there.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.560]   >> I think they just like it because it fits their price. It's free to pass around.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:10.160]   >> Well, it's not just Vanguard. I've heard that at other shops also. I've heard stuff.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.120]   >> The first Barry Ritholtz stuff I ever read was at the street. What was it? Trading Diary?
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.440]   What was it where you were explaining that?
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:20.240]   >> The Apprentice Investor where it was, these are the lessons that you learn on a trading
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:26.120]   desk that when you move to becoming a long-term investor, you have to really bring over these
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:31.440]   skills and one of them was, hey, you got to expect to be wrong. That was like one of the...
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.560]   And I got a ton of pushback. Well, who bats a thousand as an investor or a trader? The
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:42.200]   sooner you recognize... And then the math is even more interesting. If you talk to some
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.880]   of the professional investors who are on Twitter, they'll tell you, you don't even need to be
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:52.800]   50/50. As long as your losses are small and your winners are much bigger, you could have
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.880]   a 300 batting average and still outperform the market if you're a professional trader
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.880]   and doing all these things. For the average punter, for the average person who's just
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.600]   a dabbler, it's very, very hard. It's just so counterintuitive.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.000]   >> Did the street keep that for you? Is it still alive somewhere?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.800]   >> I ended up moving all the posts over to the blog, over the big picture. And if you
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:21.760]   pick the category Apprentice Investor, you'll see that whole run. I think almost all of
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.760]   them are up there.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.640]   >> Okay. We'll find a link and put it in the comments, right, Duncan?
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.000]   >> Yeah. Well, I already have a link to that and here's what it looks like, the big picture.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.880]   I was just going to say from an audience perspective, I'm a non-blogger, the only non-blogger on
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:41.120]   here. The pseudonymous thing, I was just going to say quickly, to me, I like so much more
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.920]   reading you guys' stuff and reading people who you can kind of relate to and you know
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:51.240]   who's behind it. So the pseudonymous thing, I think, takes on a different kind of relationship
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.440]   with the reader when they have no idea who's behind it.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.800]   >> And Barry talking about posting on Jazz and Cars, if you don't show a little bit of
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.960]   a personality, I think it's going to be hard for the reader to connect with you. The stuff
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.080]   that Michael and I talk about on the podcast is that we get the most feedback about is
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.920]   our TV and movie recommendations. Either they're great or awful, right?
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:13.640]   >> Well, because you hate it on Wes Anderson. >> I specifically added that as my first question
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.920]   during the lockdown on the podcast. That and the book question, you know, what are you
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.200]   streaming during lockdown? What are your favorite books? What are you reading right now? People
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.880]   love those sorts of things because, hey, if I like this person and I trust their judgment
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:32.600]   and I'm simpatico with their kind of view of culture and entertainment or whatever,
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.360]   and they say, "Ah, I just finished Trillions to interview Robin Wigglesworth, and I was
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.280]   surprised how much I liked it," people will take that recommendation more seriously than
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.200]   just somebody out hawking whatever their latest book is.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:49.280]   >> All right. If you have a used car to sell, Barry is always in the market. Leave a link
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:55.120]   in the comments. Remember, if you have a question for us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. We finally
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.480]   hit our big round number this week. Duncan, everyone was very excited, 100,000 subscribers
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.040]   on the YouTube channel. >> Congratulations. That's amazing.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.640]   >> Which is very cool. Duncan is a huge part of that, so we appreciate that. Thanks to
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.020]   Barry for coming on again. You'll definitely be on again in the future.
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.960]   >> My pleasure. Duncan, next time you come out here, we'll take you over to McLaren.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.600]   There's a dealership 10 minutes from me. >> Awesome. Let's do it.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.760]   >> See you all next week. >> Sounds good. See you, everyone.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:29.320]   >> Bye. [MUSIC]
