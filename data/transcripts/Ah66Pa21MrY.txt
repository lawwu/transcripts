[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]   especially when you're traveling alone, I do it too.
[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.020]   It's the best social crutch there is, right?
[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.880]   If you're sitting alone and you feel nervous about it
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.240]   or you're bored or whatever else,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.380]   you immediately pull out your phone,
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.340]   but that signals to everyone else that you're busy
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.280]   or you're closed off.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.980]   The amount of conversations that I've started
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.260]   from just sitting somewhere and just looking around,
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.780]   like people used to do when they had downtime,
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.260]   just kind of staring into space
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.580]   and making eye contact with someone, saying hello.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.220]   Next thing you know, they say hello.
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.060]   How are you?
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.580]   Next thing you know, you're getting invited
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.020]   to grandma's house for dinner.
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.380]   That has happened so many times.
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.380]   I think people are naturally curious,
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.460]   especially for solo travelers.
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.260]   They're curious why you're visiting their home,
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.860]   what you're up to while you're there,
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.740]   if you actually have the best recommendations
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.180]   or if you're going on some,
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.540]   that's something that they'd consider the tourist path
[00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.460]   or whatever that you actually,
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.580]   they wanna steer you somewhere else.
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.660]   People are very passionate about where they're from.
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.180]   So tapping into that.
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.060]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.780]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.220]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm your host,
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.940]   and I'm excited you're here today.
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.580]   And if you're listening to this podcast right now,
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.180]   you probably love to travel,
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.260]   and you don't need me to tell you
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.060]   how great an experience it is.
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.300]   I'm gonna keep doing it anyways,
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.320]   and so is to our guest today, Sebastian Modak.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.380]   He's a writer and a multimedia journalist based in New York,
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.980]   but he grew up all over the world
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.660]   and has since traveled to even more destinations.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.620]   In fact, if you know that amazing
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.980]   New York Times 52 places list that comes out each year,
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.900]   well, in 2019, Sebastian sent his entire year
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.820]   going to all 52 places.
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.460]   Well, except one, but we'll get to that later.
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.540]   He's now the editor-in-large at Lonely Planet
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.660]   and still writes about travel for publications
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.580]   like the New York Times, CondÃ© Nast Traveler, and more.
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.820]   We're gonna talk about what he's learned
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.140]   from living in four different continents,
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.300]   traveling to 80 plus countries,
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.660]   what he thinks it means to travel like a journalist,
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.020]   and how he uses those skills to plan a memorable trip,
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.760]   some of the unusual experiences he's had on his journeys,
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.700]   why he thinks travel is important for everyone,
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.900]   and finally, we're both gonna share
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.340]   some of our favorite places to give you some inspiration
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.800]   for your next adventure.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.420]   Sebastian, welcome to the show.
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.640]   - Thanks for having me, happy to be here.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.220]   - You've probably spent more time traveling
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.200]   than almost anyone listening,
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.720]   so I'm curious just to kick us off
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.020]   what you think most people are probably getting wrong.
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.140]   What could people be doing totally differently
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.420]   in the way they travel?
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.960]   - I think it starts before you even get on a plane
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.940]   or before you travel,
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.060]   and I think what's missing a lot of the times,
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.700]   myself included in the past,
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.540]   and that's something I've been trying
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.760]   to be more conscious of going forward,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.680]   is the why of travel.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.640]   I think we've nailed the what, we've even nailed the how.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.780]   You wanna go somewhere
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.420]   because your friend has told you about it
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.580]   and it's great, whatever,
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.780]   but are you really thinking deeply
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.560]   about how you're gonna engage with the place
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.580]   when you're on the ground?
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.140]   Is this really just a bragging rights trip?
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.700]   Is this because you saw an oversaturated photo on Instagram
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.340]   and you wanna get the same photo?
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.940]   Maybe that is the way that you start getting interest
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.160]   in a place and you start getting the idea of traveling,
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.540]   but if that's the be all and end all,
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.780]   you're kind of missing the point,
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.660]   and especially now, I think,
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.140]   when you have to measure your travel decisions
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.820]   against things like your carbon footprint
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.200]   and the public health issues
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.260]   that now surround travel with COVID and everything else,
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.700]   you have all these other things to balance and measure out.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.420]   Now, more than ever, I think you need to be like,
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.100]   okay, why am I really going on this trip
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.240]   and how am I gonna act once I hit the ground?
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.180]   And I think that's really where people need to start more
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.460]   versus like, where am I gonna go?
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.820]   It's why am I gonna go and then taking it from there.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.220]   I think that's when you really start building
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.300]   a rewarding trip that's gonna give you
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.740]   these rewarding experiences that are gonna last a lifetime.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.780]   - What are some examples of good whys
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.900]   you've heard from people about why they're traveling
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.460]   or why they're going to a specific place?
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.020]   - From solo travelers, for example,
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.820]   the why might be they wanna make some new friends
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.140]   and they wanna go to a place where they can really interact
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.440]   with people and meet locals and learn.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.540]   I think that's a great example of getting the right why.
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.260]   And I've known many people who have asked me that question,
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.820]   starting with like, where should I go
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.380]   if I want to really immerse myself in a place
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.460]   and immerse myself in maybe it's a language,
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.220]   maybe it's a cuisine, maybe it's a music scene
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.260]   or whatever else.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.480]   And that being a why I think is gonna just immediately lead
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.900]   to like the serendipitous life-changing encounters
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.940]   that we all really hope to have traveling.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.620]   I can give you an example of a trip
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.580]   that I'm in the middle of planning right now.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.420]   I got married recently and we're having our honeymoon.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.860]   And in thinking about our honeymoon, we started with a why.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.700]   We didn't start with a where.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.180]   We didn't start with, oh, we need to go to the Amalfi Coast
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.380]   or Hawaii or whatever else.
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.380]   And there's nothing wrong with those.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.000]   Those are popular honeymoon destinations for a reason.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.660]   But we were like, okay, we wanna go somewhere
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.060]   where we can do something active, something outdoors,
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.660]   not push ourselves too hard, not have to like over-plan it
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.200]   because we still do want it to be a honeymoon
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.380]   where we can relax and enjoy each other's company,
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.740]   but also maybe experience something new.
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.060]   And that brought us to Slovenia
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.220]   and this incredible network of bike routes
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.580]   that Slovenia has put out over the last couple of years.
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.980]   And so I sort of poured over those.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.180]   And then I found one that's like this gourmet focused route
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.620]   where you're like stopping in restaurants
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.980]   and you're riding through wine country
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.460]   and you're really learning about the local cuisine
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.180]   and you're staying at certified sustainable hotels
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.020]   and guest houses and you're doing it all on a bike.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.300]   So you're sustainable in that way.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.300]   It was just all of a sudden, it's just opened up this trip
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.980]   that I had no idea even existed.
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.100]   And even as a travel journalist,
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.540]   I didn't know it was possible.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.860]   And it all started with us just being like,
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.660]   where can we go that's like a little unexpected,
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.760]   but is also gonna give us, challenge us a bit,
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.100]   but isn't gonna be like grueling 70 miles days on a bike,
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.340]   but it's gonna be like 20 to 30 mile days instead.
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.700]   And we'll end with a glass of wine and a good meal
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.680]   and a nice bed and breakfast.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.660]   And we landed on Slovenia.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.180]   So it's like, that's I think just one example
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.640]   of starting with the like, what am I looking for?
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.020]   And then going to the place instead of being like,
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.540]   man, everyone's been to Italy, but me,
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.980]   I need to go to Italy immediately, you know?
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.860]   - Yeah, I've heard amazing things about Slovenia
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.700]   and haven't been.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.940]   So I wanna get the recap when you're back, but-
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.840]   - For sure.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.240]   - There's not like an obvious filter, right?
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.460]   If you wanna search for a hotel, you're like,
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.020]   well, I want it to be four stars.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.340]   I want it to have a pool.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.500]   I want it to be within this distance of the city center.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.340]   But when you took those criteria and you were like,
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.100]   you know, I would love to have a glass of wine
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.700]   at the end of the day, do something active.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.100]   How did you end up to Slovenia?
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.580]   Like maybe it's the wealth of knowledge you've built,
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.060]   but how would the average person take this idea of a why
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.460]   and an experience they want and actually arrive at a place?
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.940]   - So there's something, not to do the whole corporate plug,
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.260]   but there's something we talk about at Lonely Planet a lot
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.760]   in terms of like giving guidance to people,
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.780]   which is the bread and butter of what something
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.080]   like Lonely Planet does is travel guidance,
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.080]   is that you want to be their most knowledgeable friend,
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.460]   right?
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.800]   You don't want to be necessarily just like,
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.340]   we're an authority, we're going to tell you what to do.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.900]   You want to be that friend who's like,
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.740]   oh, what are you into?
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.760]   Oh, you got to try this and this and this,
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.380]   because like, this is, I totally know that you're into this.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.980]   And so you're going to really enjoy this.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.980]   And so for me, I'm lucky to have this very extended network
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.340]   of travel writers and travel creators and all this stuff.
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.500]   So for me, like those were my friends.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.340]   And I started just kind of asking around.
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.660]   I would see the articles that were coming
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.020]   through the pipeline at Lonely Planet.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.340]   I would see like some people writing
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.940]   about cycling in Slovenia.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.780]   That would make me go down some rabbit hole
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.240]   of all these different green routes.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.580]   And so it was really just like the kind of research
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.460]   that I think most travelers enjoy,
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.900]   is that kind of research where you get like a little tip
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.340]   and you follow that down a rabbit hole.
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.220]   And you're like, oh, okay, so maybe not, you know,
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.420]   like it brought me down a rabbit hole looking
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.340]   at like Provence and Bordeaux and all this stuff.
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.180]   And I was like, oh, that's like,
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.020]   maybe just like a little too crowded for what we want.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.140]   We want to have more space.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.260]   We want to feel like we're more embedded in local life.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.540]   So we started looking at cases like,
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.240]   okay, if not France, if not Italy, just look at a map.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.480]   Like, okay, Slovenia is right there.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.380]   What's going on in Slovenia?
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.760]   So it's really just this like endless game,
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.120]   this kind of scavenger hunt where you're taking
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.500]   on little tips, you're doing your own research
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.840]   and you're landing on something that feels right.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.720]   But at least you've started somewhere beyond
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.560]   just like a bucket list, you know?
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.880]   - Yeah, we're going to come back to bucket lists
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.520]   'cause we had a fun conversation about that before.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.880]   But I'm curious, is there like a Lonely Planet
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.360]   or another source of like the world guidebook
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.760]   where it's like, you know, a page or so
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.300]   and about each country where you can kind of just start
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.860]   to like wet your palate on different places?
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.000]   Or I know Lonely Planet, I don't know if you still do,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.620]   but they used to have this thorn tree forum online
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.360]   where you could go ask questions.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.880]   Anything in that realm of kind of broader inspiration?
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.520]   Obviously, you know, if you knew Slovenia,
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.320]   you could go get a guidebook about Slovenia
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.160]   and get the inspiration.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.320]   But if you didn't know Slovenia, you know,
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   do you start with a continent or any ideas there?
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.960]   - Yeah, I mean, there is actually
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.320]   a Lonely Planet world book.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.660]   I actually don't know the last time we put it out,
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.500]   but I've seen it before.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.160]   It's this huge thick doorstopper of a volume
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.740]   that's just like an overview of the world.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.000]   I wouldn't necessarily recommend that.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.400]   It's a big read to start going through.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.160]   I mean, for better or for worse,
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.620]   I do think social media is a huge part of it.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.000]   And it takes a little bit of your own work, I think,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.720]   to filter through all the BS, so to speak,
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.440]   and the surface level stuff and the oversaturated photos
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.080]   and the influencer shots on the beach
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.480]   that aren't really telling you anything about the place.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.000]   But once you get past that,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.280]   you can find some really incredible information
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.140]   on social media, just regular people out and about
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.460]   who put a Slovenia hashtag on something, or maybe not.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.460]   Maybe they put a bike touring hashtag.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.080]   And you're looking at the bike touring hashtag
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.160]   'cause you're interested in doing something with bikes.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.400]   And you're like, where is this?
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.000]   Like, where is this person like drinking a glass of wine,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.680]   looking at this beautiful valley
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.820]   with a bike in the background?
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.380]   Oh, it's Slovenia, huh, really?
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.560]   So I think like searching kind of subject areas
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.360]   in social media is sort of the digital equivalent
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.140]   of hanging out at a bar with the entire world
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.080]   and asking for recommendations, you know?
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.460]   And it means you got to comb through some garbage
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.000]   to get to the good stuff, but it's in there.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.820]   And it's the most, like the really genuine,
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.160]   from the heart, personal stuff
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.620]   that when you get to those recommendations,
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.560]   I think they mean a lot.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.080]   I do it even as a journalist.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.920]   If I'm like interested in seeing
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.720]   where people are bike touring
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.000]   or where people are backpacking or hiking,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.360]   like I'll search those hashtags.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.760]   I'll follow those accounts on, you know,
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.160]   TikTok and Instagram or whatever,
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.340]   and just see where people are hanging out
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.040]   and what people are talking about.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.420]   'Cause for better or for worse, it is a pulse,
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.640]   and you're looking for a pulse,
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.080]   and you're looking for a trend, and it's there.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.740]   So I think that's one way.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.560]   I think, you know, what I like to do is,
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.880]   yeah, starting with a continent, maybe.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.000]   Maybe you're like, okay, Europe,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.920]   I want to do a trip in Europe,
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.260]   but maybe I'm thinking beyond Spain, Italy, France.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.600]   Just like look at a map and pick a country
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.320]   and be like, oh, Albania, like what's going on in Albania?
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.360]   And then you can start looking there,
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.680]   and maybe something's gonna interest you.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.560]   Maybe it won't.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.380]   Maybe you'll be like, okay,
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.640]   this looks a little too rough for me.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.640]   I need something with more infrastructure.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.000]   And then you look west and you're like,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   okay, maybe one of these, you know,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.920]   maybe Croatia, maybe Slovenia, maybe Czech Republic.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.520]   And just like looking at a physical map
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.080]   and like dreaming about it a little bit.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.000]   'Cause I know we'll probably get to this later,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.640]   but I am of the firm belief that everywhere,
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.400]   literally everywhere, has something to offer
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.600]   if you open yourself up to it.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.720]   It has something that's gonna blow your mind.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.880]   If you spend a little time,
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.640]   if you approach it with an open mind,
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.480]   you'll find something that's gonna blow your mind,
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.680]   even in your own backyard.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.520]   I live two blocks from Prospect Park in Brooklyn.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.280]   If I go into Prospect Park today
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.080]   with the mindset that like I'm looking to be educated,
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.920]   I'm looking to learn,
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.160]   I'm looking to have my mind expanded,
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.520]   I'm gonna have some interaction,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.920]   whether it's, you know,
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.560]   staring at a cardinal for 20 minutes
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.160]   or watching a couple hanging out on the lawn
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.400]   or, you know, playing with a random dog
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.800]   that's gonna like make me feel good
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.080]   and make me feel fulfilled.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.480]   And I really firmly believe
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.000]   that it really starts with mindset,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.120]   which loops all back to that idea of like,
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.720]   why are you traveling?
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.360]   And if you go in with the right mindset,
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.200]   it doesn't matter.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.840]   Honestly, it doesn't really matter where you're going.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.080]   You're gonna have your mind blown in some way.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.440]   - So I wanna dig into that process.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.320]   But before I wanna mention,
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.160]   well, I don't know if the average listener
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.000]   is thinking of Reddit as social media.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.160]   I wanna plug it because I use it a lot for travel.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.880]   And I just did one quick search and I said,
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.160]   you know, European wine tour site colon reddit.com.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.760]   And it's like crowdsourcing my wine tasting trip to Europe.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.400]   Who's got suggestions?
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.840]   There aren't a lot of comments, unfortunately.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.760]   But the person who wrote it
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.200]   came up with all these suggestions
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.680]   that include Slovenia and Croatia and Alto Adige,
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.760]   which I don't even know where that is.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.600]   - Alto Adige, yeah.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.760]   It's like Northern Italy, I think, yeah.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.640]   - So this at least had a bunch of suggestions,
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.800]   even though there weren't a lot of comments.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.160]   So I use that a lot.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.000]   - I do too.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.120]   And actually it's a great example.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.760]   I, during the pandemic,
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.960]   I feel like you're gonna end this podcast
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.360]   being like this guy's obsessed with bikes.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.360]   Like shut up about bikes.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.160]   But I like went down serious rabbit hole
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.080]   with cycling and bike, especially bike travel.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.720]   Like I'm not really interested in the, you know,
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.200]   head to toe Lycra racing stuff.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.360]   Like I'm, I love traveling by bike
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.920]   'cause I think it like slows you down.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.560]   You really get to notice a lot.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.440]   It's just a great way to like feel,
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.280]   get the feel of the place.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.320]   But I really went down a rabbit hole during the pandemic
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.960]   because I was stuck at home like everyone else.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.160]   I don't, I live in New York City.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.360]   I don't own a car.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.000]   So I was like looking at ways to tap into this idea
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.520]   of adventure and travel while still being close to home
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.080]   and doing it with the tools that I had,
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.280]   which was a bicycle.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.000]   And Reddit was like a goldmine for that kind of stuff.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.920]   I just, as an example,
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.920]   I remember finding someone talking about the route vert,
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.320]   butchering that French, but it means the green route.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.400]   And it's like a network of trails
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.440]   and routes in Quebec and Canada.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.880]   Never would have thought of it.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.040]   Like my knowledge and desire and understanding of Quebec
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.200]   starts and ends with Montreal, like it has for a long time.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.640]   And then suddenly reading about this network
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.400]   of hundreds and hundreds of miles of trails
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.560]   that exist in Quebec,
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.280]   started talking to my partner and we're like,
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.320]   you know, I hear the border's about to reopen with Canada.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.960]   What if we just went and did this trip
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.400]   that I like saw on Reddit?
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.600]   And we're like, okay, well, we don't have a car,
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.040]   but what if we took the train with our bikes
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.640]   as far North as it goes
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.960]   and then got on our bikes from there
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.560]   and rode across the border into Canada
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.080]   and did the trip that way,
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.360]   which is exactly what we ended up doing.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.120]   We took the train to St. Albans, Vermont,
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.960]   literally spent the night in Vermont,
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.560]   left that morning, rode to Canada,
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.600]   and then spent a week riding around Quebec
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.720]   and then rode back to Vermont and took the train home,
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.960]   all without ever getting in the car.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.800]   I wrote about it on Lonely Planet's website actually,
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.040]   but it's a great example of something
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.240]   that just like started with like a tiny little spark
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.360]   of being like, huh, the green route Quebec,
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.640]   like sounds kind of magical.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.000]   Like, I wonder if we could do it.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.800]   Next thing I know, a few weeks later,
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.720]   we're on a train with our bikes on our way up to Canada.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.960]   So that just goes to show, I think,
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.400]   like how the germ of something,
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.400]   if you have the right curiosity and the right mindset,
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.560]   could turn into like a really great adventure.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.200]   - I think there's two things to take away there
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.040]   that you didn't mention.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.640]   One, I imagine that was a pretty inexpensive trip
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.000]   for something you describe.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.960]   You describe it in a way that people talk about
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.600]   these once-in-a-lifetime adventures
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.240]   that they plan for years and years
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.160]   and they spend thousands of dollars.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.320]   That doesn't sound like something
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.080]   that took a lot of advanced notice
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.200]   or a lot of money to make happen.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.680]   - We didn't know where we were staying every night.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.000]   Like it was one of those kinds of trips.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.520]   And it was amazing 'cause you could do that
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.400]   in a place like Quebec.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.680]   We'd be like, oh, we're starting to get a little tired.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.880]   We've been riding for 60 miles.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.640]   It looks like a storm's coming in.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.600]   Pull out my phone and be like,
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.960]   what's the nearest bed and breakfast?
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.800]   Give 'em a call.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.080]   They're like, yeah, of course, come on through.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.120]   Next thing you know, we're staying there.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.760]   So, and I think that's a great point that you make
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.360]   that like, one, that these kind of big,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.240]   this is actually the point that I make in my story too,
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.080]   where like you think of like the capital B, capital T,
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.000]   big trip as something that you spend years
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.720]   thinking about, planning every moment.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.720]   You know, you're gonna go on a safari.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.200]   You're gonna go climb to Everest Base Camp.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.360]   You're gonna do these huge things, which is great.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.560]   And those have a place
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.280]   and those kind of big goals are important.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.760]   But what this taught me at least was that
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.160]   a big trip can come from like a small idea.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.880]   A big trip can be something that is largely improvised.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.960]   It can be serendipitous, can be spontaneous.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.160]   Again, I really do think it comes down to mindset.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.680]   I think we could have gone into that
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.920]   panicking about not having a place to stay,
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.480]   tired, you know, we got rained on,
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.880]   we had flat tires, all this stuff.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.440]   But because we had the attitude where we're like,
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.640]   this is an adventure, like what?
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.320]   This is like, we've been cooped up at home
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.920]   for a year and a half 'cause of the pandemic.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.640]   And now we're out here doing this amazing thing.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.480]   Like how lucky are we?
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.040]   And because we came in with that attitude,
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.800]   it just turned into like a really fulfilling,
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.240]   if exhausting adventure.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.000]   - You know, it was kind of in your backyard per se, right?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.080]   It wasn't directly there, but you took a train,
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.360]   you didn't have to cross an ocean,
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.320]   you didn't have to spend thousands on plane tickets.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.840]   So, you know, I think a lot of times
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.560]   everyone plans vacations like, gosh, where can I go?
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.120]   That's, you know, halfway around the world.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.680]   And it's cool to hear that, you know,
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.520]   if you just think about it, you might find something,
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.000]   you know, not too far away.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.040]   - Absolutely.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.760]   - When we first spoke a few months ago,
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.560]   you kind of said, oh, I think people should think about
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.080]   how you to approach a trip like a journalist might,
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.160]   about the people you'll meet,
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.960]   how to approach it with an open mind.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.280]   So we talked about mindset.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.480]   We talked about the feeling you want to get,
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.400]   a little bit about where you want to go,
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.280]   but I kind of want to just break down.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.080]   Let's say someone listening has gone through these steps
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.240]   and is planning a trip.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.920]   I'd love to just go back and forth
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.920]   and talk about some of the things you do.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.760]   So let's say we've now picked a place.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.720]   Let's say we have decided the why
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.440]   and we know why we're going.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.120]   What kind of research do you think
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.480]   people should be doing in advance
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.640]   versus leaving up to that serendipity
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.840]   you described earlier?
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.880]   - What I like to do is,
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.280]   so I'm just going to give you an example
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.000]   of from the 52 places trip I did,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.480]   because I mean, I think it's very out of the ordinary,
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.400]   of course, but I think there's a lot
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.320]   that can be learned for it.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.120]   One of the things was that I,
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.520]   because I was going to 52 places in 52 weeks,
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.480]   I didn't have time to prepare, right?
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.160]   I luckily had someone at the times who was helping me
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.840]   and she would send me like a really great,
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.560]   like one pager of like,
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.000]   here's what you need to know about currency
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.840]   and here's what you need to know
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.440]   about public transportation.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.800]   And here's like the top 10 things to do
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.040]   when you Google the place, right?
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.040]   Like these are the big tourist hits or whatever.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.520]   I would try to like knock out those 10 things
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.600]   in like an afternoon and be like,
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.400]   okay, so I've done the brass tacks.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.440]   I've seen that now, like,
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.240]   let me actually have an experience, you know?
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.080]   And I think that goes back to this idea
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.600]   of like travel being more serendipitous,
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.640]   more spontaneous, more connective than it is extractive.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.800]   I think a lot of the times we think of travel as extractive
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.000]   where it's like, I need to go in there,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.840]   get things that make me fulfilled and leave
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.640]   and that's, and wash my hands of it
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.560]   and plan the next trip.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.560]   And I think leaving things open has been,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.680]   has always led to the best experiences.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.120]   In terms of preparation, like, yeah, have a place to stay.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.880]   If it's city-based, find a place to stay.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.720]   I think beforehand, if you can go as local as possible.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.800]   And I don't mean Airbnb.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.520]   I mean, Airbnb is fine if that's what you wanna do.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.600]   But I think there's nothing better than staying
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.200]   at like a family run bed and breakfast.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.600]   I think it's the best, you know,
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.160]   bathrooms down the hall, you know,
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.800]   dad's making you breakfast in the morning.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.720]   Mom's giving you tips of where to go shopping.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.400]   You know, like that vibe, I think opens up so much
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.560]   just in terms of local recommendations,
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.960]   in terms of the feeling of being a local,
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.920]   in terms of supporting local economies,
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.200]   you're staying at like a family run hotel
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.680]   versus the Hilton or whatever.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.160]   Like, I think goes a long way
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.480]   in terms of where you're putting your money.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.760]   So I think that's a great place to start.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.040]   I've had incredible experiences literally just from,
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.120]   you know, an innkeeper in Bulgaria
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.960]   who over the course of five days of me staying there
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.000]   kind of gains my trust.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.800]   And all of a sudden he's showing me old family photos
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.920]   and he's showing me into the basement
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.960]   where there's like a fresco on the wall
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.840]   from like the Ottoman times.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.240]   And he like keeps it under, like behind glass
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.080]   'cause it's like his greatest possession now.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.960]   And it's in this house that he's owned
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.160]   and his family has owned.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.920]   So just like these experiences that you unlock
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.080]   by like going local, by going small.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.320]   I feel like you didn't ask me where you should stay,
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.320]   but I do think that is kind of where most people start.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.520]   And I think thinking even the why
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.960]   in that decision goes a long way.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.760]   You could just look at TripAdvisor
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.600]   and go with the one with the most reviews with five stars,
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.480]   but then you're just kind of doing what everyone else did.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.480]   - Right.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.160]   And is there a time and a place sometimes
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.320]   for staying in like the city center,
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.360]   being really close to things?
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.800]   I don't know if the, you know,
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.000]   kind of bed and breakfast are always
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.800]   kind of located in that area, but-
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.720]   - You know, maybe you do both.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.520]   Maybe you do the rural bed and breakfast
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.360]   for a couple of days,
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.040]   and then you stay in the middle of the city
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.360]   where you're not really gonna be spending time
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.280]   at the hotel anyway.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.720]   But I think to go back to kind of what my first steps are
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.320]   in feeling that I'm connected to a place,
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.840]   what I learned to do pretty quickly on my reporting trips
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.960]   is that, and I think it's reporting specific,
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.680]   but I think it's general tips for travel too,
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.240]   is when I get to a place, especially if it's a city,
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.040]   first thing I do is I leave the camera in the hotel room.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.000]   I put the phone away in my pocket and I just walk.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.640]   I'll give myself like an hour and a half, maybe two hours,
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.280]   no destination in mind.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.880]   I just want to get the pulse of the place.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.000]   I just want to feel it.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.280]   And maybe I'll get distracted and like sit down for a beer
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.080]   and watch the city go by that way,
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.760]   or a coffee or sit in a park for a little bit,
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.240]   but I just want to be there.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.440]   And that means not looking at my phone.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.440]   The great thing about Google Maps
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.400]   is that you can get completely lost
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.160]   and then use it to find your way back, right?
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.560]   So I just like, if I think a street looks interesting,
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.480]   I'll walk down that.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.560]   If I see a scene happening at the local park,
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.400]   I'll sit down and watch that for 20 minutes.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.520]   If I strike up a conversation with someone,
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.680]   I'll let that go and see where it takes me.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.000]   But it's just such a small thing,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.920]   but it goes such a long way.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.960]   If you're just thinking like,
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.560]   of course you're going to want to document things.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.560]   You're going to want to post things to Instagram.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.840]   You're going to want to share it with friends,
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.880]   all this stuff, but just like wait a couple of hours.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.800]   Do it starting that evening.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.240]   Give yourself at least a few hours
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.240]   to feel like you're there and you're in the place.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.600]   And maybe you'll see places where you're like,
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.680]   oh, I need to come back and photograph that.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.840]   I need to come back during sunset
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.240]   'cause I bet the photographs here are great then
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.080]   or whatever else that you need to do.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.800]   And I'm thinking of that professionally, of course,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.440]   as a photographer and a writer,
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.360]   but I think everyone's into documenting their trips.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   So everyone's thinking of that.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.040]   But if you give yourself time to just be,
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:18.960]   it's really amazing how much better you get the place.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.000]   You understand it and you feel it in a way that you don't,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.640]   again, if you're just like extracting content from it
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.720]   from the moment you hit the ground.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.560]   - You didn't mention this,
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.040]   but one thing I like to do is where possible
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.780]   and where not ridiculously inconvenient,
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.760]   get to wherever you're going using public transportation
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.880]   when you first arrive.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.160]   Taking the train, taking a bus.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.240]   You see people in their normal environment
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.840]   versus if you were to take a taxi
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.840]   or call an Uber in another country,
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.160]   you're just kind of sitting in the back, just moving.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.280]   So I feel like your trip starts sooner when you do that.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.280]   - And I think it's, yeah,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.720]   public transportation is a great tip.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.160]   I think you really get to know a place.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.880]   There's cities that I know geographically
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.880]   through their subway maps versus their actual maps.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.120]   I know that this stop is here and this stop is here
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.080]   and that's my understanding of geography.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.160]   And I think it's something that as people get older
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.720]   and as people have more money and all these things,
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.640]   you stop doing that.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.840]   Like when you're a backpacker
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.640]   and you're living off the $20 in your pocket,
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.520]   you're taking public transportation or walking
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.800]   because you're not about to drop half your budget
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.200]   on a taxi, right?
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.080]   Now I think, at least for me who's older and whatever,
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.280]   it's much easier for me to be like,
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.520]   I'll just take an Uber.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.400]   But if you force yourself to,
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.500]   there's a lot we can learn from our early days of travel,
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.600]   backpacking and whatever else when you're pinching pennies,
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.120]   including the fact that like,
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.000]   yeah, public transportation is gonna save you money,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.040]   but it also like, you just get to understand,
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.480]   you're seeing the places in between.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.520]   You're seeing the kind of people that come on
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.960]   on certain stops and go off and get off at certain stops.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.840]   You're like, you get a really better understanding
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.440]   of the place just by getting on a train or a bus
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.960]   or like in South Africa, the combis,
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.980]   the little mini vans that go around.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.520]   You just get such a better understanding
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.640]   and people will help you too.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.580]   And that's another thing that I think it's intimidating.
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.180]   Of course it is, but if you're lost, people will help you.
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:16.180]   I remember trying to find my way around the metro system
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.420]   in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, which is incredible.
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.480]   I mean, in the case of like former Soviet countries,
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.540]   take the subway just to see the metro stations,
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.920]   they're like works of art, it's unreal.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.240]   So I'm taking the metro around in Tashkent
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.440]   and I was just so confused.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.560]   I was like, I didn't understand the maps.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.020]   I was sitting there with like,
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:40.000]   two handfuls of coins and bills,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.160]   just like unsure about the denominations.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.120]   I was jet lagged and someone like saw me immediately
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.600]   and came up to me and like, in broken English was like,
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.440]   where are you trying to go?
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.240]   I like, I said the name of the stop
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.680]   and just held out my hands with all the coins in it.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.520]   And he just like picked out what I needed,
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.080]   put it in the machine, gave me the ticket
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:56.920]   and led me on my way.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.840]   You know, it's like, put your trust in someone,
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.080]   someone's gonna help you out.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.680]   And just that interaction too, like I still remember it
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.920]   and I'll remember it probably forever.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.860]   Just that small interaction that you're not gonna get
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.520]   if you just call an Uber.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.760]   - Yeah, those things happen.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.600]   So we had the same thing happen in Aleppo, Syria.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.700]   We got into the city, we took a taxi from Turkey
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.760]   and we, which fun fact, taxis from Turkey,
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.960]   I mean, I'm sure this is different now,
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.320]   but taxis from Turkey to Syria,
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.240]   because gas was like 10% of the cost, right?
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.480]   It was so cheap, the taxis would go for free almost.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.040]   It was like, you know, the cost to go from Turkey to Syria
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.880]   was almost nothing as long as you had no bags
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.380]   because there were special taxis
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.640]   where their entire trunk was just gas tanks.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.400]   And so you would go into Syria and it would be super cheap,
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.000]   but you'd get dropped off and we had,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.440]   we were staying couch surfing in a suburb
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.920]   and we had no clue what we were doing.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.960]   And a random person came up who spoke no English,
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.320]   but kind of got the sense that we were lost,
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.580]   called someone, handed me the phone.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.920]   So just a stranger's handing me a cell phone
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.320]   and I answer it and this person says,
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.280]   "Hey, you don't know me,
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.160]   "but my brother says he thinks you're lost."
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.320]   So he called me and if you want,
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.060]   I can, you can tell me where you're going,
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.140]   I'll tell him and he can help you get there.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.700]   But he would love if you stopped by his house
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.800]   and have some tea first.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.240]   So like, it was this experience that I think many people
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.760]   could just not be open to or think it's scary.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.600]   And I wanna get at some point to,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.400]   before we stop to talk about, you know,
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.800]   risk and safety and that kind of stuff.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.280]   But being open to those things
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.680]   has been some of the best experiences we have.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.720]   So, before we get there, what are you bringing?
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.320]   Like, we don't need to go down to how many pairs of socks,
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.120]   people can figure that out on their own,
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.060]   but are there perspectives you have
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.740]   that are unique or contrarian about things to bring
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.900]   or, you know, I never bring a roller board,
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.420]   I always bring a duffel bag or just things
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.340]   that might spark some interesting thoughts
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.580]   in people listening?
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.580]   - I'm not like the militant, carry on only
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.420]   school of thought.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.700]   I mean, maybe now I might be with the amount of,
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.440]   with the mess that's going on at airports
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.940]   and bags getting lost or whatever.
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.180]   But I remember getting into, I mean,
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.460]   this is the closest things,
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.820]   closest my work has gotten to being a controversy.
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.320]   When I got that 52 places job,
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.880]   I posted something about how I had like decided I needed,
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.860]   I was just gonna check in a bag for the year.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.940]   And of course, travel Twitter just blows up.
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.340]   They're like, oh my God, you call yourself a traveler?
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.580]   Like, if you can't get all your belongings in a carry on,
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.340]   you don't actually know how to travel.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.560]   And I was just like, shut up.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.620]   Like everyone has, people can do their own thing.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.060]   People have their own styles.
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:39.020]   I had to pack for Siberia and Tahiti in the same suitcase.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.900]   Like it's not, I just didn't want the stress
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.580]   of having to do laundry every four days or whatever.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.420]   So I did it.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.760]   The bag got lost twice, but found its way back to me.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.220]   So it was fine.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.660]   But I tell that story to say like,
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:58.460]   I'm not dogmatic about packing in any way.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.100]   I bring, oftentimes it's happening half an hour
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.220]   before I'm heading to the airport
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.780]   and I'm just throwing in whatever I feel like.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.980]   I think there are things that I swear by now.
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.620]   Like it's hard to find anything in my travel wardrobe
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.540]   that's not made of Merino wool.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.920]   'Cause I think the stuff is magical.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.700]   It keeps you warm when it's cold.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.260]   It cools you down when it's hot.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:22.700]   I've worn it in like, in the Gambia
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.880]   during the hottest, rainiest time of year.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.820]   Like the same t-shirt four days in a row
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.880]   and it still didn't smell.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.460]   Like it's just, the stuff is witchcraft.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.020]   It's unreal.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.940]   So like now that's something I definitely learned
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:33.940]   through long-term travel.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.580]   And now I completely swear by is Merino wool.
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.760]   - Where are you getting all of these Merino wool products?
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.940]   Is there a brand or?
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.140]   - Smartwool is great.
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.460]   They make, Smartwool makes some great stuff.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.660]   I have a lot of stuff from then.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.820]   Fjallraven, it's all like performance stuff.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.780]   It's like, you're like spending, I don't know,
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.540]   $180 on a t-shirt and you're like,
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.860]   "Really, $80 on a t-shirt?"
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.540]   But if you only have to bring two t-shirts with you,
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.380]   it's pretty good.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.220]   So yeah, I had like one lightweight Merino wool
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.940]   and one heavier weight one.
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.460]   And like, that was basically all I wore for a year.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.620]   So that I really swear by.
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.860]   Packing cubes, I also swear by.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.760]   I think a lot of people have come onto the,
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.220]   entered the church of packing cubes,
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.980]   but I think being organized that way
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.900]   really has upped my travel game
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.860]   'cause I just don't leave things behind anymore
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.340]   because I know everything has a place
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.900]   and I know where everything goes.
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.640]   And if I feel that a packing cube isn't as full as it was
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.140]   when I got there, I know something's,
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.580]   my bathing suit's hanging in the bathroom
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.260]   or something's been left behind.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.620]   So that in terms of organization.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.060]   And also just like,
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.100]   like there's very few loose items in my bags.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.780]   I know I said like I'm not dogmatic about things
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.180]   and then now I've gone into being like,
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.100]   "No loose items in the backpack."
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.940]   But no, it's true.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.860]   I have like pouches for everything.
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.460]   All my tech stuff is in one bag,
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.220]   all my camera gears in another bag inside the bag.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.620]   So I just know where, you know.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.820]   And also when I inevitably get pulled aside at security,
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.140]   both because of all the electronics in my bag,
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:02.200]   but also for being a brown dude in the 21st century,
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.620]   you know, always the random security check happens.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.740]   Then I can just open the bag
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.180]   and I've got four other bags I take out
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.180]   instead of an explosion of cables and other gear.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:16.460]   So yeah, those are kind of my main constants.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.740]   Everything else is, you know,
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.860]   if I feel like bringing, you know,
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.260]   a extra pair of head, like earphones for working out
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.100]   or whatever, I'll do that.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.180]   Sometimes I won't.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:27.780]   You know, all the other stuff is kind of up in the air,
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:32.380]   but those are my hard and fast, my hard rules.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.220]   - I don't know if you followed
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.180]   the new church of in packing for travelers,
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.180]   but it seems to be putting an AirTag,
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.100]   an Apple AirTag in like every device or every bag.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.820]   And I have not checked a bag
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.140]   since kind of going down this rabbit hole,
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.700]   but it seems like most people that have lost a bag
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.380]   that have had an Apple AirTag in it
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.540]   have somehow been able to figure out where it is
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:54.580]   and get it back.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.420]   - That's interesting.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.060]   I mean, I just, I wonder how that plays out though,
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.100]   because you're, you know,
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.980]   especially now that all these airlines are overwhelmed.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.660]   Is it that you're going up to them and you're like,
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.820]   you're saying you can't find my bag?
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.660]   I see it.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.620]   It's at LAX or whatever.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.460]   And then what?
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.300]   What are they supposed to do?
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.120]   They're not gonna, they're gonna be like,
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:10.960]   okay, sure, sure, sure.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.620]   And then they'll go do whatever process
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.460]   they were gonna do.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.500]   I don't know if they're gonna go out of their way
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.140]   because you can show them where the bag is.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:17.980]   I don't know.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.580]   - Well, I've seen, I've read multiple stories of people
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.660]   where the bag made it.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.780]   Let's say you're flying to Denver,
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.440]   the bag's in Denver and they're like,
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.280]   we don't know where it is.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.740]   And you're like, well, actually I know where it is
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.720]   in the airport.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.160]   Now, if you're in Denver and the flight came from London
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.760]   and you're like, I know where it is in London,
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.000]   you're probably out of luck and you're gonna have to wait.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.720]   You might be able to say, look, I know it's in London.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.560]   Can you get it?
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.880]   But to the extent that the bag is lost,
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.140]   maybe it's coming a day late.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.040]   You kind of know where it is.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.600]   You have some idea or even just figuring out
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.440]   when it's coming.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.040]   Sometimes they're like, when the bag gets here,
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.320]   we'll deliver it to you.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.960]   And you're like, well, at least now I know it's here.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.800]   - It's here, yeah.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.940]   - Or I know that it made it on the plane, right?
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.500]   You land and you're sitting there like,
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.180]   oh man, the bags are coming off.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.540]   I haven't seen it, I haven't seen it.
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.020]   Some airlines are getting really good.
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.060]   I can't remember whether it was United or Delta
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.900]   or something.
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.940]   I looked in the app and it was like,
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.020]   we scanned your bag at the check-in.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.980]   We scanned your bag when it's getting on the plane.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.060]   Obviously, if you could get that level of detail
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.540]   with every airline, it would be unnecessary.
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.900]   But I think people have really liked being able
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.180]   to at least have a sense of where is my bag?
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.140]   Like, is it actually here?
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.260]   Is it coming?
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.700]   If I see that it's still where I took off,
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.220]   I'm not gonna sit at the baggage carousel
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.380]   for 45 minutes to see if maybe it's coming.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.220]   I kinda, I know it's not here.
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.380]   - But you know it's not coming.
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.380]   Yeah, no, I can see the appeal.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.300]   I'm trying to, like, for the trips that I have coming up,
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:37.140]   I'm trying to go carry on just 'cause I've heard
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.660]   about this, all the chaos.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.340]   But then you run into stuff where you just have to,
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.900]   like, you don't wanna sacrifice.
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.460]   Like, I just did a trip in the Faroe Islands
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:48.460]   where I was hiking for a week, basically, straight.
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.340]   And it was pretty intense hiking.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.340]   So, like, I wanted to bring trekking poles.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.060]   You can't carry on trekking poles.
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.900]   So, it's like, okay, do I not bring trekking poles
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.020]   and be miserable, or do I just bring 'em and check 'em in
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.860]   and run the risk of not having 'em when I get there?
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.860]   And I chose the latter, and I had the trekking poles.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.540]   So, there's decisions you have to make,
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.620]   and I'll probably go on the side of comfort
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:14.620]   over any kind of hard rules around packing every time.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.500]   - Yeah, and there are things.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.900]   I mean, trekking poles may or may not be as easy,
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:23.700]   but in some places, now that we have children,
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.300]   I've noticed there are sites, definitely in the US,
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.500]   probably all over the world, where you could say,
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.820]   okay, we need a high chair, or we need a pack-and-play,
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.020]   or we need these different things.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.280]   You can kind of rent them from local families
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.060]   and not have to travel with them.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.140]   - I've also done the thing.
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:41.140]   I've done the FedExing ahead of time stuff
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:43.700]   that I'm gonna need there and shipping it back.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.420]   Sometimes, especially now with baggage fees,
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.940]   it ends up being the same as it would be
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.700]   to check in a bag or even less.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.260]   So, for little things like that,
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.380]   that would've been another option.
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.460]   It would've been, maybe not to the Faroe Islands,
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.340]   'cause it's a little remote,
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.020]   and who knows how long it would've taken to get there.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.700]   But if I'm going to the Dolomites or something,
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.980]   maybe you just, and you wanna go carry on,
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.540]   just ship the stuff ahead of time to your hotel.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.500]   They'll accept it, and you pick it up when you're there.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.340]   - There's also something,
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.940]   I'm gonna probably butcher the pronunciation.
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:13.380]   It's like takubin or something like that in Japan,
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.940]   which you basically, there's an entire network of services
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:23.460]   where you can send your bags between hotels.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:27.300]   And it's the most efficient process as most are in Japan.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.060]   And so, I know a lot of people that are traveling,
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.340]   it's like, well, I wanna take the train,
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.840]   but I have this big bag, do I wanna lug it around?
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.620]   So, you just kind of pack an overnight bag.
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.900]   Sometimes, the bag gets there same day,
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:39.840]   and you know in advance,
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.820]   but sometimes, it's the same day or next day.
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.380]   It's like you just pack a day pack, you hop on the train,
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.900]   you head down maybe from Tokyo to Kyoto,
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.740]   you go trek around for the day,
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.180]   you go spend the night, you wake up the next morning,
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.260]   you brought just enough for the next morning,
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.760]   and your toiletries,
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.220]   and then your bag shows up at your hotel.
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.640]   And you had this wonderful experience
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.500]   of both taking the train,
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.320]   not having to go straight to your hotel when you land.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.220]   So, I don't know if that service exists
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.700]   almost anywhere else,
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.660]   but I know that in Japan,
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.820]   it's like a very structured service that's very easy.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.220]   - Yeah, I know some people who swear by it.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.060]   I've never used it, but it makes a lot of sense.
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.620]   - I think it's Takuhaiben, I can't remember.
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:24.000]   I'm terrible at pronouncing basically any Japanese term.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.080]   So, before you talked about the serendipity,
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.500]   and so, okay, we've planned the trip,
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.740]   we've gotten the accommodations,
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.500]   we've gotten there, we've packed all this stuff.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.540]   You've talked about some of what you do
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.180]   when you first get there,
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.060]   but you talked about the serendipity of meeting people,
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:41.300]   locals, kind of immersing yourself in these experiences
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.220]   that you probably couldn't have pretended.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.700]   Do you think there's a way,
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.740]   not necessarily to like cheat the system,
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.220]   but to kind of engineer that serendipity
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.260]   to kind of give it a greater chance of happening
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.580]   than you would if you maybe had a whole week
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.460]   with no agenda?
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.580]   You know, maybe you just go sit at bars, talk to strangers,
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.540]   but what if you have a day
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.460]   and you really want to try to make something local
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.540]   and interesting and magical happen?
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.620]   What would be your advice to someone trying to do that?
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.060]   - I mean, the first one I think is obvious
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.160]   to anyone who's traveled before,
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.980]   but it's put the phone away again.
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.180]   Like, you know, I think,
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.620]   especially when you're traveling alone, I do it too.
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.300]   It's the best social crutch there is, right?
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.180]   If you're sitting alone and you feel nervous about it
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.500]   or you're bored or whatever else,
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.660]   you immediately pull out your phone,
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.620]   but that signals to everyone else that you're busy
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.540]   or you're closed off.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.260]   The amount of conversations that I've started
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.540]   from just sitting somewhere and like just looking around
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.020]   like people used to do when there was,
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.060]   when they had downtime,
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.540]   just kind of staring into space
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.860]   and making eye contact with someone, saying hello,
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.500]   you know, next thing you know, they say hello.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.340]   How are you?
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.180]   Next thing you know,
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.980]   you're getting invited to grandma's house for dinner.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.660]   Like that has happened so many times.
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.660]   I think people are naturally curious,
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.940]   especially for solo travelers.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:59.520]   Like they're curious why you're visiting their home,
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.140]   what you're up to while you're there,
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.980]   if you actually have the best recommendations
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.840]   or if you're going on some, you know,
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.800]   that's something that they consider the tourist path
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.720]   or whatever that you actually,
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.820]   they want to steer you somewhere else.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.900]   People are very passionate about where they're from.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.160]   So tapping into that.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.740]   I think going in also being like,
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.060]   I'm going to be just a little more extroverted
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.020]   than I normally am, goes a long way.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.880]   And I'm not, I'm an extrovert in the sense that I do
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.040]   get energy from being around friends and family
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.520]   and being around people I love.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.400]   But I'm still like a nervous extrovert,
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.240]   if that makes sense.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.720]   Like I still get like phone anxiety
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.820]   and like, you know, weird, weird nervousness
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.740]   around approaching strangers and all these other things.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.840]   So it takes an effort for me to be like,
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.120]   I'm going to strike up a conversation with this,
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.380]   with these random people.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:53.160]   And just as one example, I remember I was in Munich,
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.740]   which is a city that if you ask people from Munich,
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.140]   they'll be the first to admit that it's like
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.200]   not an easy place to meet people.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.740]   It's just part of the, I think,
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.640]   Bavarian culture and such is, it's a little more insular.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.620]   It's a little more, yeah, a little more insular,
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.560]   a little more insider-y.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.640]   So I was having trouble, like I was there for work too,
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.200]   and I needed a story and I was having trouble
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.360]   meeting people.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.460]   And I was hanging out at this bar, not looking at my phone.
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.480]   So I was more aware of my surroundings.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.000]   And I was like overhearing this conversation
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.320]   with a bunch of dudes standing next to me.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.700]   And they were like talking about space and rockets
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.900]   and astrophysics and like all just like
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.320]   very fascinating stuff.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.580]   And like, it took me a second to like work up the courage.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.680]   But once I did, I literally just like poked my head in.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.340]   I was like, "Hey, do you mind if I join you?"
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.940]   And they were like, "Yeah, of course, come on in, whatever."
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:40.960]   And I brought them around or whatever.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.200]   Next thing I know, I'm talking to these like
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.480]   five astrophysicists who were working on some like
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.680]   German space program in the woods of Munich,
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.600]   just like totally fascinating stuff.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.320]   We spend the whole rest of the evening together.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.840]   We go to a show, we just like hang out,
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.920]   taking me to like all their favorite beer gardens.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.840]   And all because I just took that plunge.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.820]   And it was like a little weird.
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.640]   It's a little awkward to do that in any situation,
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:02.800]   at least for me it is.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.520]   But like, I took a deep breath and went in there
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.360]   and said, "Hello."
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.580]   And next thing you know, I had this really wonderful,
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.380]   pretty magical day in a city where it's hard to do that.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.140]   It's hard to find that serendipity.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.980]   So I think those would be my two biggest
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.180]   overarching tips around that is one,
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.280]   being open to it, opening yourself up to it.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.580]   And the first step towards that
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:28.860]   is literally being physically available.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.180]   So stop staring at your phone,
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.620]   put the book down for a second, just be there.
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.640]   Look around and see what happens.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.000]   And then two, it's like, push yourself
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.580]   to just be a little more extroverted than you usually are.
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.220]   And then actually, I'd add a third one too.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.160]   And this goes back to mindset as well.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.620]   And this has taken me a while to really master,
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.180]   if I can even call it that.
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:56.180]   But it's admitting your own ignorance and embracing it.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.440]   I think a lot of the times,
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.340]   especially with well-traveled people,
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.900]   there's a tendency to be like,
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.540]   to make it competitive almost, right?
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.140]   Be like, oh, I know this, and I've been there,
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.240]   and I know my way around this,
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.100]   and I've traveled, so I don't need help,
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:10.940]   and I can find my way,
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.060]   and I've read about this place that I'm traveling to,
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.220]   so I don't need to know anymore.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:19.580]   But people, you're never gonna know
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.860]   as much as someone who lives there,
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.080]   who has been born and raised there.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.120]   You're never gonna know as much.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.280]   You could live there for 10, 20 years.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.700]   You're still not gonna know as much as someone.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.700]   I've lived in New York for a decade.
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:29.580]   I'm not a New Yorker.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.780]   I'm never gonna know New York like a New Yorker.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.220]   And admitting that leads to you asking the right questions.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.180]   It leads to the approach that you have
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:38.080]   when you're talking to people,
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.580]   the openness that you bring to new experiences
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.380]   and new culturals and things that might be unfamiliar to you.
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.980]   All of that first is gonna just come across
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.660]   so much more effectively if you first admit
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.440]   that you really don't know anything,
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.340]   and you're there to learn, and you're there to engage.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.900]   And I think just that mindset opens up a place
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.740]   in a big way, and it's very hard to do,
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.140]   especially the more traveled you are,
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.080]   'cause you start being like, oh, I know my way around.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.820]   I know how to navigate this stuff.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.780]   And so still for me, too, when I'm at a place
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.760]   that I've been to 100 times,
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.060]   I still try to approach it as like,
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:11.980]   there's still something to learn.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.060]   I still am not a local.
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.780]   I'll never be, so what can I learn from a local?
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.500]   And having that eagerness and that curiosity
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.380]   is gonna make you approach the right people
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.340]   and ask the right questions,
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.980]   and then the rest is serendipity.
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.680]   - So I love that approach.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.060]   I've used it a lot.
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:31.020]   And you traveled a lot as a solo traveler.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:31.860]   You just got married.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.020]   Congratulations.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.540]   I've heard you on a couple podcasts say,
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.980]   one day, maybe there's a family.
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.140]   I have one.
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.500]   How do you think that changes?
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.400]   Or you haven't been through it yet,
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.700]   but you've probably met lots of travelers.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.220]   The idea of spending the afternoon
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.060]   kind of sitting in a bar, meeting some astrophysicists,
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.100]   going out to a random show
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.140]   is not the kind of experience it's easy to have
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.380]   with young kids around.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:58.300]   So how do you kind of create these interesting experiences
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.520]   when you probably have a tighter schedule?
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.260]   And have you thought at all about that
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.540]   or talked to anyone that's done it successfully?
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.180]   - I'd be curious, actually, from you, actually,
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:11.180]   if you've felt, as your travel style has changed,
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.080]   how you've felt yourself adapting.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:17.180]   I think what's exciting about traveling with kids
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.160]   and having kids is that you now get to instill
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:23.620]   that curiosity and that sense of serendipity
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:24.940]   in someone new, right?
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.500]   And encourage that in someone
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.740]   and have them grow into the kind of traveler
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.660]   that maybe it took you longer to be.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:34.860]   And I know that that's much easier said than done
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.040]   when there's like nap time and meal time
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.780]   and all these things that are pretty set in stone
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.260]   when you're traveling.
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.580]   But I do wonder if there's not like,
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:47.100]   of course, yeah, you can't be like, peace out, partner.
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.060]   I'm gonna go hang out at the bar
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.660]   and meet some astrophysicists, have fun with the kids.
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.460]   But I do wonder if there are like micro moments
[00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:54.980]   of serendipity that you can create
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:56.160]   where you can be like,
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.620]   we're gonna go for, we've rented this car,
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.260]   we're gonna go for a drive on this route
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:03.080]   that we've researched,
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.120]   but we don't know where we're gonna stop yet.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.620]   We don't know where we're gonna have lunch.
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.140]   We don't know where we're gonna go for a little hike.
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.500]   These little things that you just leave open enough
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.460]   so that when you do do it, you're discovering it together.
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.140]   You're discovering that moment together.
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:17.620]   You're having that moment of uncertainty
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.540]   and be like, oh, is this the right place for the hike?
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.660]   Ooh, this looks a little intense,
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:21.860]   but then you do it together and you're like,
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.020]   wow, we did that, that was crazy.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.300]   I remember when we did that thing.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.220]   And I think I learned that from my parents too.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.900]   And my parents were very good about doing that.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.980]   I don't, I have like this problem where I like,
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.960]   I don't remember a lot of things concretely
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.320]   from my childhood, but I have like vague,
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.940]   like more like snapshots.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:45.140]   And I have so many like mental snapshots of family trips,
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:48.820]   of, you know, like the car pulled over
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.820]   on the side of the road,
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.620]   the physical map out over the hood of the car
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.340]   while my parents are like tracing our route
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:55.660]   and trying to figure out where the hell we are
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.740]   and where the hell we're going.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.620]   I have so many memories of us, you know,
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.660]   before smartphones, before the internet,
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.100]   pulling into hotels and like knocking on the door,
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.340]   you know, and being like, hey, do you have space for five
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.580]   at like 10 o'clock at night?
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.180]   Like my parents did that stuff a lot.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.420]   And I think that, you know, they still, of course,
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.580]   their safety was the first priority.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.220]   When we were younger, there was all these other needs
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.540]   they had to cater to,
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.780]   but they still kept that little bit of mystery to travel.
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.060]   And that little bit of we're kind of gonna make it up
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:25.900]   as we go along.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.780]   We're gonna improvise a little bit
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.100]   and we're gonna do it together.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.540]   And we're gonna have a conversation about like,
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.020]   ooh, which of these two restaurants looks better?
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.860]   What do you think, little Jimmy?
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.780]   You know, like bring them into it,
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.380]   bring them into that experience.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.980]   So I think there's ways.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.620]   I think, yeah, maybe you can't do it like you used to
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.980]   fully kind of flying by the seat of your pants.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.740]   But I think in micro moments and through little adjustments
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.940]   and through involving them in your decision-making process
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:53.660]   as you go, you can still keep that mystery of travel alive.
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:54.500]   - Yeah, it's funny.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:55.980]   As you were talking, I just started thinking
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.740]   about a trip we haven't planned yet,
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.660]   but different ways that we would kind of bring it to life
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.500]   with children.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.900]   And our kids are two in two months.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.060]   So, you know, we're not quite old enough
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.740]   to take them on all the adventures,
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.180]   but a few things came to mind.
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.820]   One, in the last few, I don't know, months, year,
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.540]   we've met a number of interesting people
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.740]   that live in our neighborhood going to the park.
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:19.540]   Like just the park down the street from our house,
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:20.980]   we meet parents almost every time.
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.340]   So for some reason,
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.300]   I hadn't thought about it until you were talking,
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:26.300]   but I feel like we could just,
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.540]   if you want to meet random stranger,
[00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.020]   instead of doing it at the bar
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.140]   where you're sitting having a drink,
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:33.100]   which might be, you know, the solo traveler,
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.620]   you know, place of choice,
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.820]   you could also just go to a park.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.100]   You'll probably meet other parents.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.460]   They probably have other kids your same age.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.820]   You could make that your place
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:44.220]   to serendipitously strike up a conversation.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.940]   So that was one that came to mind.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:48.820]   Another thing that I think every person I know
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:50.900]   that seems to have unlocked travel
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.900]   one level beyond with children does
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:57.700]   is they all contact their hotel in advance
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:58.860]   or wherever they're staying
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.700]   and try to find some trusted source of childcare
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.860]   that can, not for the entire trip,
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.140]   but maybe help out one night
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.420]   so the parents can go out
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.100]   and have that kind of interesting, unique adventure
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.300]   of just walking down the street,
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.380]   finding a place to eat, et cetera.
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:15.260]   - Another way to do that,
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.860]   and I know I have some friends with kids
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.700]   who have taken this route as well,
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.860]   is traveling with another family
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:23.900]   or another two families that are friends of yours
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.300]   with kids the same age.
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.060]   Then like you either can kind of rotate
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.660]   who's in charge of the kids that night
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.500]   while the others go out to a show or dinner
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.460]   or to meet people or whatever else,
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.300]   or you all kind of pull your money together
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.900]   while you're hanging out in France for some childcare
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:40.460]   that can take care of the kids one of the nights
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:41.940]   or two of the nights or whatever.
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.620]   And that way you're doing it together
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.100]   and it's a little easier.
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.700]   So I know some people who have gone that route too,
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.620]   and I think that's a great way to tackle it as well.
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.580]   - The last one that I'm really excited about,
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.460]   and Japan hasn't opened the borders yet,
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.820]   but I'm a big fan.
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:56.860]   We've been a few times.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.100]   It's like re-experiencing the places
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.220]   that you know a little bit, right?
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.940]   Like I've never lived in Japan.
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:03.340]   I've been three or four times.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.100]   I wouldn't consider myself an expert,
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.460]   but I do feel like I know it well enough
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:10.300]   to make it easier to kind of wander the streets
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.700]   and have a serendipitous experience
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.780]   than I would if I'd gone to Uzbekistan,
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:15.060]   which I've never been to,
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.660]   and I feel like I would be trying to get my bearings
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.380]   as well as lead the family
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.740]   through the public transportation.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:22.700]   So one thing I'm excited about
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:24.840]   is just going to places I've been
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.780]   to kind of share that experience
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.240]   and make it a little easier, right?
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:31.900]   Like the first trip with two kids running around a city,
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.740]   probably nice if you go to a place you know.
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.180]   Maybe you even test it out locally.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.940]   Maybe we go to New York for a long weekend
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:39.540]   'cause it's like, I know that city even better.
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:41.500]   You know, we've already tested it in San Francisco.
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.580]   You know, we take the Caltrain.
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.260]   We actually throw our bikes on the Caltrain,
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:47.300]   ride the Caltrain up to San Francisco,
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.100]   bike around, and then come back.
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.540]   So like we're trying to get a feeling
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.900]   for what it's like to adventure in a city.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.360]   You know, we have our own travel training wheels
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.060]   as new parents that we're kind of trying to take off
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.580]   before we take a big adventure.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:01.860]   - But also like what a fun thing
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:04.400]   to like see a place that you thought you knew well,
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.420]   like to see it anew
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.100]   through the eyes of someone else too, right?
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.420]   Like I think that's why people love taking friends
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.660]   to places that they love or whatever.
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.740]   I'm in the middle of planning a bachelor party
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:15.800]   for friends of mine.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.420]   And I'm really excited that they've chosen New Orleans,
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.060]   which is like a city that like I love so much.
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.500]   And now I'm gonna be able to like see it anew
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.260]   through their eyes, seeing it for the first time
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:27.600]   and go to all the restaurants that I love
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.900]   and all the bars that I love and do all these things.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.340]   And I think that's just like such a fun thing to do.
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.700]   I can imagine with kids too,
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.980]   to like see them get excited about something
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:37.920]   that maybe you've taken for granted
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.680]   by the fourth or fifth visit.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.620]   - The other last one,
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:43.980]   and I'm fascinated by this broader topic,
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:47.180]   is just when you have a limited time
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.860]   and budget isn't the primary concern,
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.700]   it's trying to, you know, you can hire experiences, right?
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.240]   You could do Airbnb experiences.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.860]   You can find locals in various, you know,
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.260]   even if you're staying at a hotel,
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.740]   ask for a cooking class or these kinds of things.
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.280]   The hidden mystery of like fixers in other countries
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.700]   that help kind of engineer experiences and crazy things,
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.620]   I've always been fascinated by finding
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:12.340]   the most authentic ones versus the most commercial ones.
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.340]   So I'd love your thoughts there,
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:14.780]   but that's the other thing.
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:16.540]   It's like, if you only have a couple of days
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:18.100]   and you've got a tight schedule
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.580]   and you wanna go have some authentic experience
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:23.060]   cooking with a local, you know,
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:24.720]   sometimes you don't have time
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.420]   to just go find the random local
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:28.220]   until someone invites you to cook in their home
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.240]   and you might just have to hire it.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.440]   What are your thoughts on those?
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.980]   Are there better ways to do it?
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:35.040]   How do you find those interesting people?
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.280]   - I've done that route many times
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.220]   and I try to look as local as possible.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.460]   So it takes some Googling, it takes some digging.
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.600]   So you're not necessarily going through a Viator
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.860]   or Airbnb experiences or whatever,
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:49.460]   which some of them are, you know, very local.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:50.360]   Some of them are very small.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.700]   But if you just like start Googling,
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.680]   like walking tours of this city,
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.600]   you might find someone who has little, you know,
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.700]   their own kind of ramshackle operation that they do.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.900]   And that's like the most intimate experience
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:01.900]   you're gonna get, I think.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.020]   So I think doing some digging
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:06.460]   until you find something independent on its own.
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.240]   I used to like really be, I don't know,
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.320]   so like some chip on my shoulder
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.320]   about being exactly what I was talking about,
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.740]   about being an experienced traveler.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.640]   I don't need this stuff or whatever.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.360]   I used to be like pretty against the idea
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:22.040]   of the walking tour or even like the group tour in general.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.320]   I used to be like, I don't need that.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.820]   I can find my own way.
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:27.800]   But then I started doing these, like a lot of cities,
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.000]   especially in Europe, have these like free walking tours
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.540]   that like leave three times a day
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.840]   from the center of town or whatever.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.640]   And I started doing those when I was traveling in Europe
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.600]   and kind of fell in love with them.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.400]   It was like such a great way to like
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.200]   just get an overview of a place
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.400]   and gets a little bit of background
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.160]   before you start your own explorations.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.920]   But also I found that a lot of the tour guides
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.480]   are not only awesome, but if you talk to them,
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:56.560]   they're like down to hang out beyond just the tour.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.860]   They're doing the job, you know, for the money, of course,
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:51:59.720]   but paid by the city,
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.360]   but also because they love meeting people
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.760]   and they love showing people where they're from.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.280]   I think of two examples, one in Cadiz in Spain
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:12.200]   and one in a city in Germany where I like,
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.480]   I could tell that like just the vibe of the tour guides
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.600]   was like really good.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.760]   And so afterwards I was like,
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.400]   what are you up to this evening?
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.760]   Like, what are you doing?
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.040]   And they're like, oh, like nothing.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:21.960]   I was like, can I take you to dinner?
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.080]   Like your favorite restaurant?
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.880]   Like what, you down to hang out?
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.880]   And next thing you know, I'm having this amazing experience
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:29.120]   because I've just taken that plunge of being like,
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:33.680]   okay, you gave me the city sanctioned tour.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.080]   Now can we like, can I buy you a drink
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.720]   and you can give me the other side of things?
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:40.080]   So I think doing that is a great jumping off point
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:40.920]   to meeting people.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:42.760]   I think you'll find that the same people
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.320]   who are working in tourism,
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:48.280]   who are offering tours are very interested
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:50.800]   that you're there and are very enthusiastic
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.080]   about showing you around.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.720]   So I think that that's a great place to start.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.420]   In terms of like actual companies,
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.720]   I think the more local, the better.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.760]   If you can find someone who doesn't work
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.560]   for a major chain or whatever else,
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.440]   who's just doing it on their own.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:13.120]   In my experience, they give the best tours.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.520]   - You've traveled to so many places.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.240]   One of the reasons I originally wanted to connect with you
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.040]   was that the New York Times 52 places
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:23.480]   was kind of like my annual travel inspiration.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.760]   You know, I think at least half a dozen places
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.880]   I've been in my life were because, you know,
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.580]   that post got me inspired.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.320]   The fact that you got to go on all but one
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.800]   of the 52 in a year,
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.260]   while that might've been a grueling adventure,
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.400]   it was certainly something that is gonna go down
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:43.100]   as probably one of the more memorable travel experiences
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.740]   of your entire life, I assume.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:50.320]   What are some of the experiences you had on that year
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.960]   that you think are fascinating and worth sharing
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.200]   for people to hear about?
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:01.440]   - Yeah, so, you know, I did a lot of really incredible things
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.960]   like surface level, incredible things, right?
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.300]   I saw a solar, total solar eclipse
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:11.340]   from a astronomical observatory in the deserts of Chile.
[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:13.680]   You know, I saw, I was the only,
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.380]   I was like me and three other people
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:18.260]   and the colony of hundreds of king penguins
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.360]   in the Falkland Islands.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.140]   I, you know, did all these things,
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:22.580]   saw all these incredible things.
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.060]   But when I, this is gonna,
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.740]   I know it's gonna sound cheesy and there's gonna,
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.500]   I can hear the eye rolls from here,
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.460]   but like when I, it's true that when I think back
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:34.740]   of the year, the first, when I think back to that year,
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.760]   the first images that come to my mind
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:39.460]   are not all the beautiful things I saw
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:41.660]   and all the amazing things I ate.
[00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.060]   It's people's faces, it's people I met.
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.900]   It's 100% my biggest takeaway from that
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:50.480]   were the interactions I had with human beings.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.980]   I think of like the woman in Denmark
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:57.260]   who like literally called into sick to work for a week
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.900]   just so she could show me around Alborg.
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.020]   And, you know, I had dinner with her family
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:03.120]   and she showed me all her favorite places.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:06.260]   It's the guy in Samarkand, Uzbekistan,
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:08.940]   who drove me out to see a game of kopkari,
[00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:10.740]   which is this incredible sport
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:13.080]   where you have all these guys on horses
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.500]   playing a game of keep away with a dead goat
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.020]   that's been stuffed with rice.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:20.580]   And like, I was the only tourist there,
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:23.140]   literally thousands and thousands of local spectators
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:27.180]   and just me alone there, incredible.
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:30.240]   Again, just from an interaction turning into an experience.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:34.140]   It's the family that hosted me in Orcas Island,
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.820]   this family who has a farm.
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:41.820]   And on my birthday, I was there alone on my birthday.
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.280]   And so they said, "We got to celebrate."
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:45.340]   And so they killed a duck in my honor
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.160]   and we ate and we prepared and ate an entire duck
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.820]   and had this huge feast with this family,
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.260]   three generations of this family
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:54.380]   who has been on this island in Washington state for years
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:55.620]   and run this farm there.
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:58.420]   It's like these experiences that really stuck with me
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:01.720]   and changed the way I think about travel in the future too.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.500]   It's where like, those are the,
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.640]   I am looking for those human interactions now
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.360]   when I'm on the road, no matter how small,
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.660]   even in places where I'm going for the nature.
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:12.940]   You know, I just got back from the Faroe Islands,
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:16.240]   which is this incredible, beautiful,
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.180]   just naturally stunning part of the world,
[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.660]   just incredibly high, dramatic cliffs.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:24.580]   So green, you know, just empty, empty stretches of land
[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.260]   where you don't see any sign of human habitation.
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.820]   And I went on these beautiful hikes and saw puffins
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:31.300]   and all these other seabirds and it's just like,
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.120]   really incredible.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.140]   But one of my favorite experiences was like,
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:37.780]   talking to these random group of like 20 somethings
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.500]   who had rented out a small house there for the weekend.
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.220]   They'd come from one island to another island.
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:44.780]   And next thing you know, they were like,
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:49.220]   offering me fermented lamb and whale jerky
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.100]   and like two different bottles of gin
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.980]   to try the different gin from the Faroe Islands.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.800]   Just like having this really great serendipitous encounter
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.900]   that lasted like 30 minutes,
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.460]   'cause I had to get on a ferry.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:03.960]   And that was, that's what stuck with me.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:08.880]   So, I don't know, it's just, that's for me,
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.840]   all my favorite experiences with travel,
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.360]   including with the 52 places trip,
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.600]   have involved other people.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.880]   And I kind of use that to inform what I do
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:22.180]   and how I approach and how I think about the why of travel.
[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:25.520]   It's really influenced the way I think
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.420]   about those things now, going forward.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:32.080]   - Well, that might make you dislike this game, I guess,
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.880]   that I'm gonna play with you now.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.200]   So, I'm just gonna, we're just gonna get through it.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.640]   But I get a lot of emails from listeners saying,
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.200]   "Hey, what are your favorite places to go?
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.580]   "Where should I go?
[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:43.420]   "I've been to 60 some-odd countries,
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.200]   "not the 80 some-odd you've been."
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:51.280]   And so, I thought, I'd love to run through continents.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.480]   You've lived on four of them.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.660]   So, you've got, I know you've hit four,
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:56.240]   but I also know I think you've hit all of them,
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.040]   and even Antarctica, which I have not.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:02.200]   And I would just love, we don't need to go too deep,
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.980]   but just to give people some inspiration.
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.800]   I think earlier, in the very beginning,
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.480]   we talked about how might you get some inspiration
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.640]   for places.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.920]   Maybe we just throw some inspiration out,
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.560]   give a line or two about why.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.160]   Some could be places that are obvious, right?
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.200]   Like, I can already tell you I'm gonna include Japan,
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.200]   and there's no secret that Japan
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.800]   is like a travel destination, right?
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.280]   But, are you up for it?
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.280]   - Yeah, let's do it.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:28.360]   - Okay, so I say we start at home.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:32.780]   I'm gonna make you go first, and start in North America.
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:37.180]   - Okay, I'll go first with North America.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.720]   I gotta do it, and listen,
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.400]   I know people are gonna be like, yeah, duh,
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.820]   but I'm gonna say New Orleans,
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:47.080]   but I'm gonna say not the New Orleans you think of
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.040]   when you think of visiting New Orleans.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.480]   I think you need to go to New Orleans,
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.440]   and never step foot onto Bourbon Street,
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.520]   barely even enter the French Quarter,
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.560]   and experience New Orleans like someone
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:58.520]   who lives in New Orleans.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:01.720]   And that means, you know, yeah, sure, go for Mardi Gras,
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.280]   but go for the actual parades, and the parties,
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.520]   and the stuff that happens in people's backyards.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.680]   Go for all the other festivals that happen
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:12.400]   after Mardi Gras, and the other fairs.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.280]   I think it is a magical, magical city
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.080]   that's unlike anywhere else,
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.840]   not just in North America, but the world.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:20.320]   - I think, geographically,
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.160]   Central America is in North America,
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.120]   if we're talking continents, is that correct?
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:24.960]   - Yeah, sure. - Okay, cool.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.600]   So, my whole family took a trip to El Salvador,
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:31.280]   and we stayed at this small,
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.800]   I wish I could, I'll try to put the name
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.240]   of the place on the show notes.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:38.000]   We found this small family-run eight-room hotel
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   on the beach that was just like, wake up.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.680]   It was almost like a bed and breakfast,
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.200]   but it was kind of operated a little bit more like a resort,
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.960]   but definitely run by a family.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.280]   Surfing was interesting.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.960]   We'd walk down the beach to the little city,
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.960]   or a little town right near there.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.800]   It was awesome.
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.880]   And then after, I can't even remember
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.320]   how we ended up getting to Nicaragua,
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.800]   and just kind of staying in the rainforest,
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.200]   and kind of exploring,
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.240]   and everyone always says go to Costa Rica.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.680]   That seems to be the primary destination,
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.800]   but I would recommend either of those countries.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.400]   We had a great experience just kind of exploring
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.800]   around where we were staying,
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.320]   and kind of a local,
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.600]   I don't even know what to call this place,
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.520]   'cause you could call it a resort,
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.400]   but you could also call it a plot of land
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.040]   someone built a few houses on, and the family operates.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:31.960]   - Love that.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.240]   Anything else outside of the U.S. in that area?
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.600]   I know we've got a lot to get through,
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.160]   but you've also seen a lot.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.480]   - Yeah, on the Pacific coast,
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.440]   this was one of the 52 places, actually.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.080]   I mean, actually, no, not specifically,
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.480]   'cause Panama was on the 52 places list,
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.200]   but there's a little town called Santa Catalina
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.920]   on the Pacific coast of Panama, on the west coast.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.240]   It's about a six-hour drive, maybe, from Panama City,
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.120]   and it's just this, like,
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:05.120]   when you think of the bohemian surfer paradise,
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.760]   like, this is it, hidden away,
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.040]   tons of locals living there, too,
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.400]   so it's not the kind of place that's been colonized
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.960]   by foreign surfers,
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.680]   but just a place where time slows down,
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.320]   and I spent just hours just sitting on this huge beach,
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.160]   also happens to be right off of Coiba,
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.200]   which is a national park
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.880]   with some of the best scuba diving in the world,
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.640]   so after days and days of just hanging on this beach,
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.360]   eating fresh fish every day,
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.720]   I went for a dive in Coiba,
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:42.720]   and at the end of our second dive,
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.720]   I look up, and there's just a giant whale shark
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.920]   just circling us, right above us,
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.560]   one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had,
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.440]   and it was all in this place that just felt like
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.520]   a place that had been hidden
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.000]   from the rest of the world for forever,
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.440]   and I hope it's still like that after I wrote about it,
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.160]   but I think it is,
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.080]   'cause it felt like I'd entered a portal
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.240]   into another dimension, honestly.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.760]   - Gosh, I don't even wanna remember how many years ago.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.880]   In college, so, like, a long time ago for me,
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.000]   I went to Tamarindo in Costa Rica,
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.120]   and it felt like that,
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.480]   and I have since learned, I don't wanna go back.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.400]   As much as it was one of the fondest memories of travel,
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.480]   I have, but I don't wanna go back,
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.080]   because I've heard it is not like that anymore, so.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.160]   - I've heard it's not like that either, yeah.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.680]   - Okay, so South America,
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:36.400]   I'll kick off, 'cause I don't have a lot.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.840]   South America is one of the places I haven't traveled a lot,
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.600]   but I enjoyed Cartagena.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.320]   I thought it was, like, an incredibly fascinating city.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.240]   Full disclosure, I went on my bachelor party.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:51.600]   However, it was a city that, you know,
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.680]   I've been to a lot of places
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.760]   where you just feel like you're in a different place.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.720]   Like, we didn't just do bachelor party things, right?
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.440]   Like, we went and explored the castle.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.320]   We took a boat out to a random island.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.680]   We just hopped around the island.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.720]   It was awesome, and I would recommend it to anyone.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.960]   - Yeah, and so I'm half Colombian, so full disclosure.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.040]   My mother's from Colombia, so I second that recommendation,
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.200]   but I would also encourage people
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.080]   to explore beyond Cartagena, too.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.840]   I mean, Cartagena's great, especially for a first-timer.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.360]   There's a lot of tourism infrastructure there and stuff, too,
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.920]   but check out some of the other cities.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.880]   Medellin, which is where my family's from,
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:31.960]   is not the Medellin of the '80s, you know,
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.600]   that people associate with Escobar and everything else.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.320]   It's an incredibly dynamic, fast-growing,
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:41.240]   super-fun city with incredible nightlife
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:45.320]   and just, like, has the energy of a city on the move.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.440]   You really feel it.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.120]   It's also just physically beautiful.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.760]   There's also parts on the coast of Colombia,
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.880]   like the Pacific coast, that for a long time
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.960]   were largely off-limits because of conflict
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.040]   that are now kind of opening up to tourists
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.080]   for the first time, and there's just so much
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.760]   to see in Colombia, so I second that recommendation.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.800]   To have something different, though,
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.200]   I'm gonna go actually a little bit
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.800]   into the Caribbean for this one.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.600]   I think there's a lot on mainland South America
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.520]   that I could recommend.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.960]   Ecuador's incredible.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.040]   City of Quito is worth spending a lot of time in if you can,
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.400]   but I'm gonna go actually right off the coast
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.760]   to the island of Bonaire,
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.320]   which is one of the Dutch Antilles,
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.480]   so if you know, like, CuraÃ§ao, Aruba,
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.120]   and then Bonaire's there as well,
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.040]   and Bonaire is another place that I feel like
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.360]   has slipped under the radar
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:36.800]   for a lot of people for a long time,
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.720]   and I think no matter how much I talk about it,
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.920]   at least I'm not gonna ruin it
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:43.440]   because it's just, there's something special about it.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.440]   Just another place where you can really slow down.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.840]   Beautiful beaches.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.560]   Some of the best scuba diving in the world,
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.920]   if that's what you're into.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:54.600]   And just also a very fascinating cultural milieu
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.880]   of African influence, Dutch influence,
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.640]   mainland South American influence.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:03.960]   Really cool place to just rent a house on the beach
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.040]   and hang out for a week
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.440]   and pick up fish from the market every morning,
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.240]   cook it in the evening.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.120]   Good place to unplug for that.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:12.520]   - It might be right next to Aruba,
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.200]   but I had the exact opposite experience in Aruba.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.800]   I felt like it's just become
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.800]   the most commercialized, Americanized island.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.000]   - So it could not be more different.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.880]   It's literally like two sides of a coin.
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.400]   It's really interesting.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.720]   And I think the difference is that Bonaire,
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.440]   while having nice beaches,
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:31.000]   it doesn't have those huge sandy beaches
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.600]   that make for a great setting for huge resorts.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.960]   Here it's more rocky beaches.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.920]   It's a little more rugged.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.880]   And because of that, it hasn't had the,
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.000]   and hopefully it never does,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.320]   the kind of infrastructure boom that Aruba has had.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.640]   Okay, you want me to go first for Europe?
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.880]   - Yeah.
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.640]   - I'm gonna say the town of Plovdiv, Bulgaria.
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.720]   It's the second biggest city in Bulgaria.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.960]   One of the coolest towns I've ever been to,
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.520]   just full of creative energy, young people.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.120]   There's an area called,
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.120]   I think it's called Kapana or something in Bulgarian,
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.480]   but it means the trap,
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:06.560]   because once you get into it,
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.080]   it's very hard to find your way around.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:12.360]   It's like this very densely packed
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.040]   kind of cluster of buildings,
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:18.120]   but it's like full of bars and cafes and full bookstores
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.920]   and just like this, a lot of creative people,
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.200]   a lot of creative energy.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.080]   It's also, they call it the other city of seven hills.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.720]   So if Rome has seven hills, so does Plovdiv.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.720]   But these hills are like smack in the middle of town.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.920]   So you can go on a hike through the woods
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.120]   in the middle of the city,
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.040]   come out the other side
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.960]   and be in the second biggest city in Bulgaria.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.480]   Such a cool place.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.840]   And I can't wait to go back.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.920]   It was one of the places on my 52 places trip, actually,
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.280]   that I was like walking around
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.880]   and I was constantly thinking like,
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.280]   I could rent a place here for like six months or a year,
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.600]   just hang out, just read
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.240]   and go to the local coffee shop in the morning
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.960]   and write in the evening and had that kind of vibe.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.280]   Plovdiv.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.000]   - I felt that way about Budapest, like being there.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.400]   I was like, we could just move here and it would be amazing,
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.160]   but I'm not gonna go there.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:09.840]   I'm gonna go to Bosnia and there are two things.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.960]   So we were in Croatia and we thought,
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.360]   why don't we just rent a car and drive across the border
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.280]   and just see what happens.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.400]   And we drove up to Mostar,
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.720]   which is this like wild city
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.720]   that just kind of feels like a amalgamation
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.120]   of like every culture in the world, almost.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.240]   The food was amazing.
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.080]   There's the most fascinating people watching
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.200]   because there's this bridge that is famous
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.160]   for jumping off of,
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.240]   and you can kind of just relax and sit by the water
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:38.000]   and you watch these people trying to get people
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.400]   to join the Mostar Bridge Jumping Club,
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:44.840]   which I was like, just close to doing it, didn't do it.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.960]   If I go back, I'm like, I'm doing it, I'm doing it.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.240]   This is my plan.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.960]   But the one thing I will suggest people do.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:56.960]   So there is this famous general from the Soviet Union, Tito.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.840]   He built this bunker and I think it's probably the largest.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.720]   I mean, I could be wrong,
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.840]   but it might be one of the,
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.160]   if not the largest bunker in the world.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.960]   It's gigantic.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.800]   And it's set inside just a random
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.920]   like neighborhood-y kind of experience.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.440]   You go into this neighborhood,
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.000]   you go into this house and in the garage,
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   there's just this false fake door.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.600]   You go in the door and all of a sudden
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.360]   you're inside this gigantic bunker
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.360]   that they've kind of turned into an art gallery.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.960]   I don't even know how to explain the experience.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.880]   We had heard about it
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.240]   and we just basically asked every local we could
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.120]   to figure out how it worked
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.200]   and someone knew someone who had a tour.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:39.280]   I think it's slightly a little easier to go on now
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:42.040]   than it was at the time.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.640]   But that is my recommendation is to go explore that.
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:45.760]   In today's dollars,
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.880]   the bunker would have cost over $4 billion to build.
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.120]   It is, it's literally one of the most gigantic things.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.840]   I think hundreds of rooms.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.800]   I wish I had more of the information about it
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.720]   off the top of my head.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:02.040]   But that tour and experience was just so fascinating.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.840]   And the kinds of people were on it.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.680]   We had conversations about why they were there,
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.600]   how they learned about it.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.680]   'Cause it didn't feel like a tourist experience,
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.680]   though I would put it as a tourist experience.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.960]   All right, South Africa.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:20.000]   - I think there's a lot of options here.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.920]   I'm gonna go with the city of Dakar in Senegal.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.120]   Another city that within a few days,
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.160]   I was like, I could live here for sure.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.600]   Music everywhere.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.280]   Just another city where you just feel the energy of it
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.280]   the moment you step off the plane.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.200]   People are so friendly, so hospitable.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.000]   So many little places to have,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.240]   get a whole fish grilled up on the beach.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.400]   I think the whole fish,
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.200]   the whole grilled fish is a common thread
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.720]   between all my choices so far.
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.360]   So you can tell what I,
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:50.800]   it's a great universal of travel
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.400]   is the whole fish just grilled to perfection.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.160]   And in Senegal, you get that too.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:59.480]   Yeah, like music everywhere, amazing history,
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.960]   both tragic and not in terms of the history.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:08.240]   Really cool nightlife with live music everywhere.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:14.120]   I mean, just a really amazing dynamic modern city
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.960]   that I think a lot of people,
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.240]   'cause I think people overlook African cities in general.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.400]   If people are traveling to Africa,
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.720]   they're thinking nature, they're thinking safari,
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.640]   they're thinking all these things, which is true.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:24.480]   It's a reason for it.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.520]   It's spectacular in terms of nature.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.880]   But I think the cities have a lot to offer.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.360]   I mean, this is like one of the youngest populations
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.200]   in the world that are on that continent, right?
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.200]   So there's just an incredible energy
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.080]   and incredible forward momentum,
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.320]   and you really feel it in a city like Dakar.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.160]   - I like it.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.440]   I'm gonna go a little off the rails here,
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.760]   or actually on the rails.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:44.960]   That was not supposed to be a joke,
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.400]   but it just happened and suggest people
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.640]   check out the Tazara train.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.880]   So it's a train from,
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:56.240]   or I guess between Tanzania and Zambia.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.760]   If I want, we took this, my wife and I,
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.040]   almost a decade ago, a little longer,
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.600]   and it was like a three-day train ride.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.560]   And almost every person I've ever heard
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:10.400]   says the train breaks down a little bit every time.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.440]   You usually end up stopping in a random village.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.680]   Everyone can kind of go explore, and you get back on.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.120]   You meet the most fascinating people on the train
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.000]   because people that take a train for three days in Africa
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.240]   have some interesting story to tell.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.760]   Flights in Africa are really expensive,
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.960]   so it's a really affordable way to get around.
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.960]   And if at the end of that experience
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.760]   you want a little bit something different
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.600]   that's maybe a little bit more relaxing,
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.440]   you end up in Dar es Salaam,
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.120]   and you can take a ferry to Zanzibar,
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.880]   which is kind of this otherworldly cool island
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.840]   with a lot of both sad and interesting history as well.
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:45.680]   So that's my-
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:49.480]   - And Zanzibar, I think, has, if not the,
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.160]   some of the best beaches I've ever seen in my life.
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.000]   - Yeah.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.120]   - Around Zanzibar, just unreal.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:54.960]   - It's wild.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.080]   - So that's what I've got.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.840]   Obviously, if you haven't taken a safari somewhere in Africa
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.160]   it's an amazing experience,
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.000]   but I assume that's not something
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.560]   someone needs to be told about.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.840]   This is gonna be the hardest one
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.560]   because it encompasses so many places.
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.880]   What are your kind of one to two hot spots in Asia?
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:12.840]   - Oof, yeah, it is really hard,
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:15.440]   especially 'cause I grew up there for the most part.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.280]   So I'm not gonna, I'm gonna skip over Indonesia
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.920]   because that's like an obvious choice for me
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.640]   'cause that's where I spent my formative years,
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:24.800]   but I'll say plainly, Indonesia.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.920]   It's endless in terms of the places you can go.
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.200]   Literally, there's 20,000 islands or whatever.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.240]   So that's a good place to start looking beyond Bali
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.400]   and other things like that.
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.400]   But I'm gonna say,
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:39.000]   I'm gonna say Vietnam.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.760]   I think the cities especially, I'm thinking,
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:46.640]   going from north to south,
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.920]   Hanoi, Da Nang, and Saigon,
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.200]   I think all offer very different things.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.720]   And I think the cities are just incredible.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.080]   I think it's, you'll eat maybe the best
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.320]   you've ever eaten in your life
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.800]   just off on plastic stools on the side of the road.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.800]   It's just a attention to detail with the food universally
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.720]   that you don't get in a lot of places
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.200]   and for next to nothing.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.320]   Just a huge part of the culture.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.280]   And I think it's incredible to witness.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:14.000]   I think you haven't lived till you've tried
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.600]   to cross a road in Hanoi during rush hour
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.800]   and felt the adrenaline rush of that.
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.040]   The trick is to keep moving
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.400]   and don't make any sudden movements.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.160]   Motorcycles will go around you.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.600]   Yeah, it's just, I mean, again,
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.680]   another common thread I think
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.960]   between some of these places I'm picking
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.240]   is just cities that feel so alive
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.040]   and you can't help but get caught up in that feeling
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.280]   and the current of the place
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.440]   and kind of places where you can just sit down
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.320]   on a plastic stool and sip a coffee
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.600]   and watch the world go by.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.880]   And it's incredible to witness.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:45.920]   So that would be one.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.040]   Trying to think of,
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.920]   I can think of something maybe nature-based
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:50.960]   for the other one.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.560]   I'm gonna say Siberia.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.520]   I think now, obviously, is not the time to go
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.040]   for geopolitical reasons,
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.880]   but if things with Russia ever change,
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.120]   the area around Lake Baikal,
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.440]   which is the deepest lake in the world,
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.920]   is otherworldly.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.160]   There's an island called Olkhon Island.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.760]   Absolutely otherworldly place.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.280]   You feel like you're in a dream,
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.720]   especially if you go in the fall,
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.400]   where Edwin and I went.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.520]   All the trees are bright yellow
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.400]   because of the changing foliage.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.880]   Wild horses in random corners.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.520]   Long stretches with no humans in sight.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.600]   Just really feels like you died
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.800]   and gone somewhere else.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:30.840]   - I struggled with this,
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:31.680]   and then I was like,
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.640]   "Oh, well, I guess the Middle East is in Asia."
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.120]   So I'm gonna,
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.120]   I have two.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.280]   One is, like your Siberia,
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.320]   Syria was one of my most memorable places to travel.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.000]   Would also probably not go there right now,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.720]   though there are reports of people traveling there.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.720]   But we also went to Lebanon,
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.720]   which I thought was just a wild, interesting place
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:57.520]   that both felt like it had the longest history.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:58.400]   We went up to the mountains.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.920]   We went hiking in the mountains.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.880]   We went to a ski resort in the summer
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.120]   and hung out there.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.760]   There's all of these,
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.000]   I think they're like monasteries
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.840]   surrounding this valley.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.560]   You could basically see every season,
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.200]   every style of architecture,
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:16.760]   every style of experience
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.800]   from the mountains to the beaches,
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.160]   all in a very small country.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.880]   We drove around the entire country.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.400]   We drove to the South.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.440]   We got calls from our friends in Beirut saying,
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.840]   "You're not supposed to drive that far
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:27.840]   "as an American tourist.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.440]   "That's not a good idea."
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.880]   We never actually felt unsafe
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.800]   as much as people told us we were.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.680]   And then the most interesting thing to me
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:39.200]   is that there's this weird amalgamation
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.520]   of French and English and Arabic
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.400]   that exists in the country.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.000]   And you'll hear people using all three languages
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.320]   in one sentence,
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.400]   which is something that,
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:50.240]   I don't know,
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.080]   you just don't hear it that often.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.640]   And I only speak two of the three languages.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.680]   So I could understand like 2/3 of what's going on.
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.040]   And it seems like they get combined
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:02.080]   in the calmest and the most aggressive circumstances.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.440]   So it's when people are just saying, "Hi."
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.360]   It's like, "Hi, (speaks in foreign language)."
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.320]   And then when people are angry on the street,
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.800]   cursing out of their car windows,
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.160]   you catch like bits of every language also.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.800]   So, but it's a beautiful country.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.400]   It has modern size.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.640]   It has lots of remnants of wars and buildings.
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.800]   I'm looking, your common theme was whole fish.
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.120]   I was like, "Gosh, I went to Bosnia."
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.560]   There's lots of buildings that have been bombed.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.400]   I went to Lebanon.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.400]   - It's amazing to see places that bounce back
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:31.120]   after those situations, so yeah.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.440]   - So Lebanon was amazing.
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.280]   And then, I've mentioned Japan a million times,
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.520]   but I think it deserves to be on the list
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.120]   and is probably gonna be the place
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.640]   I will travel to more than anywhere else in the world,
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.920]   just 'cause we always keep wanting to go back.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:49.800]   - Yeah, yeah, I agree with that for sure.
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:50.800]   - But maybe I'll ask you this.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.920]   You've been to Japan.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.680]   What are some places outside of the,
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.440]   we've done, as we expand Japan every time,
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.360]   we're like, "Let's go to a new place.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.320]   "Let's go to a new place."
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.760]   Any suggestions?
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.160]   - I mean, I loved the area around Kanazawa
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.800]   and Shirakawago, I think, is that little village
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.360]   in the mountains in the Japanese Alps
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.640]   that looks like it's out of a fairy tale
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.160]   with the sloped roofs.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.400]   It's unreal.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.280]   We went there in the summer
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.960]   and it was just like dream world.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.040]   And I think the trick there is people,
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.720]   it gets touristy during the day
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.600]   'cause a lot of people come on day trips,
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.400]   but hardly anyone spends the night.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.480]   So if you spend a night there,
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.680]   you really feel this village
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:29.040]   that feels like it's from another time.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.760]   And I also loved, I went to the area
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.160]   around the Seto Inland Sea,
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.560]   like Setouchi around Takamatsu,
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.720]   for the art triennial that happens there.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.000]   I think this one, I wonder if they've postponed it again.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.720]   I don't know, 'cause the last one was 2019 when I was there.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.880]   And that's just very cool
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.400]   'cause you have these little islands
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.680]   and each island becomes basically an outdoor art gallery.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:52.640]   And so you take the fairies around from island to island
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.760]   and you're just like in this alternate reality
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.520]   where there's sculptures everywhere
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.400]   and everything's a museum, basically.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:01.800]   Really special, special art event
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.480]   that happens in that area.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.280]   So those would be my outside
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:09.080]   of the common path recommendations.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.400]   But all that being said is,
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.680]   I think I've only been to Japan twice,
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.360]   so I've got a lot more to see in the years ahead.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.960]   - Yeah, we had another travel journalist,
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:21.800]   Brandon Presseron,
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.960]   who actually wrote the "Lonely Planet" Japan guide.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.840]   And so go back and check that episode out
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:27.680]   or reach out to him.
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.120]   He has like every tip on earth for Japan.
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:32.960]   I'm trying to think.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.040]   I feel like there's just more,
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.840]   like Taiwan needs to be on the list.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:40.920]   I mean, India, I mean, like there's half the world,
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.560]   I mean, more than half the world, right?
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.560]   - Yeah, I can't think of...
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.400]   There are very few...
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.440]   I loved Cambodia.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.960]   I could just go through this long list
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.880]   and there's just the food and the people.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.120]   It's just incredible.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:56.240]   And I feel like half the world goes to Lebanon
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.280]   and half the world ends up going
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.440]   on a similar experience in Israel.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.800]   And I've done both and they're both fantastic.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.980]   So I think go to Lebanon first
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.520]   because I don't think you want the Israeli stamp
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.000]   in your passport going into Lebanon.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.560]   I don't think that that works well.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.440]   So if you're debating between the two,
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.680]   I would start in Lebanon and do Israel next
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.000]   or just make sure you don't get the stamp in your passport.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:19.840]   But also make sure--
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.160]   - Most of the time they won't stamp your passport these days
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.800]   'cause they know in Israel.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:27.240]   - But someone we were with had the sticker
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:28.320]   on the back of their passport.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.640]   It's like they didn't stamp the passport
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.480]   but they had like a little sticker.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.920]   - A security sticker, yeah.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:34.760]   - And it was not a fun border crossing for them.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:38.220]   So, but gosh, I don't know.
[01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.780]   The food is like the highlight of the Middle East for me
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:41.980]   and the people.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:45.240]   So eating with strangers is like my favorite thing
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.420]   to do there.
[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:49.300]   I'm gonna let you take everything.
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:50.820]   I don't know whether to call it Oceania
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.900]   or Australia feels very biased
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:54.220]   to call the continent Australia,
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:56.540]   though I think that's what I grew up learning it as.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:59.580]   And Antarctica because my experience in that whole area
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:02.740]   is just like a one week city tour of Australia.
[01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:04.300]   So I'll let you take both.
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:08.400]   - So for Australia, Oceania, whatever we wanna call it,
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:12.300]   I'm gonna say South Island of New Zealand.
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:13.420]   It's not news to anyone
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:15.220]   that it's one of the most beautiful places in the world,
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:18.560]   but I would encourage people to look at the Great Walks,
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:22.220]   which are a collection of different trails
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:24.420]   that New Zealand has created over the past
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.500]   however many years, I don't know how many years.
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:30.060]   And there's new ones being added every few years,
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.900]   but they're basically like multi-day treks you can do.
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:35.260]   And I would look for those in the South Island.
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:37.340]   I can't think of a better way to see that nature
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:39.060]   than by foot.
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:40.820]   And a lot of them have like,
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:41.820]   some of them are pretty rugged
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:44.020]   in terms of back country backpacking,
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:47.180]   but a lot of them also have like huts along the way
[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:48.080]   that you can reserve
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.740]   so you're not fully exposed to the elements.
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.780]   But just, I've only done sections of them
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:54.660]   and never overnight.
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:57.340]   I've only explored them kind of as part of a story
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:00.060]   when I was looking around at different trails.
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:00.960]   But I would love to go back
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:04.800]   and do one of the Great Walks multi-day treks.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.720]   So that would be my tip.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.440]   But anywhere on the South Island,
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.300]   especially along the West Coast of the South Island
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:15.300]   is just, in one day you go from rainforest to glaciers
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:20.000]   to alpine terrain and it's mind-boggling.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.200]   You don't even understand how a place like that exists.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:25.160]   So that would be my tip for Oceania.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.640]   And then, I mean, Antarctica.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:29.360]   There's not a ton of options.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.800]   My advice for Antarctica would be
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:35.080]   the smaller ship, the better.
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.000]   You're getting there by ship
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.320]   unless you're Elon Musk trying to get a private jet
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:40.800]   to the South Pole or whatever.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.160]   But you're probably getting there by ship.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.300]   So smaller ship, the better.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:46.540]   And I think part of that is understanding
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:48.680]   the rules around tourism to Antarctica,
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:49.640]   the environmental rules,
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:52.280]   including the fact that only 100 people
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:55.000]   are allowed on land at any one time
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.760]   in terms of landing sites.
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.240]   So what that means is if you're on a ship
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.960]   with 700 people, you're not gonna be able
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.160]   to go out on every landing
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.720]   because they can only have 100 people at a time.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.520]   If you're on a ship with 100 people,
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.080]   you're getting to go out every time.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.200]   So that would be my tip.
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.120]   The smaller ship, the better.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.600]   You just have a better experience that way.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:12.960]   And my other tip would be like,
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.560]   don't even look at the luxury amenities
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.280]   offered on the ship because you're in Antarctica.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.040]   And if you wanna spend that time
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.380]   face down on a massage table,
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:22.120]   you're missing the point of being in Antarctica.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:25.440]   So go for the operator that you think
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.440]   is gonna give you the best actual experience
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.200]   on the ground, maximizing your time
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.680]   and interaction with a place
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.240]   that is the closest I think I'll ever get
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.720]   at least to being on another planet
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:37.720]   'cause it is just unreal.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:42.100]   I don't have words and my job is words.
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:46.040]   But actually I wrote like 3,000 words on it.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:50.080]   So you can read about it at lonelyplanet.com.
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.640]   - Yeah, I'll link to that in the show notes.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.520]   Any other parting travel advice
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:57.400]   I know we went over before we take off?
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:00.520]   - I do wanna reiterate that like at the end of the day,
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.160]   don't get too attached to the where.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:04.120]   Don't get too attached to a list
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.200]   that you've given yourself.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:07.360]   I mean, it's nice to dream and it's nice to imagine.
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.320]   It's nice to research and think about these places.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:12.080]   And sure, maybe it's nice to write it down too.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.840]   But I think the bucket list
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:17.320]   as we've long thought about it is a thing of the past.
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.600]   And I think we need to start thinking
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.040]   in terms of experiences.
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:20.880]   I think we need to start thinking
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.920]   in terms of exchange instead of just enrichment.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.280]   I think we need to start thinking
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:30.960]   in terms of just having the best experience.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.520]   And that can happen in your own backyard.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:35.400]   And that can happen in places where not everyone is going.
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.280]   And it can happen at the time of year
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.120]   that not everyone is going.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.400]   I don't know why we all have to go
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:43.320]   to Europe in the summer and Mexico in the winter
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.640]   and whatever else.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.480]   I think death to the bucket list,
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.320]   death to the low season, death to the high season,
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.640]   all that stuff I think is things of the past.
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:54.200]   And we need to start thinking differently
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.800]   in terms of why we travel
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:58.800]   and think less about where we travel.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.880]   - I agree.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:02.680]   The high season is just sometimes a worse experience.
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.600]   Like you get the great weather,
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.640]   but you don't get everything else
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:07.920]   and it's twice as expensive and awesome.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.080]   Where can people read what you're writing,
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.320]   see what you're seeing
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:15.080]   and follow you along all your adventures?
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.080]   - Yeah, so these days I'm writing exclusively
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.400]   for Lonely Planet where I'm editor at large.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.680]   So you can find my work there
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:23.120]   if you search my name in Lonely Planet
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.120]   or just go to the website, look around a bit.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.560]   We've got a lot of other great content there.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.760]   In terms of like my personal content,
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.080]   I'm @sebmodak, S-E-B-M-O-D-A-K
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.520]   on Instagram and Twitter where I often upload
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:38.400]   my latest stories and share photos
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.160]   and everything else for my travels.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.280]   And there's a few other things in the works,
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:43.440]   potentially a newsletter
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:45.760]   and some other kind of things that I'm working on.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.960]   So just follow me on those social medias
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.800]   and you'll hear about them
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.800]   and you'll hear about where I am
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.400]   and where I'm going next.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.480]   - I really appreciate it.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:56.320]   I have a long list that is not a bucket list,
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.160]   but a long list of things to be inspired by.
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:02.640]   And I'm excited for more travel to come in the future.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.520]   - Yeah, no, thanks for having me on.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.320]   I think, you know, hopefully there's some takeaways here.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:08.760]   I know it's not as like concrete
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:09.920]   as some of the people you talk to
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:11.880]   who are like, you need to do this for a rental car
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.560]   or this for a credit card or whatever else.
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:17.320]   I know it's different to be talking in these esoteric terms,
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.360]   but I do think it's important
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:22.080]   and I appreciate you having me on and chatting about it.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.000]   - Yeah, thank you so much for being here.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:24.840]   - Cheers.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:30.840]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:34.240]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:37.640]   (upbeat music continues)
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:40.720]   (upbeat music fades)
