[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.680]   They don't see the dangers.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.640]   I think a lot of the parents, Sam, that I talk to
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.640]   think that school now is a lot more like school was
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.720]   when they were in school than it is.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.520]   And they don't see the danger partly
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.200]   because they don't explore it and they don't want to know
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.840]   because that would demand that you make a difference.
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.000]   A different decision that you have to change.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   But I think that people don't recognize the danger
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.880]   that public education, that modern public education
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.880]   is doing to our children and thus to our future.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.440]   - You know, part of the reason that they don't recognize it
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.880]   is because they don't recognize the damage
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.080]   that it's done to them.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.480]   - Absolutely.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.680]   - And if they do recognize the damage that it's done to them
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.680]   then they have some reconciliation to make
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.840]   between them and their parents,
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.960]   between them and their children so far.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.560]   Like there's so much damage to unpack
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.160]   and it's a difficult road.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160]   Like I understand that it's hard for people.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.920]   And they'd rather not look at it.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.960]   A lot of people are just focused on
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.040]   where's my next meal coming from?
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.600]   - Moving ahead, not looking back.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.720]   And if looking back is going to jeopardize my moving ahead,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.720]   then for a lot of people,
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.000]   they don't feel like they have the freedom to do that.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.440]   - Yep, fair enough.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.640]   - And so a lot of us who do,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.640]   a lot of us who do think, wow, a system...
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.160]   If I am saying I don't think I'm capable
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.960]   of homeschooling my children,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.760]   why would I send them to an institution
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.760]   that made me incapable of educating another human being?
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.200]   And so we do come out
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.040]   and we do pursue this home centered education
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.040]   and we reclaim our own educations as we go.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.820]   I mean, how did you learn to teach your children?
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.600]   - Well, I learned the wrong way, right?
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.760]   So, and I did it wrong.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.440]   And I don't say that, look, I don't mean much by that.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.080]   I did a grammar curriculum that involved a lot of writing.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.480]   And so I forced my firstborn to do all the writing.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.800]   And then when the second one came along,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.820]   I didn't force him to do all the writing
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.520]   because at that point I'd figured out it was a lot.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.460]   - This is not the best thing.
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.360]   - Once you go through it once, you're like,
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.640]   well, wait a minute, we don't have to do all of that stuff.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.260]   Like, thanks, but no thanks.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.080]   So, but then again, my firstborn has written
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.720]   and published a book and my second child has not.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.220]   - There you go.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.720]   - I don't know, maybe there's some math to do on that.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.740]   - Right.
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.740]   - So I guess I figured it out as I went along.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.560]   I know a lot more now than I did before.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.380]   I've become much more brash.
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.600]   I didn't realize how damaged I was by the system.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.280]   I didn't realize, I thought that it was just the school
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.080]   where I was just wasn't that good,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.740]   but other schools might be good.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.380]   Now I understand it's the system of schooling
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.920]   that is the hazard for our children.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.740]   That's why I say just don't institutionalize healthy children
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.940]   like that's insane.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.640]   And we should see it as insane.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.560]   The only reason we don't see it as insane
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.420]   is because everybody does it.
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.280]   But everybody used to, I don't know, shave their heads.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.120]   - Right.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.220]   - Like everybody used to sacrifice their children.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.260]   Well, I guess we still do that.
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.740]   Everybody used to something, right?
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.700]   Just because it's popular doesn't mean that it's right.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.620]   Everybody used to wear floods.
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.460]   - That was it.
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.780]   - That was the popular thing to do
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.340]   was to roll your pants up so your ankles showed.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.980]   - Yeah.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.500]   - Now loafers with no socks is like the new thing.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.320]   And there are a lot of people who adopt that.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.680]   And there are still a lot of people who say,
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.660]   "No, that looks weird.
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.800]   "I'm not doing that."
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.380]   (laughing)
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.380]   So I think part of education,
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.420]   and for instance,
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.880]   I don't think education should have the modifier Christian.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.780]   It shouldn't need that.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.860]   It's either truth or it's not truth.
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.500]   And if it's truth, then it's Christian.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.980]   - Then it's Christian.
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.060]   Right, 'cause all truth is God's truth.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.460]   - But education ought to be pursuit of truth,
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.580]   beauty and goodness.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.020]   And as long as you're pursuing that,
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.540]   you're not gonna be distracted.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.980]   In fact, I would go so far as to say our schools
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.140]   and what they offer are only distraction.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.820]   So why would we want our children in that?
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.200]   - Right, 'cause they're pursuing other things,
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.180]   not truth, beauty and goodness.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.220]   - Right.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.500]   - Yeah. - Exactly.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.860]   - Not freedom.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.180]   Well, let me ask you this.
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.180]   I know that when we homeschooled,
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.280]   I learned at least as much as my children.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.120]   And I'm not talking about just academically.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.060]   I mean, there were lots of things that I had learned
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.220]   in my public school and in my private college.
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.220]   And I would have said I was a pretty smart girl.
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.060]   - But there are a lot of things that I learned
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.060]   along the way of homeschooling about God,
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.940]   about his word, about his world, about myself,
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.580]   about my children, about the truths
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.400]   that he was trying to teach me.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.300]   What did homeschooling teach you?
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.220]   - It taught me that I was enough.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.300]   It taught me to be a better parent.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.860]   Oh, this is huge.
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.420]   When you send your child into an institution every day,
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.820]   you begin, it necessarily, it just happens,
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.100]   you begin to abdicate your responsibilities as a parent.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.100]   And there's a chapter in my book about this,
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.780]   They're Your Kids, where I talk about
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.620]   everything becomes a learning opportunity.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.520]   And my goodness, if that isn't the joy of life.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.040]   - Yes, yes.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.620]   - It isn't teaching a child something.
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.380]   I don't know where you get your joy,
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.620]   but boy, that is your joy to me.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.340]   So I distinctly remember teaching my child
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.500]   how to answer somebody who says, how are you today?
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.340]   - Yes.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.980]   - Because she just looked at them
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.980]   and kind of whispered, fine.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.780]   She was so shy.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.460]   And I said, actually, when somebody asks you
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.100]   how you're doing, the proper way to answer them
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.120]   is to say, I'm fine, thank you, and how are you?
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.960]   - Yes.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.400]   - Go ahead, try it right now.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.280]   And the woman was kind of like,
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.340]   well, that's not what I signed up for,
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.980]   but okay, we'll go with that.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.340]   And my daughter said, I'm fine, thank you, how are you?
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.420]   And the woman played along.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.340]   Well, I'm fine, thank you so much for asking.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.340]   What a sweet young girl.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.100]   Like she totally played along.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.940]   - Yes, yes.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.640]   - The next day it happened again.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.460]   And my daughter quick as a whip said,
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.860]   I'm fine, thank you, how are you?
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.340]   And the empowerment in her, just from that,
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.600]   and guess what, I'm the hero because I taught her that.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.440]   - Absolutely, I love that story.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.240]   I love that story.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.120]   We used to practice before birthday parties.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.680]   Okay, birthday parties are fraught with peril
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.600]   when you were an outspoken child like I had.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.520]   And so we practiced before birthday parties.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.600]   Okay, if you open the present from your friend
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.860]   and you hate it, what will you say?
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.680]   What do you say if you open a present you don't like?
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.800]   What do you say if you open the present
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.740]   and you already have one?
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.940]   What do you say if you open the present
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.700]   and you just unwrapped one just like it?
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.260]   And so we would practice the response.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.720]   Well, what could you say?
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.240]   How would that make your friend feel?
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.280]   How can you say something true but affirming to your friend?
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.420]   And that's what homeschooling allowed us to do.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.960]   We practiced being kind people.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.180]   - Well, you used the word allowed,
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.440]   but I would even say it encouraged you to do that, right?
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.080]   It encourages better parenting
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.960]   because you recognize then
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.080]   the responsibilities on you 24/7,
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.840]   like you're not handing your child off to somebody
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.280]   to learn whatever.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.000]   - And if you don't teach them, nobody will.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   - Which by the way, Lisa, I don't recommend Sunday school.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.780]   I recommend to parents as of the age of three,
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.920]   I get it, if it's a baby and a toddler
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.320]   and they're just whatever
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.880]   and you really wanna sit in church, then fine.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.960]   But as of the age of three,
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.280]   your children can learn to sit with you in church.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.160]   - Yeah, yes, and then they learn what worship is like
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.400]   and what congregational singing is
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.000]   and what responsive readings are
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.220]   and they know why people stand up
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.640]   when we read the scripture at this church.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.960]   - More than that, they recognize
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.300]   because they see it every day,
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.980]   mommy and daddy take this seriously,
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.680]   this must be important.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.680]   There's a big transfer that happens
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.340]   when your child sits in church with you
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.440]   as opposed to you dropping them off for pizza
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.640]   or goldfish and veggie tails.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.480]   - Yes.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.320]   - And by the way,
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.400]   if you're dropping your child off at Sunday school
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.260]   and you're not asking the Sunday school teacher,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.520]   what did you cover today and drilling your child
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.360]   when you pick your child up, I started there, right?
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.340]   So I told you, like I did a dozen things wrong
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.440]   because I've learned so much since then
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.600]   that to do it again, I would do it differently.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   But I used to pick my kids up and I'd say,
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.880]   well, what did you learn in Sunday school today?
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.780]   And we actually had, the church was pretty active
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.640]   and they had some nice things going on,
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.480]   but it was never really that great.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.740]   And so when I started reading the Bible
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.860]   with my kids every day, I made them a deal
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.220]   because they really liked going and helping
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.100]   in the Sunday school at that point.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.180]   I said, okay, every other week you're in church with me.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.260]   - There you go.
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.620]   - And they appreciated that.
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.460]   It was really interesting.
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.580]   It was like this negotiation,
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.060]   well, mom, last week I was in church with you,
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.980]   so this week I do get to go to the,
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.180]   or well, I did help out in church last week,
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.620]   so this week I guess I'll be with you in church.
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.040]   But they liked that I was including them,
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.960]   like that I needed them or something.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   We don't value, I think we've forgotten
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.680]   how valuable we are to our children
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.820]   because of the culture has taught us
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.040]   that parents are superfluous or something along those lines.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.480]   - Or that parents and children, yeah,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.320]   that they have different interests
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.360]   and they don't belong together.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.000]   - And so when you are a part of your child's life
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.340]   in whatever, in all capacities,
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.460]   it extends to all facets, I guess.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:35.460]   So, but if your child is really interested in astronomy,
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.920]   you ought to take an interest in astronomy.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.660]   You're the adult. - Absolutely.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.200]   - Like you're the one driving the relationship.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.160]   So don't expect them,
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.960]   because you're the one driving the relationship,
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.960]   don't expect them to become interested in politics
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.320]   because you're interested in politics.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.040]   Although every child should have an interest
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.360]   in some of the politics that are happening
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.400]   because they ought to have a knowledge of current events.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.700]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.140]   - Like I was on the radio, so I had to read articles
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.000]   just to keep up with what was happening.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.940]   - What's going on.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.600]   - So I would print out the articles
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.440]   and I would have my children read me the article
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.040]   in the car while we were driving.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.000]   - There you go.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.640]   - Which was a great education for them.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.420]   They were forced to read big words
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.980]   and big sentences and stuff to me.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.720]   And then I would explain it to them
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.800]   so that they felt involved.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.640]   Like, you know. - With what you're doing.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.560]   Yeah, they're a part of your life.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.440]   - Right, these things are, this is the difference, right?
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.900]   Because your children then become a part of your life,
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.040]   like you've just said,
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.160]   in a way that the school actually actively prevents
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.480]   from happening.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   - Yes, yes.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.440]   They actually don't want parents to know the ins and outs
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.600]   of what we're talking about with your children every day.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.760]   - Well, that, but what I'm saying is just the idea
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.700]   that your child spends that much time away from you
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.760]   prevents this kind of relationship from forming.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.160]   But yes, the same for the other stuff.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.120]   The school is now, we're in charge.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.780]   Your children don't belong to you.
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.940]   That's why the name of my book is they're your kids,
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.800]   not anyone else's, they're yours.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.640]   - Yes.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.640]   - But the school maintains, nope, they're ours
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.580]   and you can't have them back, basically.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.880]   Like the states are now getting involved
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.240]   in separating children from their parents
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.760]   if the parents don't affirm.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.620]   - Terrible. - Are you kidding me?
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.300]   My children didn't get to decide
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.600]   what they were gonna have for dinner,
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.240]   much less their gender.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.640]   - I mean, my children didn't decide
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.440]   what books to check out from the library
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.320]   till they were double digits, come on.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.840]   - Exactly.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.340]   - I want, and I love what you're saying,
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.920]   that we are inviting our children into our lives
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.000]   because we're living our lives with our children.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.020]   We know what, we have connections with one another
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.360]   and with the pieces of one another's lives
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.640]   that we necessarily miss when our children
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.800]   are away from us six or eight hours a day.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.200]   - Right.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.800]   - That's awesome. - Right.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.640]   - That is so awesome.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.440]   - It's a deep dive.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:16.400]   It's funny because we have children.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.040]   I struggled to have children.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.260]   I went through a lot and it was hard
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.160]   and I finally had my kids, right?
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.380]   - Blessings, yes. - And then I turned them over
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.280]   to the school, well, my oldest, right?
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.200]   And that was hard for me.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.620]   There's a reason it was hard for me
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.040]   'cause I shouldn't have done it.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.920]   - Right, right, right.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.780]   - And boy, I'll tell you, like I said,
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.040]   I've said it several times, I did it wrong, right?
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.940]   So I did a year and a half of homeschooling
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.920]   and I loved it so much but I felt so insecure
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.020]   because I came to Christianity later in life.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.240]   I was not raised a Christian
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.180]   and I wanted my children to have that.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.020]   - Yes.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.400]   - So I put them in a little Christian school,
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.320]   a little classical Christian school.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.680]   It was a hybrid model.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.440]   So I was homeschooling two days a week
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.240]   and then they would go to class,
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.160]   well, maybe I homeschooled three days a week,
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.680]   they did two days in class, I can't remember.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.960]   And it was a disaster.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.420]   Six weeks in and I go and interview the teacher
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.100]   just to make sure that, honestly,
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.480]   I was talking to her to make sure
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.520]   that I was holding up my end of the bargain
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.200]   because I was the good student.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.220]   - Right, that you're matching up with what she's doing.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.220]   - Right, and she spent five minutes telling me
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.280]   how well-behaved my little boy was.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.600]   And I knew how well-behaved he was.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.440]   I raised him, he was a very well-behaved boy.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.220]   He was the self-punisher.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.820]   - Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.260]   - And I just kept thinking,
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.600]   I wish I was hearing that he was misbehaving,
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.580]   that he was asking too many questions,
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.740]   that he was too excited to be there.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.660]   - But he always wanted to be hands-on
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.240]   or he always wanted to talk about it
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.540]   or he always asked why, sure.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.440]   - That's what you want to hear about your children.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.120]   And she was telling me that.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.760]   And boy, I'll tell you the day that I dropped them off,
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.760]   the first day, I cried.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.760]   - Oh, absolutely. - Oh, absolutely.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.900]   - That might have been the second hardest day.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.840]   It's still not as hard as the debate day,
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.800]   but it was pretty hard.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.960]   And so I took them out after six weeks.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.000]   I was like, well, that was a failure.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.480]   And then somebody at one of my speaking events
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.080]   came up to me and said,
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.900]   "Wasn't it beautiful that God allowed you to fail
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.560]   "in that way to show you that you are enough?"
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.140]   - Oh, wow.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.920]   - And that set me free.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.760]   That was amazing. - Isn't that,
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.960]   that's a great way to look at it though.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.880]   - That is a very freeing way to look at it.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.840]   And then you were free to learn with your children
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.840]   and you were free to design this education
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:53.160]   that would really meet you where you were
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.280]   and meet your children where they were.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:01.280]   - So my daughter is, she's not inclined toward math,
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.280]   which is a hardship for me because I love math.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.120]   - Oh, wow, yes.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.060]   - And so her sophomore year, I finally said,
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:11.900]   "You know what?
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.600]   "I'm gonna stop pressuring you with the math."
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.640]   And I was tutoring her because I love math.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.280]   Why shouldn't I tutor her?
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.440]   But her brain works entirely differently
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.140]   than most people, I would say most people's brains.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.240]   She has a very different brain
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.280]   and it's not a typical math brain, certainly.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.300]   And so I decided to take the pressure off.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.260]   I said, "You do one lesson a week if you want.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.240]   "If you don't do it, I'm not even gonna check.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.580]   "I don't even care.
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.000]   "I'll give you the rest of the year."
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.080]   This was early on, so she had a year basically math-free.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.760]   She went back to it and started teaching herself math.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.720]   - That's beautiful.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.520]   - And the reason is because I took the pressure off.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.300]   There's no way to coerce learning.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.640]   Your child's learning has to be self-motivated.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.400]   And if you are standing over them with your finger out,
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.120]   admonishing them to learn whatever it is,
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:19.160]   I won't say it will backfire, but it is not as effective
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.080]   as allowing their innate curiosity to drive the boat.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.760]   - Yes, yes.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.640]   - Not beautiful, not freeing, not joyful.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.500]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.480]   I am looking down and am shocked.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.960]   We have been talking about this for an hour.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.440]   And I really, really wanted to talk
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.080]   about "Miracle in East Texas."
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.080]   I really want, so I wanna ask you about this movie,
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.880]   "Miracle in East Texas," because I think,
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.800]   especially now that all your new friends
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.760]   here on the Everyday Educator podcast audience
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.020]   will want to know what you've been up to,
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.680]   I want you to tell us about this story.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.380]   How did you even find out?
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:20.380]   'Cause all the trailers say it is a tall tale,
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.960]   but an absolutely true story.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.820]   So how did you find out about this story?
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:33.280]   - So the story came to us as a script already.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.120]   - Okay.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.000]   - And that's kind of the beauty of it.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.760]   We heard about the script.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.160]   We know the writer.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.960]   He's a brilliant writer.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.040]   He wrote the movie for Paul Newman and Robert Redford.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.040]   - Oh, wow, wow.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.580]   I can see them in those roles.
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.140]   - Yeah, yeah, really.
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.680]   They could never get the time right
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.020]   to do the movie together.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.940]   So it then went on a shelf and we know him,
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:00.780]   and so he brought it out.
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.320]   He said, "What about this?"
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.900]   And Kevin and I just fell in love with it,
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.900]   not realizing the magnitude of the story.
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.260]   And that's what's so beautiful about it
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.300]   is once we had done the movie,
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.820]   I started learning all the other parts of the story
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.280]   that weren't contained in the movie.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.580]   The movie itself is the nut of the story,
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.360]   but there was a lot that obviously
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.440]   couldn't be part of the movie
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.840]   'cause you can only tell--
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.140]   - So much.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.180]   - An hour and a half, right?
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.020]   - Yeah.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.860]   - So the story is of the East Texas oil strike,
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.820]   which was the largest oil strike in the history of the world.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.460]   This is big, big news, right?
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.160]   But it was discovered by these two scoundrels
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.720]   who weren't real oil men.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.340]   - And so they kind of discovered it by accident.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.000]   - They discovered it by accident.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.620]   And by the time they discovered it,
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.620]   they had oversold the well because that was what they did
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:03.020]   was they got people to invest in their oil drilling
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.360]   and then they would oversell it
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.860]   because they would never strike oil.
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.940]   It wasn't that easy to do.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.620]   And so they never believed that they were gonna strike oil.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.200]   - One of the funniest lines I saw
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.120]   was where one of the characters is saying,
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.720]   "We sold 500% of this.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.820]   "You can only sell 100.
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.100]   "You can only ever have 100% of a thing."
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.660]   That was hilarious to me.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.900]   - Right, and they had done it before.
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.780]   They oversold the well.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.360]   Then they would just say, "Well, it's dry.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.460]   "Thanks for your investment, but there's no return.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.420]   "Bye bye now."
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.620]   And then they'd move on.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:44.760]   But they ended up here in Texas and they struck oil.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.220]   So then they had to figure out
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.220]   because if they declared, if they brought the oil in,
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.980]   all of the investors were gonna come for the percentage
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.920]   that they owned, which would equal 500% of the well
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.360]   or five times the well, which, you know.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.480]   And so the true story is there's a guy named,
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.320]   there was a guy named Hunt at the time
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.920]   who became, he came in and he bought up all the shares.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.440]   Now, that was a very risky play.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.840]   He was a gambler of sorts.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.280]   He had been involved in oil.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.200]   He was no longer in oil, but he knew the business
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.560]   and he took a gamble and he went and he made a deal
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.520]   with every one of the investors.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.660]   - Wow.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.140]   - And gave them basically, not pennies on the dollar
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.600]   because they all became very wealthy in the end,
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.700]   but he gave them 1/5 of what they thought
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:38.880]   that they had invested.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.880]   He gave them, sorry, he bought up the shares that he could
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.680]   because some people just wanted to see their money back
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.140]   and for the rest, he made them investors,
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.320]   but at only 1/5 of what they thought that they had bought.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.760]   - Right, right.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.080]   - Or something, he worked the deal.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.640]   In any case, he just worked a deal with everybody
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.200]   and brought the oil in.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.040]   And if you fast forward 10 years,
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.640]   that is the oil that helped us win World War II.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.580]   - That is so amazing.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.520]   - That is why the German tanks ran out of gas
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.680]   before the Allied troops tanks ran out of gas.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.840]   - Man, that is an inspiring story.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.440]   No, I never heard that.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:27.440]   - Because the oil was shipped through the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:35.720]   There were German U-boats in the Gulf of Mexico
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.080]   and they torpedoed 72 out of 73 tankers.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.280]   Think about that, that's a lot of tankers
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.800]   that got torpedoed by the Germans
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.040]   because the Germans knew the value of that oil.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.060]   So then we built a pipeline.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.080]   In less than 14 months,
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.920]   we built a pipeline from Texas to the East Coast
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.200]   and that's how we ended up getting our oil over there
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.320]   and that's why Winston Churchill even agreed
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.200]   that the Allies "floated to victory
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.560]   "on a sea of East Texas oil."
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.120]   So that's the importance of that oil field
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.680]   and the significance of that story,
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.740]   the fact that God...
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.740]   Oh, and the miracle was not the discovery of the oil.
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.680]   The miracle was the redemptive story
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.620]   that we tell in the movie.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.160]   I don't want to spoil the entire movie.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.320]   - No, don't spoil it, yeah.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.720]   - Because people should see it.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.600]   But the joy of all of that is that
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.940]   when I discovered all that, I'm like,
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.200]   well, this should be a homeschool curriculum.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.880]   So I made a homeschool curriculum based on the movie.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.640]   So you can watch the movie with your kids
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.680]   and then have an economics lesson,
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.120]   a history lesson, a little bit of math.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.700]   It's a whole curriculum.
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.720]   It's very short.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.380]   It's not a big deal, but it's a lot of fun to do.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:00.000]   And you start to realize this was supposed to be...
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.240]   I'm using it as basically part of a homeschool starter kit
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.080]   that I'm offering for families
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.620]   because I want them to understand that as parents,
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.640]   they have a great deal of value.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.900]   Their life experience and their knowledge
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.200]   is not to be diminished
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.900]   just because they don't have a college degree
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.640]   or because they never got the gold star in math class.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.660]   They have a lot of value to bring to their children.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.720]   And one of the ways that they can be shown their value
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.620]   is by watching the movie with their kids
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.100]   and then just doing the curriculum with their kids.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.720]   And in that way, they can see how much they really do have
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.000]   that they can share with their kids as a home educator.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And so that was my idea was to help parents recognize
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.960]   how easy homeschooling is and how rewarding it can be.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.880]   - That is awesome.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   I love it that you found a story that was worth telling.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.000]   This is definitely a story worth telling,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.520]   but then you're using it as a vehicle
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.380]   to start amazing conversations with your students
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.640]   about things that you've experienced together.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.940]   You've experienced this movie together.
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.000]   Now let's mine it for all it's worth.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.760]   Let's talk about all these different lessons.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.280]   And you're right, when we do that with our children,
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:24.280]   we see that we do have the quote unquote credentials
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:29.580]   to be teachers of our children because we have thoughts
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.960]   and we can communicate and we can wrestle down
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.800]   the ideas together.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.980]   That's very empowering.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.980]   There's something so special about a good story too.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.920]   Why do you think stories are so powerful?
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.480]   - Oh, I don't even ask why.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.960]   I just know that they are.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.260]   Jesus was a storyteller.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.980]   The why is because we were created really
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.680]   to seek out the story.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   What's funny is people are under the misapprehension,
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.920]   let's say, because they went to school,
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.080]   that science is anti-religion.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.640]   Science is religion affirming.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.660]   And why do I say that?
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.560]   Because the only reason that science exists
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.960]   is because of man's innate desire
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.500]   to understand the world around him.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.700]   That's the creation of the scientific mind,
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.480]   is this desire to understand the world around him.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.720]   Well, who put that desire there?
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.560]   God.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.480]   And what is man trying to understand?
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.000]   God, because God created everything.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And so science is actually the act of seeking God.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.520]   - Yes, you're right.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.280]   You are absolutely right.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.360]   That is why we ask the questions
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.460]   and that is why science exists,
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:55.520]   because we have questions and we have curiosity
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.900]   and we are seeking the answers that, you know what,
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:03.540]   the cool thing is God really wants to reveal himself to us
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.380]   through his world.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.980]   So it's not like he's hiding the answers.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.700]   He wants us to know.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.320]   I do think there are mysteries that God reserves for himself,
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.440]   but by and large, I think he loves to talk to us
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.660]   about the mysteries of the world.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.800]   - Yes, and that's why so many scientists,
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.480]   the deeper that they go into their field of study,
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.540]   the more devoutly religious they become.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.760]   - Yes, yes, that is so true.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:32.600]   That is really true.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.720]   - Because the world tells you something else, right?
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.860]   - Absolutely, and we just believe it
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.200]   because that's what we've always heard
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.560]   and that's what we've always thought.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.920]   So what is it?
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.020]   I love the fact that you have this guide,
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.260]   this free discussion guide.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.160]   People can download this discussion guide
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.660]   and we're gonna put a link to that guide
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.880]   in our podcast show notes so people will have access to that.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:02.520]   What do you hope that families will learn
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.080]   from using this guide?
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.100]   I think that you pointed to a couple of things already,
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.160]   but I wanna give you the chance to say
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.820]   what is it that you hope families will learn
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:17.540]   by using this guide and watching this movie together?
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.120]   - So for the curriculum for the movie,
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:25.000]   my main point was that they learn that they can
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.800]   educate their children.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.280]   It's really that simple.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.280]   That's my entire mission is to emancipate parents
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:38.440]   from the enslavement that our schools have forced on them.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.560]   They are slaves to the system.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.660]   Any parent who says to you, "I couldn't homeschool my kids,"
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:50.140]   on a level is beholden to the school.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.380]   - Yes, yes.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.680]   - And whether it's economic slavery
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.960]   or just enslavement in the mind, it doesn't really matter.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.640]   Like it matters and the solution obviously needs
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.220]   to address the cause, but yeah.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:09.220]   So my plan is to get as many children out of school
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:15.520]   because when you set them free, then they love freedom
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.680]   and they will try to preserve it.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.320]   And that's what we need these days
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.500]   because we are slowly being enslaved by the entire system.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.920]   I don't know how to put it any less bluntly
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.180]   than that, frankly.
[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.900]   And the only way we're gonna get out of this with freedom
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.160]   is for freedom-loving young people
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.840]   to be willing to fight for it.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.180]   - Yeah, yeah, I agree with you.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:45.540]   And that's kind of a grave note as we draw to the end
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:49.120]   of our podcast, that's kind of a grave note to end on.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.120]   But I think that it is true and I can tell
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.280]   that it is a cause that really resonates with you.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.160]   It is something that's very personal to you
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.720]   that you feel very deeply about.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.320]   That's very cool.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.440]   - Yeah, well, it's been the greatest blessing in my life.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.420]   The Bible tells us that children are a gift of God
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.920]   and the gift is given to you to open.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.600]   Don't think that you can give somebody else your gift
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.480]   and then that the gift will bless you, right?
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.320]   - Yeah.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:34.040]   - So that's my mission and well, not all of my books.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.700]   I mean, I wrote "Words for Warriors"
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:40.700]   because I'm tired of people taking our language
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.160]   and perverting it.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.760]   I think words have power.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.960]   God spoke existence into being.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.100]   So words have power.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.380]   There's a reason that the Bible said that God spoke.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.000]   He didn't draw it on a piece of paper
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.080]   and then it came into being, he spoke it into being.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.360]   Our words have great power
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.680]   and that is why there's a war on words.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.440]   And so I wrote "Words for Warriors"
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.640]   for people to understand our language
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.680]   and understand the words that have been obfuscated
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.880]   and perverted.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.880]   - Frankly, the idea that we've now got
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:21.140]   a Supreme Court Justice who cannot identify what a woman is.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.400]   - Yes, insane, insane.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.100]   - So and "Words for Warriors" I had a lot of fun with.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.680]   I'm pretty sarcastic in the book
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.680]   and in fact, even one of the definitions I wrote,
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.200]   duh, at the end of it.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.480]   - You know what?
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.700]   I think that I would love to be face-to-face with you.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.420]   If I was gonna write a long book,
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.160]   I would write, I write in the margins of all my books,
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.760]   comments like that, oh, really, please,
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:53.440]   and duh, I actually do, so that's very fun.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.640]   - In fact, I recorded it so it's audio as well.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.120]   People have told me how much they love listening to it
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.240]   in their car.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.040]   It's a good bathroom book 'cause it's like,
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.040]   it's just one word with the definition after the other
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.560]   but the definitions get pretty,
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.480]   some of the definitions get pretty gnarly
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.760]   and pretty hilarious, frankly.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.600]   - A little snarky there. - A lot of great notes
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.820]   in there so that was a little bit of a sidestep
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.160]   from my mission which is the education of children
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.420]   but in fact, it starts with the education of the parent.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.660]   - That's absolutely true.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.580]   - I don't have any effect on the child
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.600]   unless I can affect the parent and so that's my goal.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.160]   I have Teach From Love which is a school year devotional
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.420]   which trains your children in virtues
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.380]   and that's really what we want.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.020]   We wanna be able to have virtuous children
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.420]   but there's only, there are two ways of getting there, right?
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.860]   So the phrase is that things are caught, not taught
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.740]   but in fact, it's both and yes, they are caught, right?
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.740]   Your children will model your behavior,
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.880]   they will do what they see you doing.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.900]   - They're imitators. - But we also owe it
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.140]   to them to teach them and so that's what this book offers
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:07.700]   and at the same time, I wrote the book, it's a devotional
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.240]   so you've got a little story, you've got a Bible verse,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.320]   you've got a little summary
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.180]   and then it's always followed by two open-ended questions
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.180]   because the learning happens in the discussion.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:21.920]   That's why Classical Conversations
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.680]   has the conversations in its name
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.800]   because it's in the discussion that it gets cemented
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   and learned not just by the storytelling, right?
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.080]   And so there's that one and then there's the playbook
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.640]   for home learning which is just trying to get parents
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.340]   to think about what they really mean when they say education
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.260]   'cause they don't necessarily know
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.940]   because they went to school.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:50.980]   - Right, right. - And so they know
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.660]   what they mean by school but do they know what they mean
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.660]   by the word education because the two are not synonymous,
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.260]   not anymore, not ever really.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.580]   - And sometimes people know that they don't want
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:05.480]   to replicate what they had but they don't really know
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.460]   how to start thinking of it in a different way.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.100]   And so you're right.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:15.020]   If we really want to affect the children,
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:18.500]   we engage the parents and we give them the help
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.060]   and the support and some illumination
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:26.060]   of what education at home could mean to their family
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.220]   and to their children.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.700]   - Yes, and so that became a 15 video series.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.440]   - Wow, that's cool.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.900]   - Yeah, so it's like a whole course.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.000]   But it's fast, it's seven hours or whatever.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.240]   And then the book is basically just a notebook
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.280]   that goes with it.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.100]   And people seem to really love it
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.660]   so I'm very happy about that.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:51.980]   - That's so good.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:56.660]   - Because I can't tell you how it warms my heart
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.060]   to have people walk up to me and say,
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.640]   "I heard you speak three years ago
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.420]   "and we pulled our daughter out of school because of you
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.780]   "and we can't thank you enough."
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:08.140]   Like it's been the greatest thing for our family,
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.380]   that kind of stuff.
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.260]   - Man, did you ever think that you would have
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.420]   this kind of influence?
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.300]   When you were a young woman starting your own career,
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:21.740]   did you ever have an idea that you would affect
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:24.280]   so many families?
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.640]   - No.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.040]   - Isn't that amazing?
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.940]   Because God had that idea.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.920]   He knew always, Sam, that you were gonna do this.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.220]   - That was God's plan.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.940]   It wasn't my plan, but I'm very happy.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:40.160]   I started stepping out in faith about 15 years ago.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.260]   Oh no, I suppose it's longer than that.
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.860]   Yeah, I suppose it's longer than that.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.380]   But I guess I really sort of thought about it and said,
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.980]   "Okay, you know what, if I hear it from three people,
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.100]   "then I'm gonna trust it," that kind of thing.
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.740]   And I started hearing things.
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.540]   And I think if you just open yourself up,
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.940]   I think if you pray and you seek God's face,
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.140]   He will shine His face upon you.
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.900]   - That is lovely.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.980]   And that's the perfect place for us
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:15.300]   to draw this conversation to a close.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.220]   I have loved our time together.
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:21.320]   I feel like our listeners have loved getting to know you
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.900]   and your story.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.100]   Sam, I really appreciate you sharing your heart
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.860]   with us today.
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.020]   - I so appreciate being here.
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:29.940]   Thank you so much.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.980]   This will save me on my therapy bills.
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.020]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:37.020]   We've saved everyone a therapy week.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.060]   That's awesome.
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.720]   I do wanna let our listeners know
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.260]   that "Miracle in East Texas" is now streaming
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:50.220]   and you can engage this with your family.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:54.120]   You can use the discussion guide that Sam mentioned.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.080]   You can dive deeper into the themes
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.020]   and the colorful characters of "Miracle in East Texas."
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.920]   You can have some really thought-provoking conversations
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.660]   with your kids.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:09.360]   You can download the free discussion guide.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.280]   And it's a really long link name.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   So, listeners, the link is posted in the show notes.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.360]   So this is a perfect Friday night thing
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.880]   to do with your family this week.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.980]   Stream "Miracle in East Texas."
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.700]   Download the discussion guide and have at it.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:31.660]   Go and build some great conversations with your family.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.900]   Sam, thank you again.
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.060]   This has been great.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.140]   - Just before we jump off, because it is audio,
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.940]   I will tell people they can go to sorbostudios.com.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.900]   That's sorbostudios.com.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.400]   And sign up for our newsletter.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.220]   - Oh, that's perfect.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.140]   - It's the best way for us to stay in touch with people.
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.760]   You can find out what other Christian movies
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.700]   are coming down the pike.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.500]   And then you can find all the information
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.780]   about homeschooling and the movies at that site.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.740]   So there you go.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.820]   - That is super, and that, oh, that is super.
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.420]   Thank you, that's way shorter.
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.820]   I think I could even remember that
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.340]   without writing it down, sorbostudios.com.
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.180]   That's awesome.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.620]   All right, thank you, Sam.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:12.060]   And thank you, listeners.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.600]   And I will see you guys next week, okay?
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.680]   (gentle music)
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.180]   (music fades)
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:30.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
