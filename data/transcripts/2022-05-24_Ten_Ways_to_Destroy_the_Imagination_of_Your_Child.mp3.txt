[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.020]   A few years ago, a vandal seized some 40 or 50,000 books from my college's library.
[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.420]   He didn't want to read them, or even to sell them.
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.420]   He wanted simply to get rid of them, on the grounds that nobody would read them anyway.
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.860]   Some of the volumes he had branded for destruction were irreplaceable.
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.660]   I know because I went into the back room where they were being held temporarily before the
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.960]   trucks came to haul them away.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.080]   From that room, I saved several dozen, including a definitive dictionary of medieval Latin
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.760]   and the first great grammar book for Anglo-Saxon.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.960]   You know, the language that Beowulf spoke on the night when he was tearing Grendel's
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.920]   arm off, and the monster knew that his end was near.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.440]   "That was not a good day for Grendel," says the poet, deadpan.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.240]   It was not a good day for the books either.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.540]   There wasn't much we could do about it because the vandal in question made more money than
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.480]   we did and had a nicer office.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.400]   He was our librarian.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.720]   It's ironic but true that one of the qualifications of the modern librarian is a distaste for
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.720]   books.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.720]   They take up space.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.760]   And space, the librarians complain, is limited.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.080]   The books grow old, too.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.480]   Their covers fray.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.000]   The spines crack.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.280]   The pages go dog-eared.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.440]   Inattentive student workers stick them on the wrong shelves where they can practically
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.160]   disappear for years.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.680]   People borrow them and don't return them.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.920]   Some people, I'm guilty of this, underline favorite passages or write wry comments in
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.120]   the margins so that the book eventually becomes a kind of successive crime scene.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.160]   Here a priest wrote, "This is modernist heresy all over again."
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.720]   But over there an infidel wrote, "Church, enemy of thought."
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.320]   That is not to mention fingerprints and ink blots and even blood stains from crushed mosquitoes,
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.040]   I guess.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.020]   Books are bulky and inconvenient, like rocks and trees and rivers and life.
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.100]   It occurs to me that everything that can be said against the inconvenience of books can
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.260]   be said about the inconvenience of children.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.040]   They too take up space.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.080]   Are of no immediate practical use.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.160]   Are of interest to only a few people.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.280]   And present all kinds of problems.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.680]   They too must be warehoused efficiently and brought with as little resistance as possible
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.360]   into the digital age.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.120]   And there is the trouble.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.800]   A good book is a dangerous thing.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.000]   In the wrong hands it is like a bomb housed within a couple of red pasteboard covers.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.100]   It can blow the world wide open.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.400]   It can, if it's Dante's Divine Comedy, blow the reader as high as heaven.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.960]   It carries within it the possibility, and it is always only a possibility, of cracking
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.880]   open the shell of routine that prevents us from seeing the world.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.920]   Our days pass by with the regularity of a conveyor belt at an airport, which we duly
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.200]   get on and make our way with bland uniformity.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.460]   A book is like a mischievous boy sticking out his foot at the end of the belt, or like
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.500]   some fantastic intellectual machine that jolts us awake and we find that the belt is gone.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.120]   Instead we're riding in a stagecoach on a trail of dry ruts and half-naked Indians
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.980]   are surrounding us from the hills, bows stretched and arrows picked to fly.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.260]   That's bad enough already, but children are worse than books.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.980]   A book can make you see the world again, and so ruin your calm and efficient day.
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.700]   But a child does not need to see the world again.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.220]   He is seeing it for the first time.
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.660]   The Gospel of John reports that when Jesus cured that blind man at the pool of Bethsaida,
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.300]   the people around him asked him what he saw.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.000]   "I see trees walking," he said, looking at the men and women.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.500]   The child is like that, except that in his imagination the trees really do walk, and
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.940]   people really may grow branches.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.740]   Tolkien's Ents, the tree herders, are like slow, stately, moss-grown ancient oaks and
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.700]   maples and birches.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.540]   If oaks and maples and birches could talk, it takes them nearly a full day to say hello
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.440]   at their parliament.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.820]   The old Greco-Roman myth had Apollo chasing the virgin nymph Diana, and just when he was
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.260]   about to catch her in his arms, her wish to escape him forever was granted, and she was
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.460]   transformed into a laurel tree.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.200]   The child's world.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.620]   Because it is a fresh and new world, anything may happen.
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.580]   The fat frog on the lily pad is a Buddha.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.180]   The one-legged man stumping down the road to the nearest bar was once a pirate and killed
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.240]   three people in a quarrel over a game of rummy.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.380]   The house next door has eyes and a nose and a smokestack at the top.
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.060]   The girl who lives in it, the one with the yellow blouse, is an angel.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.820]   Obviously this won't do.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.140]   If we believe what we say, that children are our greatest resource, then we need to do
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.100]   something about it.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.820]   Resources are valuable because they are good, solid, dependable, and inert.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.820]   Aluminum is a resource.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.300]   Titanium is a resource.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.940]   If a block of titanium were suddenly to say, "No, I think I should not like to form an
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.820]   alloy with my friend aluminum to build the side of that airplane," and walked off the
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.520]   assembly line or the conveyor belt and bought a ticket on a ship to Athens, then it would
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.700]   no longer be a resource.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.980]   In fact, it would be a positive danger.
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.780]   It would be worse than useless.
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.380]   It would be an enemy of the people.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.860]   Granite is a resource.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.620]   If a block of granite at the top of an arch were to wriggle loose whenever people weren't
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.320]   around to notice, to drop on the head of the governor, we might swear off building with
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.300]   granite for a while.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.580]   Or we might use it all the more, but that is another matter.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.660]   In order for children to be transmuted into resources, then a tremendous alchemical change
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.960]   must be wrought in them.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.180]   The old alchemists of the early Renaissance sought the secret philosopher's stone, which
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.780]   would, in the right recipe, transform lead into gold.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.820]   We smile at their folly.
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.700]   We know full well that you can't transform lead into gold.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.940]   You can only transform gold into lead.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.700]   This book is written to show you how to do that.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.620]   The gold is nothing other than the child's imagination, which, if it is not gold itself,
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.140]   can still work the miracle of old King Midas.
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.500]   "Nature only provides us with a leaden world," wrote the poet Philip Sidney, "but it is
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.540]   the poet that makes for us a golden one."
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.060]   If we can but deaden the imagination, then we can settle the child down and make of him
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.340]   that solid, dependable, and inert space filler in school, and later, a block of the great
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.420]   state pyramid.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.900]   But we don't want that, my reader objects.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.420]   Yes, dear reader, you do.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.620]   Children make liars of us all.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.940]   Almost everything we say about them is a lie.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.260]   We believe exactly the opposite and act accordingly.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.380]   Suppose you are a lover of books.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.940]   You will not say, "Ah, books, yes, books are wonderful.
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.500]   Such treasures books are.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.380]   Myself, I don't have any, and I don't want any, or maybe just one, but I so love books."
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.140]   That's why you would have books strewn about your flat.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.020]   You would delight in their very bindings and the smell of their pages.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.020]   You would not know what to do without them.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.420]   You would not say, "Yes, I love books.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.620]   That is why I have warehoused them in this special room, far away from company and far
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.820]   from where I do anything of importance.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.340]   I keep them locked up behind this glass case and only take them out on special occasions."
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.900]   You would not say, "Books indeed are greatest resource.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.860]   They kindle readily and make excellent bonfires."
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.300]   If we loved children, we would have a few.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:06.100]   If we had them, we would want them as children and would love the wonder with which they
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.500]   behold the world and would hope that some of it might open our own eyes a little.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.380]   We would love their games and would want to play them once in a while, stirring in ourselves
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:21.060]   those memories of play that no one regrets and that are almost the only things an old
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.540]   man can look back on with complete satisfaction.
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.060]   We would want children tagging along after us.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:34.020]   Or if not, then only because we would understand that they had better things to do.
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.740]   Now that simply is intolerable.
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.900]   For the first time in human history, most people are doing things that could never interest
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.100]   a child enough to make him want to tag along.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.680]   That says less about the child than about us.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.420]   If someone should say to us, "How would you like to spend most of your waking hours
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.420]   five days a week for the next four years shut within four walls?"
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.460]   We should go mad, that is, if we had an imagination left.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:10.220]   It is only by repressing that imagination that many of us can stand our work.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:16.000]   Some years ago, American feminists in their own right, no inconsiderable Amazons against
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.460]   both childhood and the imagination, invented something called "Take Your Daughter to
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.460]   Work Day."
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.020]   "See, Jill, this is the office where Mommy works.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.820]   Here is where I sit for nine hours and talk to people I don't love about things that
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:34.780]   don't genuinely interest me so that I can make enough money to put you in daycare."
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:39.540]   Consider too the problems of the poor fellow who has to manage the human warehouse, the
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:45.980]   faraway sprawling school stocked with hundreds or thousands of pupils.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.940]   In the old days, let's say in a one-room schoolhouse, you could easily pick out which
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.860]   young lad or lass was blessed with a mischievous eye and a lively mind.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.580]   They were the ones hanging upside down from a couple of planks nailed up to a tree in
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.580]   the school yard, or sticking bubble gum on the radiator, or reading Ivanhoe.
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.700]   So you got them a few more planks and a bucket of nails, or a paddle to the rear end, or
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.260]   Waverly.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.660]   They could be dealt with.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.980]   But the bigger the school, the more dangerous and upsetting a single act of imagination
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:16.980]   can be.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.420]   The necessity to impose something like order rules it out.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:26.300]   A vast enterprise like McDonald's can only function by ensuring that no employee anywhere
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.060]   will do anything sprightly and childlike in the way of cooking.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:35.620]   I sometimes think that if a single boy at the grill tossed paprika into the french fries,
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.500]   the whole colossal pasteboard empire would come crashing down.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.340]   Barbarians everywhere would be grilling the onions, or leaving the ketchup out, or commandeering
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.220]   the Swiss to take the place of the American.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:54.460]   The great virtue of McDonald's, that of the solid, dependable, inert routine, would vanish.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:59.260]   As in what was once called life, you'd never know what you were getting.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.580]   We must then kill the imagination.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.700]   The ideal, of course, would be to cease having children, but that might have some adverse
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.740]   effect upon long-range economic prosperity, besides threatening certain industries with
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:11.740]   extinction.
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.660]   The manufacturers of tasteless clothing, for instance, and importers of refined sugar.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.020]   Since we must have children, we should be sure to subject them to all the most efficient
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.460]   and humane techniques to fit them for the world in which they will live.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.860]   A world of shopping malls all the same everywhere.
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.740]   Packaged food all the same.
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.700]   Paper pushing all the same.
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.220]   Mass entertainment all the same.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.820]   Books all the same.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.820]   We owe it to them, and what is more important, they owe it to us.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.660]   Now, we have been doing a fine job of this for many decades.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.420]   I will not, in this book, fail to give credit where credit is due.
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.260]   Far be it from me to claim, for instance, that I have invented daycare.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:56.220]   I confess that when I was a little boy, I'd have found the idea perfectly revolting.
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:02.140]   Nor can I claim to have come up with the soul-leveling notion that boys and girls are just the same.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:07.700]   I confess that when I was growing up, I was fascinated, frustrated, appalled, and thunderstruck
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.340]   to find them different.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.140]   But some people are born with genius, and others are but blessed with a knack for setting
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.340]   their superiors' inventions in some order.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.100]   I am, I'm afraid, of that latter sort.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:26.500]   Here now, for the first time, are ten sure ways to destroy the imagination of your child.
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.260]   I do not claim that it is an exhaustive list.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:35.060]   No doubt many of my readers, blessed with a keener attention to the needs of the child,
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.980]   will have come up with others.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:42.240]   But I am sure that a judicious application of even three or four of these methods will
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:50.340]   suffice to kill the imagination of an Einstein, a Beethoven, a Dante, or a Michelangelo.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.420]   Good luck!
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:58.260]   And if you, dear listener, are interested in learning those ten ways to destroy the
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:03.500]   imagination of your child, you will want to pick up a copy of this excellent book.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:09.980]   The author is Anthony Esolen.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.300]   And the title is "Ten Ways to Destroy the Imagination of Your Child."
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.540]   Again, "Ten Ways to Destroy the Imagination of Your Child."
