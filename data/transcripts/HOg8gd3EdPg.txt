[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   Well, now I want to call your attention to the words that will be found in Paul's epistle
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.320]   to the Romans in chapter 8, and reading the paragraph that comes immediately before the
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.520]   previous reading in the eighth chapter of the epistle to the Romans, beginning at verse
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.480]   18 and ending at verse 23.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.480]   "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.360]   with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.880]   For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.720]   of God.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.680]   For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.800]   subjected the same in hope.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.360]   Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.280]   the glorious liberty of the children of God.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.680]   For we know that the whole creation groaneth and traveleth in pain together until now.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.680]   And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:25.520]   ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.200]   our body."
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.440]   I suppose that there is no charge that is brought more commonly and more frequently
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.360]   at the present time against the Christian church and the Christian gospel and the Christian
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:51.160]   message as the charge of irrelevance, that it has nothing to say to this present hour.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   We are met together in a time of great crisis.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.720]   I needn't take any time in establishing that.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.960]   You can't listen to a news bulletin.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.320]   You can't pick up a newspaper without being face to face with a very serious crisis in
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.640]   which we find ourselves.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:18.240]   And there may be some in this congregation, as there are large numbers in the world outside,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.320]   who feel that to meet together as we are meeting tonight, to consider the message of this old
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.960]   book is almost lunacy.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.600]   The average man today outside the church speaks in this kind of way.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.640]   He says the times are cruel, the times are urgent, the problems are tremendous.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.600]   And what is the point of considering an old book and an old message such as the Bible?
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.280]   They feel it's quite outmoded, quite out of date.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.000]   They would agree that it would be a good thing perhaps a hundred years ago or a thousand
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.160]   years ago to meet together like this to consider the message of the Bible.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:14.860]   But they say, what has the Bible to say to this modern world at this very moment in its
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.920]   agonizing crisis and in its condition which seems to be approaching one of chaos?
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.400]   Now this is the charge, that it's completely irrelevant, that it has nothing to say.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.960]   Well now I want to deal with that charge.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.880]   And my answer is this, that it does deal with the present situation.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.880]   What is its message?
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   What's it talk about?
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.600]   Well here it is in the words I've just read to you, "The sufferings of this present
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.600]   time."
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.880]   That's its message.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.640]   But I can hear somebody saying, wait a minute, we are familiar with that old pulpit trick.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.240]   You mustn't delude us into thinking that what you've just read has any application
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.800]   to us.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.520]   That was written by the Apostle Paul in the first century.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.360]   And while what he says may have been perfectly true and opposite to the conditions in the
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.480]   first century, what are they to say to the twentieth century?
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.080]   No, no, it's right outmoded.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.040]   Well I can answer that charge again.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.560]   The sufferings of this present time, says the Apostle Paul, and we are concerned about
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.360]   the sufferings of this present time.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:43.160]   And my contention is that they're the same sufferings, exactly the same problems.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.440]   That is why the Bible is always contemporary.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.000]   It's always up to date.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Why?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.720]   Because it deals with the problems and the sufferings of mankind in this world.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.560]   And they never change.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.220]   But says somebody, what about splitting the atom?
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.640]   What about landing men on the surface of the moon?
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.920]   Are you arguing that the sufferings of today are the same as the sufferings of the first
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   century?
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.120]   Well that's precisely what I'm doing.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.400]   The fact that we can put men on the surface of the moon and so on does not affect the
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.240]   fundamental problems of man living in this world.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.120]   What are our greatest problems today?
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.960]   Well, there is unemployment.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.960]   There was always unemployment.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.360]   There was unemployment in the first century.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.520]   Inadequate wages, not a new problem.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.120]   Insufficient food for certain people has always been there.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.160]   It's a perennial problem.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.640]   But about the moral problems, well, they're still the same.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.160]   There is no single sin being committed in Glasgow tonight, but that you'll find it
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.720]   in the Bible.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.240]   The form may change, but the essential sin is the same.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.460]   What is the main cause of suffering in the world tonight?
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.240]   It is human sin.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:13.080]   Drunkenness, theft, robbery, dishonesty, greed, malice, selfishness, hatred, these
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.840]   are the cause of the troubles.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.760]   Wars, rumors of wars.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.120]   Now these have always been the problems of the human race.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.000]   They were in the first century.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.720]   They are tonight.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.280]   So my argument is that what the apostle had to say to these Roman Christians in the first
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:38.040]   century is as applicable tonight as it was then, and is as true tonight as it was in
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.120]   his day and generation.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.320]   And the theme is the sufferings of this present time.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:52.400]   So I argue that our message is contemporary, but I want to go further.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.160]   I want to prove to you and to demonstrate to you tonight that not only does the Bible
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:06.000]   speak to and about the sufferings of this present time in a manner that gives us understanding,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.440]   comfort, consolation, and above everything else, hope.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:19.560]   I not only argue that the Bible does that, I'm here to demonstrate that it is only the
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.280]   Bible that does that.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.560]   In other words, I'm not here to apologize for the Bible.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.600]   I'm here to say that the most relevant book in the world at this moment is the Bible,
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:40.440]   that it speaks to our condition at this very second in a way that nothing else does.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.600]   Nothing else gives us understanding, nothing else comforts us, gives us consolation, and
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.360]   above all, nothing else gives us hope.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.320]   Now, unless there may be somebody here who thinks that this is a sweeping acceleration
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.720]   characteristic of the pulpit, I think I can demonstrate what I'm saying.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.680]   Do you find any hope tonight from the politicians?
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.240]   I'm not here to renounce them.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   They are men facing a great task.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.920]   Do you get any comfort or consolation or hope from them?
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.760]   Well, I'd be rather amazed if there's anybody who says yes to that question.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   They seem to be bankrupt.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.160]   They are frightened men.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:33.200]   The problems are obviously beyond their understanding and elude any of their profit solutions.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.560]   The same applies to what is called humanism.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.440]   The people who dismiss the Bible and who dismiss Christianity, these clever gentlemen who appear
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.280]   on the television and so on, the humanists, have they got any hope?
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.800]   Well, I wish they'd tell us what it is.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.760]   They're entirely bankrupt.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.520]   And it's the same in the realm of science.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.800]   People have left religion, turned from Christianity for nearly a century now because they say
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.960]   they believe in science.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:11.040]   Science is going to solve all our problems instead of the kind of fairy tale or fantasy
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.160]   that you have in the Bible.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.640]   But do you find any hope from science tonight?
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.840]   Indeed, one of our major problems is the direct result of scientific discovery and the abuse
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.280]   of scientific knowledge.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:29.320]   And indeed, some of the most frightened people in the world at this moment are some of the
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.600]   greatest scientists.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:38.040]   They are alarmed at the terrible possibilities, such as genetic engineering, as they call
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.960]   it, that are facing us.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.840]   They've discovered so much about the cell and the genes in the cell that it's possible
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.800]   to manipulate human nature and human beings.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   They're terrified.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   They have no hope and no comfort and no consolation to give us.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.560]   But what about the world, the great world religions, says someone?
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.400]   There are people who are turning to Buddhism and to these Eastern religions and to the
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.920]   teaching of the various Indian mystics.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.360]   Is there any hope in them?
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:14.080]   Well, the answer is that every one of those so-called religions is a pessimistic religion.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.000]   They have no hope at all.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.360]   The only hope Buddhism has to give us is that eventually we'll be absorbed into the ultimate,
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.160]   the absolute, out of this world.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.040]   No other hope whatsoever.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.320]   Purely pessimistic.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:35.040]   And if you turn to the realm of what is called philosophy, the same is true.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.040]   So many people this century have turned their backs on Christianity because they say, "We
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.840]   want reason and understanding."
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.520]   So they've turned to what they call philosophy.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.760]   And no philosopher in this present century has been more famous or more greatly lauded
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   and praised than the late Bertrand Russell.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.320]   Do you know what he has to say about the position?
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.880]   Let me read it to you.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:09.440]   He wrote these words, "All the labor of the ages, all the noonday brightness of human
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:18.080]   genius are destined to extinction in the vast depth of the solar system.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:25.600]   And the whole temple of man's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.640]   of a universe in ruins."
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.480]   That's philosophy.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:36.640]   It has no hope or comfort or consolation whatsoever to give us.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.600]   Turn to any direction you like and you'll find it's bankrupt.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:51.360]   So my contention tonight is that this is the only message which speaks to our condition,
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:58.240]   gives us any measure of understanding, comfort, consolation, and above all, a hope face to
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.480]   face with approaching calamity.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.320]   Very well, that's my first proposition.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.640]   But let me go on to say this, because it's very important.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:15.160]   We've got to realize the nature and the character of the comfort and consolation and hope that
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.560]   are given to us by the Bible.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.320]   What I mean is this.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.640]   It's not something psychological.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.920]   It's not some vague, general feeling.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:33.320]   I have to say that for this reason, that people have often turned to the church when there
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:40.040]   have been troubles and crises because they want some comfort and consolation and hope.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.280]   When things go wrong, people tend to look to the church.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.280]   They want a bit of help.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.880]   They want some comfort and consolation.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.040]   And often they go away disappointed because they haven't got it.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.260]   And the reason they haven't got it is this.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:13:00.880]   That if you want the comfort and the consolation and the hope that the Bible has got to give,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.280]   you've got to take it as the Bible presents it.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:11.600]   You've got to take it in the terms in which the Bible offers it.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.360]   Now what I'm expounding is this.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.720]   The apostle says, "I reckon."
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.160]   Here he is writing to some Christians in Rome who were unhappy, they were miserable, they
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.360]   were enduring sufferings, the sufferings of this present time, Paul calls them.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.400]   And they couldn't understand and they were perplexed.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:36.160]   And the apostle wrote in order to help them, in order to comfort them and give them some
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.160]   hope.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.800]   And this is how he puts it, "I reckon."
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.240]   And what does that mean?
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:48.040]   Well this to me is one of the most important points that one can ever grasp and understand
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.680]   in connection with the biblical message.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:14:01.080]   You only get comfort and hope from the scriptures if you take them in the scriptural way.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.520]   It's no use coming to the church or to the Bible and saying, "I want comfort, I want
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.960]   consolation, I want hope, I want this, I want that."
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.880]   You can't do that.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.120]   It has nothing to say to you except in its own terms.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.320]   "I reckon," says Paul, "what's he mean?"
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.040]   Well another way of translating it would be this.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:31.280]   I come to the conclusion, I draw the deduction, I arrive by a process of reasoning at this
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.280]   conclusion.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.080]   What's he talking about?
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.400]   Well what he's saying is this.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:42.800]   He says, "You know, in the light of all I've been saying to you in this letter, in the
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.640]   light of all that, this is my deduction."
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.320]   Well what has he been writing about?
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.720]   He's been giving them a synopsis of the Christian gospel.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.160]   He tells them he wasn't able to visit them, he'd been hindered.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.120]   So he says, "Until I come to you, I'm writing you this letter to give you some general idea
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.880]   as to what the Christian faith is."
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.920]   And he's been expanding it in what are the first seven and a half chapters of this epistle
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.680]   as we are familiar with it.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:17.480]   Then having laid down his great doctrine, he says, "Now then, in the light of all that,
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.720]   this is what I've got to say to you."
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:29.040]   In other words, the comfort and the consolation cannot be extracted in and of themselves.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:35.000]   They are conclusions to the whole statement of the Christian faith.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.040]   Now so many people have never understood this.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.540]   They've thought of the church as a kind of dispensary.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.880]   And you go to the dispensary with your particular complaint, and you pick out a bottle of medicine
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.000]   and you take your dose, that's all you want.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.800]   It can't be done.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   If you want to know the comfort and the consolation that the Christian gospel has got to give
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.440]   you, well then, you've got to accept the whole of the Christian faith.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.440]   It's absolutely essential.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:09.040]   It is, as the apostle says, a deduction, a conclusion that follows from all the great
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.160]   and the mighty doctrine.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.520]   Very well.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.720]   What is this doctrine?
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.960]   What is the comfort that the gospel has to give us tonight?
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.560]   What hope have we in this modern world in its critical condition?
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:30.560]   Well let me just remind you as briefly as I can tonight of this great message as the
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.680]   result of which the apostle arrives at this conclusion.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.240]   This is the gospel message.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.840]   You start with this world.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.240]   Here we are in this world.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:48.440]   It's a world of trouble and a world of pain, a world of suffering.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:55.200]   Now before you begin to seek solutions, before you begin to seek some relief in this way
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.760]   or that way, the first question we should all ask is this.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.760]   What is this world?
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.760]   Where has it come from?
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:09.080]   It's no use tackling its problems without knowing what it is.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.480]   This is the tragedy of today, it seems to me, that the politicians and others are trying
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.360]   to find some instant solutions.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.760]   They have never arrived at a true diagnosis.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.640]   So you must start by asking what is this universe?
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.640]   Where has it come from?
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.640]   What is the world?
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.440]   Well, the Bible deals with this great question.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.080]   The apostle has been dealing with it in the earlier part of this great epistle.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.840]   And it is this, that this is God's world.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.960]   You know that's the greatest bit of consolation I know at this moment.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:45.320]   My greatest consolation face to face with the tragedies of this hour is that this is
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.320]   God's world.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.320]   It isn't man's world.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.700]   It isn't an accident.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.800]   In the beginning God created.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.520]   That's how it's come into being.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.080]   The world is not an accident.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.480]   You see, you'll never understand the problems of the world and the sufferings of this present
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.960]   time unless you go right away back and start at the origin.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.040]   The apostle does.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:16.240]   In the very first chapter he talks about the invisible things of God, of manifest, the
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.240]   creation.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.640]   He says, "Should be enough."
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.440]   Very well, it is God's world.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.800]   And he created a perfect world.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.760]   He made everything and he looked at it and he saw it was good.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.720]   And the very acme of his creation, of course, was man.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.100]   God said, "Let us make man in our own image and likeness."
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.840]   So man was perfect in every respect.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.040]   No defect, no blemish.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.360]   He put him in paradise.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.520]   He put him in a place where everything was also perfect.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.280]   The whole creation, including man, was absolutely perfect.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:58.680]   And man lived an idyllic life in innocence, in communion with God and enjoying God.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.240]   God had made man in order that he might have a companion.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.960]   And man was made for this fellowship and communion with God and he lived that wonderful idyllic
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.400]   life in the Garden of Eden.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.880]   Now that's the first proposition.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:22.600]   "Well, very well," says someone, "if that is so, why is the world tonight as it is?
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.000]   Why are there sufferings of this present time?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.960]   Why are we living in such a world of crisis and of trouble and of confusion and of pain?"
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.440]   My dear friends, this is the most important question a body of men and women can ever
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.880]   face together.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.680]   This is the question of questions.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.040]   What is the matter with us and with our world?
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:52.720]   And again I defy you to find any answer to that question apart from the one which is
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.680]   given in the Bible, the one which the apostle puts before us in this paragraph to which
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.400]   I'm calling your attention.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.920]   Listen to the way he puts it.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:08.360]   He says, "For the earnest expectation of the creature, the creation, waiteth for the
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.880]   manifestation of the sons of God."
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   Why?
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:20.360]   Well, the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.720]   subjected the same in hope.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:30.360]   We know that the whole creation "groaneth and traveleth in pain together until now."
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.400]   Now what does that mean?
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:37.760]   This is the apostle's way of giving comfort and consolation and hope to the Roman Christians.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.920]   It's his way of giving it to us tonight.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.920]   What's that mean?
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.640]   Well, what it means is this.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:49.560]   The apostle in those words is simply giving us an exposition of the teaching of the first
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.320]   three chapters of the book of Genesis.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:58.080]   If you want to understand the modern world and why it is as it is tonight, you've got
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.320]   to go back to the first three chapters of the book of Genesis.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.760]   Here is this perfect world.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.760]   Why is it so imperfect tonight?
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.660]   And there's only one answer.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:15.800]   It is because the perfect men in his folly listen to the tempter and the temptation and
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:23.440]   rebelled and rose in arrogance against God and defied God and told God that he could
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.640]   live a better life than God could ever give him, that he could become a God himself.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.320]   That's the whole cause of our trouble.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.080]   That's what Paul is saying here.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.800]   This is the message of the whole Bible.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:41.100]   And I say again that I defy you to give me any explanation of why our world should be
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:48.160]   as it is tonight, in spite of our multiplication of schools, primary, secondary, universities,
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:53.920]   further education, culture over the television and the wireless, multiplication of libraries,
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.920]   and all that we've boasted of so much for the last hundred years.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.600]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.560]   Here is the only answer.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:10.400]   The fall of man, man's original rebellion and sin, and the fall that he brought down
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.480]   upon himself.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.480]   What happened?
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.280]   Well, this is what we are told.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:22.760]   As a result of this disobedience and rebellion, man immediately got into trouble.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.600]   He'd never been in trouble before.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.880]   Here were the men and the women living this idyllic life in the garden, and the greatest
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:36.840]   moments in their experience were the moments when God came down to commune with them.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.880]   But now after their rebellion and their sin and their fall, they suddenly heard the voice
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.240]   of the Lord God in the garden in the cool of the evening.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.640]   And what did they do?
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.600]   Did they still rush to meet him with arms outstretched?
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.600]   No.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.120]   In terror and alarm they went to hide behind the trees.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:23:02.480]   For the first time they experienced guilt and unhappiness and a sense of condemnation.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.640]   But God called them out.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.960]   He said, "Adam, where art thou?"
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.360]   And he called them out and he spoke to them.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.120]   And he showed them what they'd done.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.240]   He'd already warned them that if they broke his commandments they'd get into trouble.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.080]   They've broken the commandment and they are in trouble.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.000]   And God told them the consequences.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.320]   He said, "Because you've done this, you've undergone a spiritual death.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.000]   That's why you're afraid of me.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.440]   That's why you regard me now as an enemy, someone who's against you.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.520]   You've become spiritually dead.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:37.000]   You've lost the link and the communion between yourselves and me.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.160]   Not only that," he says, "it isn't going to stop at this.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.720]   You've listened to this tempter.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.200]   You thought that what the tempter said was better for you than what I'd said to you.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.000]   But you know the result is going to be this.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.360]   You are going to experience now nothing but strife.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.600]   I'm going to set enmity between the seed of that serpent and the seed of the woman.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.120]   Your whole life," he said, "is going to be a life of struggle now and of enmity."
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.640]   And it came in, didn't it?
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.040]   Jealousy, malice, envy, spite, hatred.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:12.280]   You get it immediately in the story of Cain and of Abel, two brothers, children of the
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.280]   same parents.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:19.240]   Yet Cain is jealous of Abel and he murders him, the same as in Glasgow tonight.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.520]   It's been like this ever since.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.920]   Man's nature has fallen.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.240]   He's become polluted.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.600]   He's a sinful creature.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.320]   And all these horrible things which we can describe under the word enmity came into being.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:38.440]   And the whole of human history ever since has been one of strife and of warfare and
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:44.400]   of wars and rumors of wars and all the moral confusion and unhappiness.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.520]   Read your secular history books as well as the Bible and you'll find that that has been
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.320]   the sad, miserable, sorry story of the whole of the human race.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.220]   Not only that, man now becomes subject to death.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.160]   If he hadn't sinned against God, he would never have died.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.920]   He could have achieved immortality.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.880]   But now a seed of death enters into him.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.520]   His body begins to get older.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.920]   Decay comes in and he is subject to death.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.040]   And every one of us who comes into the world is beginning to go out of it the moment we
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.040]   come into it.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.360]   We've all got to die.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.640]   But death came in because of the fall.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:26.640]   Death passed over all men, as Paul has been explaining in the fifth chapter of this great
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   epistle.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:33.880]   Well now then, here is man, you see, fallen and in a miserable condition.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:39.520]   But not only that, God tells him that he's going to drive him out of paradise.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.360]   He's got to go out into the world.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.400]   What sort of a world is it going to be?
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.560]   Well God tells him immediately in the Garden of Eden.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:57.680]   Man you see, being made in the image and likeness of God, had been made by God the Lord of creation.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.320]   God had put everything under man.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:06.380]   He had the privilege of naming the animals and so on, and he was the Lord of creation.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.380]   Everything was under him.
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:12.280]   Now then, said God, when he came down after man's fall, he said a part of the punishment
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.420]   is going to be this.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:23.320]   I am going to curse the ground, because you are the head of creation, of fall.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.600]   Everything that is under you is going to fall with you.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.680]   Paul puts it in these words.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:36.480]   The creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who was subjected
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   the same in hope.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.480]   What's it mean?
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:44.900]   It means man had sinned willingly, deliberately.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.460]   The creatures, the creation, had not sinned willingly.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:54.760]   They have not sinned willingly, but because they are under man, a part of man's punishment
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.480]   is that the ground is cursed.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.180]   And God said, now there will be thorns and thistles.
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:06.060]   There were no thorns and thistles in the Garden of Eden.
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.260]   Man had simply to pick the fruit and to eat it, and he lived his wonderful life.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:16.780]   No longer, henceforth, says God, you will eat your bread by the sweat of your face.
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.500]   You are going to have a struggle.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.580]   The whole of creation and of nature has been made subject to vanity.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.060]   It's in a bondage of corruption.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.300]   You know this is true, don't you?
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.300]   Some of you, my dear friends, may be wonderful gardeners, and you are very proud of your
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.900]   garden, and you have every right to be.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.220]   But if you neglect that wonderful garden of yours for twelve months, you know what will
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.220]   happen?
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:42.020]   It will be covered with weeds and thorns and thistles.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.260]   It will go back into a wilderness again.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.060]   It's subject to vanity.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.820]   It's in a state of bondage.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.380]   It's against us.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.820]   And man can only live now by hard work and the sweat of his face and the sweat of his
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:55.820]   brow.
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.820]   Nature, it's red in tooth and claw.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:02.940]   Animals, predatory animals, living on weaker animals, the whole of nature is in a state
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.300]   of vanity, says Paul.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.100]   It's been made subject to it, not because it had sinned willingly.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.580]   This is a part of God's punishment.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:17.060]   God has subjected it to this because the Lord of creation, namely man, had sinned.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:26.660]   And so you see, the whole of human history, ever since that fall, has been what you and
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.740]   I are witnessing in an acute manner tonight.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:35.140]   There have been periods when things have been a little bit better and they have generally
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.940]   followed religious revivals.
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.100]   But if you read your secular history books, you will find that it's a history of what?
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.580]   Of wars, rumors of wars.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.180]   Kings, jealous and envious.
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.500]   Look at the fighting you've had here in Scotland.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.980]   It's been everywhere else throughout the world.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.980]   Life has been difficult.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:57.020]   There has been jealousy, envy, malice, spite, hatred, all the things that we are familiar
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.020]   with tonight.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:03.300]   But they've been here ever since the original fall of man.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:08.300]   Corruption, death, these are the terms which the apostle uses.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:14.980]   Well now, my friends, if you really are concerned about the present time, you've got to face
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.260]   it in a radical manner.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.900]   This is no time, you know, when the church is just here to tell people to exercise a
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.580]   bit of discipline and pull themselves together.
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:29.460]   It's a time when the church is to urge people to think and to know why things are as they
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.460]   are.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.500]   And here is the answer, the only explanation.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.900]   The world is in sin.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.580]   It is under the wrath of God.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:44.540]   This is what the apostle has been stating in the earlier passages of this mighty epistle.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:53.300]   And so we have an explanation, the only explanation of the sufferings of this present time.
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:59.420]   But thank God the Bible doesn't merely stop at diagnosis and at explanation.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.940]   It does start with that.
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.460]   And if you don't start with that, things will never be better.
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.980]   We've been told so often we are about to turn some magical turning.
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.980]   It's now North Sea oil.
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.540]   You'll find there'll be great problems after you've used all that.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:20.260]   No, no, the problem is man in sin, a rebel against God, and the wrath of God is upon
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:26.700]   all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.780]   Romans 1, 18.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.500]   But I say it doesn't stop at that.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.220]   Thank God for that.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.420]   It's God heard for us.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.700]   There's a message of salvation and of deliverance.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.700]   Did you notice the term?
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.700]   Listen to the apostle.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:48.180]   "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time"—and he doesn't minimize them, he doesn't
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.740]   try to explain them away, he doesn't say there's always a silver lining to every cloud.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.740]   Cheer up, we've rounded many a corner, we're a great old nation, we've rounded many a corner,
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.500]   we'll round this one somehow.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.340]   That's not Christianity.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.820]   That's philosophy, that's psychology, that's politics.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:10.140]   The only realistic message facing men tonight is the message of this Bible.
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:15.060]   Life is rare, life is earnest, and the grave is not its goal.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.060]   You notice the terms?
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:25.020]   "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.780]   glory which shall be revealed in us."
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.180]   What's he talking about?
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.180]   Glory.
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:36.940]   He talks about the creature being delivered from the bondage of corruption.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.180]   He says here that we ourselves are waiting for the adoption.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.180]   What is it?
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.820]   Well, a redemption.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.100]   Now this is the Christian message specifically.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:52.420]   Having brought us to see why we are what we are, it then gives us its wonderful solution.
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:56.820]   What is the Christian solution to the problems and the sufferings of this present time?
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.100]   Well, my friends, let's be realistic.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.740]   It's not world reform.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:08.940]   It's not Christian people entering into politics and social affairs.
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.740]   It's not a United Nations organization.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.700]   It's nothing that parliaments can do.
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.700]   No, no.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.700]   What is it?
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:21.020]   It's God's eternal plan of redemption.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:26.460]   That is literally the only hope facing us tonight.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:31.820]   The whole history of the human race has been the one that I've put before you.
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:36.780]   And in spite of periods of improvement, we always go back.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.780]   And the Bible says it's always going to be like this.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.140]   You remember the words of our blessed Lord.
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:49.180]   He said, "Even as it was in the days of Noah, even so shall it be in the days of the Son
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.420]   of Man."
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:55.440]   Christianity has never said that the world is going to get better and better.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:00.140]   The Church, when she's truly the Church, has never told people that if they become Christians
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.060]   all their problems are solved immediately and the world is automatically going on to
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.060]   perfection.
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.060]   Not at all.
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.060]   Our Lord put it like that.
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:13.580]   He said, "As it was in the days of Noah, even so shall it be in the days of the Son of Man."
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.940]   Well, what was it like in the days of Noah?
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.720]   What were they doing before the flood?
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:23.260]   They were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, buying and selling, planting
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.260]   and sowing.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.340]   What are they doing tonight?
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.340]   Isn't it exactly the same?
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.780]   Eating, drinking.
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.820]   Lord, do the same.
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.300]   What's the civilized life?
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:40.420]   Good food, good drink, good companionship.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.900]   Eating, drinking, marrying, giving in marriage.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.900]   Five or six marriages.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.060]   Yes, that's what they were doing before the flood.
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.860]   They're still doing it.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.900]   The world hasn't changed.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.180]   And they went on doing it until the flood came and took them all away.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.660]   It was the same, he says, before Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.420]   That's how it's going to be.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.940]   There shall be wars and rumors of wars.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:11.060]   Evil men shall wax worse and worse in spite of all kinds of education and culture.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.780]   They don't touch the evil heart of man.
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.020]   Why not face the facts?
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.380]   These are the facts.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:22.420]   The modern world is proving the truth of the biblical message.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.660]   But there is a hope, I say.
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.740]   Well, what is it?
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:28.860]   It is God's great plan of redemption and salvation.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.860]   What is that?
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:34.000]   Well, the apostle has been outlining it, as I say, in the first seven and a half chapters
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.580]   of this great epistle.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.860]   He says that death has passed upon the whole world because of the sin of Adam.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:45.740]   We are all born in Adam and we're all born to trouble as the sparks fly upwards in spite
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.740]   of everything.
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:49.980]   But God has got a plan of salvation, of redemption.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:50.980]   What is it?
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:55.300]   Well, in a strange way, he announced it even in the Garden of Eden.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.660]   You remember?
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:01.740]   He came down and having called them out and having pronounced his judgment upon them,
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:06.340]   he said, "I am going to set enmity between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.340]   woman.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:14.580]   But the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.580]   That's the only hope.
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.580]   God has said it.
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:24.660]   God is going to bruise that serpent, that evil, and he's going to destroy him.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:28.860]   And he's going to do it through the seed of the woman.
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:35.900]   And so in your Old Testament what you have is God preparing to put this great plan into
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:36.900]   operation.
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.780]   Read it, my friends.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.700]   Read of a man called Abram.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.940]   He was a pagan living in a place called Ur of the Chaldeas.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.260]   God called him out one day and said, "Come along.
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.740]   I want you to go to a country that you don't know.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:56.140]   I want you to come out to leave your family and everything else and to go where I'm going
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.140]   to lead you."
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:01.260]   And Abram went out not knowing whether he went.
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.260]   Why did he do it?
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.620]   Well, God had said to him, "Look here," he said, "I'm going to turn you into a nation.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.820]   And through you and your seed all the nations of the earth are going to be blessed."
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.700]   This is the hope.
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:15.500]   God forms a nation.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.700]   And through this nation he gives a knowledge of himself.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:23.100]   It was to them he gave the Ten Commandments, revealing his holy nature, revealing what
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:27.500]   man was meant to be, how man was meant to live, if he's to know peace and happiness
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.980]   and joy in this world.
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.700]   Isn't it time we went back to them?
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.940]   What's the matter with the world?
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:38.020]   This is the prescription, "Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.300]   commit adultery."
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.460]   How many centuries ago was that given?
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:44.460]   Out of date.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.460]   Out of date?
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.700]   It's the thing that's needed above everything in this country at this moment.
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.340]   The Ten Commandments and the moral law.
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.820]   That is how man is to live.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.340]   But this is a part of God's preparation.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:03.020]   And then you remember he instituted a great kind of religion and a religious ceremonial.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:07.460]   I find many Christian people, alas, who say they're not interested in the Old Testament,
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.460]   they're New Testament people.
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.780]   And they don't want to read, they tell me, the books of Leviticus and Numbers about burnt
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.780]   offerings and sacrifices and bulls being slain and the ashes of an heifer.
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.420]   What's it got to do with me, it says?
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:26.020]   What it has to do with you, my friend, is this, that God was giving pictures ahead of
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.380]   time of what he was going to do.
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:35.140]   These are the types of the great deliverer that is to come.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:41.620]   God was preparing this people to be the vehicle and the medium of his great salvation.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.540]   You get it in the book of Psalms.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.380]   You get it in the great books of the prophets.
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:51.100]   You remember Isaiah in his 40th chapter?
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:55.500]   "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God."
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.500]   Why?
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.020]   Well, a great deliverer is going to come.
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.700]   Make a way for him, he says, in the wilderness.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:06.060]   Take out the stones, make a straight path for him.
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:10.820]   Every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be brought low.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.380]   Make a way for him, the deliverer.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:19.900]   And every eye shall see him, God's plan, the great deliverer that is to come, the expected
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.180]   Messiah.
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:31.940]   And then, when the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman,
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.940]   made under the law, to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.660]   My dear friends, it's the only hope.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.460]   The birth of the babe of Bethlehem?
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.460]   What's this?
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.020]   The incarnation of the Son of God?
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.700]   It's the only hope for the world.
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.460]   No man can save the world.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.020]   No collection of men can save the world.
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:55.460]   Even a moral law such as that given through Moses can save a single soul.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:39:00.940]   Before man can be saved, the Son must come.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:06.260]   The Messiah, the deliverer, is none other than the eternal Son of God.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.700]   The babe of Bethlehem is the incarnate deity.
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.500]   You remember Isaac Watts celebrating it.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:17.700]   "Hail, in flesh, the Godhead see.
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:21.500]   Hail, incarnate deity."
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:28.180]   The only hope for the world tonight is this, that God so loved the world that he gave his
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:34.180]   only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.180]   life.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.660]   God is concerned about the world.
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.660]   Why?
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.500]   Because it's his world and not man's.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.660]   And he's not going to allow the devil to have the final victory.
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:49.460]   And he sent his Son into the world in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:54.540]   And he, the Son, came and he met all our problems and all our difficulties.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:59.120]   He conquered the devil who'd already defeated the first perfect man.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.500]   He conquered him every time he tempted him.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.060]   He mastered the elements.
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.240]   He healed sicknesses and diseases.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.740]   He could conquer even death.
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.540]   There was nothing he failed to do.
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.060]   He's the perfect deliverer.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:20.140]   But above everything else, and this is the most vital of all, it is in him we are reconciled
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.460]   to God.
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:28.220]   The sufferings are due to God's wrath upon us and to our sinfulness.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:34.620]   The first need of every human being is to be reconciled to God.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:37.780]   And there's only one way of reconciliation.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.780]   It is in Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:47.220]   He's the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.780]   Here is the promised deliverer and he's come.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:56.660]   And in this world he did everything that was necessary for your salvation and mine.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:59.540]   He bore our sins in his own body on the tree.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.860]   It cost him his life.
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.260]   He was buried in a grave.
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.380]   He burst us under the bands of death.
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.940]   He arose triumphantly.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:10.980]   He ascended into heaven and took his seat again at the right hand of God in the glory
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.980]   everlasting.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:16.740]   And there he sits and there he reigns.
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.220]   What is the message you see?
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.580]   What's all that to do with us?
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.460]   Well, here's the answer.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:33.000]   At this moment, with everything in the world as it is, you can be reconciled to God.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.180]   You can have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:46.420]   The old enmity that made Adam and Eve run behind the trees can be abolished and God
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.140]   will be your Father.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:58.300]   And he will become his Son, no longer in Adam but in Christ, born again, born of the Spirit,
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.300]   a Son of God.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:04.820]   Paul has been writing gloriously about it in chapters 5, 6, and 7.
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:13.020]   This amazing new birth, new nature, the old man dead, the new man alive and related to
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.020]   God.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:20.220]   Though still in this world, all this can be true of you.
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.100]   And you've got your problems, yes, but you can pray to God.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.380]   Did you notice?
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:28.540]   We know not what we should pray for as we ought, and we've often known that, haven't
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.540]   we?
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:34.980]   But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:39.980]   And Christ has said, "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:45.080]   And we know we can argue like this, that he spared not, we that spared not his own Son,
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.820]   but delivered him up for us all.
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.780]   How shall he not also with him freely give us all things?
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.820]   But we are in trouble, the sufferings.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:59.740]   "Yes," says this man, he quotes from the Old Testament, "for thy sake we are killed all
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:00.740]   the day long.
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.140]   We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:08.700]   Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that has loved us."
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:09.700]   How?
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.780]   "Well," I say, "here and now, with things exactly as they are at this moment.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.780]   You can know your sins forgiven.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:21.860]   You can know yourself reconciled to God, a child of God.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.140]   You will have a spirit within you which is new.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:28.620]   You will have a new power in your life that you have never known before.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.780]   But still," you say, "I am in this world of trouble.
[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.740]   I am in this world of suffering."
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:35.740]   Quite right.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:41.740]   Though you are a Christian, you are still in the world of trials and of sufferings.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:47.340]   To be a Christian does not mean that you enter into some Elysium or into some magical forest
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.220]   in which you never have any more troubles or problems.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.620]   Far too often some of our friends, the evangelists, have rather given that impression.
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.300]   Come to Christ and you will never know any more problems.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.260]   It is not true.
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:03.780]   The Christian is subject to all the sufferings in this sinful world.
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:10.660]   "Well," you say, "what is the point of Christianity then, if I still have to face all the same
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.660]   sufferings?"
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:17.140]   Listen, this is to me the most glorious thing in a sense in the whole of the Bible.
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.860]   I do not know how a man can live without this.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.540]   You know one of the greatest things the Christian faith does to a man?
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.740]   It gives him a new view of time.
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:35.740]   I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:41.060]   glory which shall be revealed in us.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:49.500]   The tragedy with the poor man of the world is that he only knows one kind of time, this
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.060]   present time.
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:55.100]   Poor fellow, it is the only time he knows.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.900]   There is not another for him.
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.660]   That is why he holds on to it.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.660]   He never talks about getting old and about old age.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.020]   He never talks about these things.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.580]   He says it is morbid.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:07.540]   He is holding on to this world and all he has got in it.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:08.540]   Why?
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:09.540]   Because he knows of nothing else.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:16.940]   The comfort and the consolation and the hope which the gospel gives to us is this, not
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:18.420]   this present time.
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.660]   Here we are going to get tribulations.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:26.180]   In the world we shall have tribulations.
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:30.100]   Christ never promised world reform, never.
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:38.540]   He said there would be troubles to the end, but the glory which shall be revealed in you.
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:39.540]   What is this?
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:46.940]   Well, it is the great biblical doctrine of the second coming of Christ.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.820]   The gospel does not end with Calvary.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.820]   It does not end with forgiveness, nor any of these matters.
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:56.540]   No, no, it is a world plan.
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.660]   It is a world redemption.
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.500]   The glory which shall be revealed in us.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.700]   What is he talking about?
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:08.020]   Well, the New Testament puts it like this, that there is a day coming, nobody knows when,
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:12.020]   when the Lord Jesus Christ is going to return to this world.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.620]   He has been in it.
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:20.980]   I reminded you he was crucified, buried, dead, raised, manifested himself for forty days,
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:25.540]   ascended in the sight of some of them, returned to the glory and took his seat at the right
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:26.540]   hand of God.
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:28.820]   And this is the message, my friends.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.900]   He is there at this moment.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:35.260]   He is sitting, he is reigning, all power has been delivered unto him.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.260]   What is he doing?
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:41.300]   He is waiting until his enemies shall be made his footstool.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.420]   He is coming again.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.420]   The work is not yet completed.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:52.380]   There is enough to save us, to make us sons of God, to give us a joy unspeakable and full
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.380]   of glory.
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:57.660]   Though we become unemployed, though we lose all our money, though we send back the television
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:03.620]   and everything else we've got under higher purchase, we can know a joy which passes description
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.700]   beyond all language.
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:13.460]   A joy unspeakable and full of glory, but we are still in this world.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.460]   Is that the end?
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.460]   No, no.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:20.420]   The glory is yet to be revealed.
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:28.700]   He will come again, not as the babe of Bethlehem this time, but as the King of kings and the
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.820]   Lord of lords.
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:36.300]   He will come riding the clouds of heaven, surrounded by the holy angels, and he'll
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.820]   come to judgment.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:43.100]   And he will judge the whole world in righteousness.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.060]   And what a glory it will be.
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:48.060]   Do you know what will happen, says Paul?
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:56.780]   You are going to share in that glory, the glory which shall be revealed in us.
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:57.780]   What is this?
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.900]   He puts it partly like this in the 23rd verse.
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:08.100]   He says the whole of creation is groaning and traveling, and not only they, but ourselves
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:13.060]   also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit.
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:17.060]   Even we ourselves groan within ourselves.
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.820]   Are you groaning, my friend?
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:24.500]   If you are not groaning because of the state of this world tonight, there's something very
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.860]   defective about your Christianity.
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.700]   The Son of God, when he was in this world, he groaned in it.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.340]   He wept in it.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.340]   Why?
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:37.180]   Because of sin and what it had done to God's perfect creation.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:42.660]   And says Paul, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting.
[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.740]   What are you waiting for?
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:45.740]   The adoption?
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:46.740]   What's that?
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:51.940]   The redemption of our body.
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.740]   My soul is already redeemed.
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.100]   My sins are forgiven.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.500]   I am a son of God.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:03.980]   More happy, but not more secure.
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.260]   The glorified Spirit's in him.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:15.260]   Yes, but my body, my old body, has this element of decay still in it.
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:22.380]   It's getting older, thirty-seven years, and it's got some scars in it that it hadn't got
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:25.220]   when I came in 1938.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:33.060]   It's a poor old body, and it's decaying, and it's dying, but there's a day coming when
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.980]   my very body is going to be redeemed.
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:39.500]   To wit, the redemption of your body.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:44.140]   You know the Apostle Paul, he attached great significance to this.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.420]   You often have heard this probably read at a funeral service.
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.740]   Have you realized what it means?
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:55.820]   Our conversation, he says, about Christians, our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:50:01.100]   From whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:07.220]   We are still citizens of Great Britain in a political sense, but our real citizenship
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.220]   is in heaven.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.620]   We are away from home.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:16.140]   We are colonists, as somebody translated it, and we are waiting for the appearing of our
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:17.140]   great Savior.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.140]   Why?
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:28.260]   Who shall change our vile body, the body of our humiliation, this poor old body.
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:34.900]   It's going to be changed, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, the body of his
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:42.060]   glorification, according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue even all things
[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.060]   unto himself.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:48.740]   When he comes, my very body will be glorified, and we shall meet him.
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:49.740]   We shall see him.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:50.860]   We shall be like him.
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:53.780]   We shall undergo this great change.
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.220]   We shall see him as he is.
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:51:00.020]   We shall be made like unto him, and we'll be glorified.
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:05.060]   But you know, says Paul, it doesn't stop even at that.
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.860]   Even the poor old creation is going to be redeemed.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:11.260]   Isn't this a marvelous message?
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:16.500]   I told you, didn't I, that because man was the Lord of creation, that when he fell, the
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:20.180]   whole of creation fell with him and under him.
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.180]   God doesn't forget.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:28.220]   God is not only going to redeem me as one of his sons, one of the lords of creation.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.820]   The whole creation is going to be delivered.
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:40.300]   Listen, the earnest expectation of the creature, the creation, waiteth for the manifestation
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.820]   of the sons of God.
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:44.320]   What imagination!
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.340]   What divine imagination!
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:50.540]   Paul looked out upon creation, and what he saw was this.
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:56.940]   He saw the whole of creation craning its neck, waiting for something.
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:58.500]   He said, what happens every spring?
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:04.060]   Oh, it's the old creation which has been cursed, craning out its neck, waiting for
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:06.780]   the manifestation of the sons of God.
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:07.780]   Why?
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:14.260]   Well, because when the lords of creation are restored, redeemed, and glorified, the whole
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:18.020]   of creation is going to be delivered also.
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:25.180]   We know that the whole creation groaneth and traveleth in pain together until now.
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:34.020]   But the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.820]   liberty of the children of God.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:41.940]   My dear friends, you and I have never seen the world that God made.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.780]   You live in a beautiful country.
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.940]   I am one of your greatest admirers in that respect.
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:52.580]   I think you have incomparable beauty up in your highlands, glorious.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:53:00.060]   You know, when we really see this glorified universe, we'll forget all about the highlands.
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:04.420]   It's nothing, not worthy to be compared.
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:10.300]   Nothing that you see is worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:11.300]   us.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:20.580]   Man totally redeemed, the whole cosmos redeemed to its original glory in its absolute perfection.
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:25.140]   God gave a preview of this to his servant the prophet Isaiah, and this is how he puts
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.140]   it.
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:31.500]   "There's a day coming when the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:37.260]   shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together,
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:42.500]   and a little child shall lead them, and the cow and the bear shall feed.
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:48.780]   Their young ones shall lie down together, and the lion and the ox shall eat straw, and
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:56.380]   the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and the sucking child shall play on the hole of
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:54:04.180]   the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's den.
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:09.700]   They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain."
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:10.700]   When?
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:14.980]   When Christians have entered into politics and the League of Nations or the United Nations
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:19.820]   is working and the politicians have produced perfect paradise again.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.100]   Oh, the tragedy of such talk.
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:24.540]   No, no.
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:29.100]   "They shall not hurt nor destroy in my holy mountain.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:38.540]   Then for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:43.900]   Oh, evil men are waxing worse and worse.
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:45.260]   Terrible things may be awaiting us.
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.260]   I don't know.
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:47.260]   Nobody knows.
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:53.860]   But it is more than likely that they will in view of our Lord's own prophecies.
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:57.260]   Terrible days may be awaiting us.
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:00.140]   Let them come.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:04.140]   Nothing can make God his purpose forego.
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:07.260]   Nothing can ever frustrate his plan.
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:11.220]   This is the plan of God.
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:15.300]   Everything seemed impossible before our Lord came the first time.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.940]   It was a time of terrible trouble.
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:23.060]   He came because God had planned it and determined it.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:32.820]   And equally certainly, in spite of the malice of men and of hell, he will come again, conquering
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:35.460]   and to conquer.
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:39.540]   And the redemption will be finally completed.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:45.980]   If God be for us, who can be against us?
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:50.900]   And then the apostle's final deduction.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.380]   What a logical man he was.
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:56:00.340]   Christianity's divine logic, not the sob stuff that certain people talk about.
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.340]   It's logic.
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.340]   I am persuaded.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.340]   What does that mean?
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.340]   I've got a feeling within me.
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:05.340]   No, no.
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.340]   I reason.
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:07.340]   I argue.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:11.760]   I have God's revelation.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.760]   He tells me what he's going to do.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:17.020]   I see what he's already done.
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:20.560]   And I know that he abides ever always the same.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:24.560]   And therefore, says Paul, I am persuaded.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:35.480]   I am certain that neither death nor life, economic collapse, confusion, revolution,
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:41.860]   anything you like to throw in, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:50.460]   present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:59.320]   to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.500]   That's the hope.
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:03.800]   It is the only hope.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.640]   Have you got it?
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.180]   What are you living on?
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:11.460]   I make no apology for being plain and erect and personal.
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:14.980]   Have you anything that you're living on at this moment?
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.420]   Have you any hope?
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:22.360]   This is the only hope.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:28.700]   And if you want to know it and to experience it, and its exhilarating joy, what do you
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.040]   do?
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.960]   You repent.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:38.600]   You confess that all your troubles and all the sufferings of this present hour are due
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:45.160]   to our sin and rebellion, inherited but repeated and confirmed by us individually.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:49.200]   It's all due to that, not our circumstances.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:55.440]   The faulty of Brutus is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.520]   You repent.
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.600]   You acknowledge it.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:58.640]   You confess it.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.680]   You cease to try to excuse yourself.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.760]   You ask God for mercy.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:08.960]   You cast yourself upon his compassion and his love.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:16.040]   And I can assure you that as you do so from the heart, you will know, he will tell you
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:23.600]   by his Spirit, that your sins and alienation have already been dealt with, that he's blotted
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:29.620]   them out as a thick cloud, having laid them upon his Son and having punished them in him.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:34.080]   And he will receive you and you'll have the Spirit of adoption.
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:37.640]   And you'll cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:46.560]   And you'll say, "If God be for me, who or what can be against me?"
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:56.780]   Believe the Gospel and you will begin to know the blessed, the only hope amidst the sufferings
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:59:02.600]   of this present time.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:06.520]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
