[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   If you didn't get a handout, they are spread around the room and I would encourage you
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   to get that.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.800]   It will help you as we move pretty quickly through the material.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.240]   The leadership in the family is a big topic and it required a lot of discipline on my
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.020]   part to keep it narrowed down.
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.480]   And Deuteronomy 6 is a very familiar passage.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.640]   If you have your Bible, turn to it, it's a familiar passage and it's a familial passage.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.880]   Family is all over it.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.840]   In that one chapter, there's nine references to sons or children, four references to the
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.240]   father, one to grandchildren and by reference to the grandparents, there's five references
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.700]   to the house or the home.
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.140]   Verse two addresses you and your son and your grandson and it speaks directly to what should
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.440]   be happening inside your home, in the privacy of your home, where you think it may not matter.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.200]   So for all of that, you might think tonight is about parenting or it's going to be about
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200]   marriage and it really isn't about either.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.120]   It's not directly about parenting, although there's a lot of that in Deuteronomy 6.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.320]   It's not about marriage, although there's a lot of application to marriage in Deuteronomy
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.200]   6.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.360]   This session is about your leadership.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.220]   Deuteronomy 6 describes the character and the role of the leader of the home in a consolidated
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.720]   way unlike really any other passage that I found.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.760]   As you well know by now, spiritual leadership is marked by knowing, living and teaching
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.760]   the Word of God and living an exemplary life.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:57.280]   Tonight, the focus is on what you say and how you live as you lead in your home.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.400]   If you're a husband, a father, a grandfather or you aspire to any of those, tonight is
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.920]   for you.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.540]   There will be undeniable and obvious application to marriage and to parenting and it actually
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.800]   may raise a lot of questions about that.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.760]   And I want to encourage you, I'm available afterwards as are your small group leaders
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.440]   to answer those questions and the Grace Church website has an abundance of content on all
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.880]   of that.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.720]   My discipline tonight is to talk to you men about you and about your leadership, about
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.620]   how you conduct yourself in your home and I'm going to start tonight with two stories.
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.800]   The first story is set in the late 1920s, Al Capone virtually owned and terrorized Chicago.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.660]   He was a vicious gangster and a mob boss.
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.480]   He was a cold-blooded killer.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.320]   His reign of terror was assisted by corrupt politicians, a public that loved him because
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.340]   he paid them to love him.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.900]   They were charmed and he had a partner and a friend named Eddie.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.300]   He was a lawyer, nicknamed Easy Eddie and Eddie was his lawyer for a very good reason.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.020]   He was very good and he was utterly corrupt.
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.740]   In fact, Easy Eddie's skill at legal maneuvering corruption and buying off juries was so pronounced
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.580]   that he kept Al Capone, Scarface, out of jail for anything other than what they finally
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.580]   got him for which was tax evasion.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.660]   To show his appreciation, Capone paid Eddie very well and as a result, Eddie and his family
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:55.060]   lived in a mansion that was fenced in, occupied an entire block of downtown Chicago.
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:02.140]   With all the luxury and safety and power that that wealth could bring him, Easy Eddie had
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.660]   a son that he loved dearly and despite his own deep involvement with organized crime,
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.820]   Eddie tried to isolate his son and his family from the life that he was living and he tried
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.500]   to teach his son right from wrong.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.820]   At some point, Eddie began to realize that there were two things he couldn't possibly
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.700]   give his son.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.580]   He couldn't give him a good name or a good example.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.980]   It's said that because of this, Eddie initiated contact with law enforcement and told the
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.220]   truth about his own crimes and the crimes of Al Capone.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.300]   His cooperation was his attempt to clean his tarnished image, his tarnished name and offer
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:55.120]   his son some evidence of repentance, making right all the things that he had done wrong.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.940]   He would have to testify against Al Capone and the mob and he knew it would cost a lot.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.660]   Al Capone was indeed convicted.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.960]   He went to prison and several years later and one week before Al Capone was released
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:17.980]   from prison, Easy Eddie was assassinated in broad daylight on a street in downtown Chicago.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.780]   He paid the price most expected he would pay.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.260]   Story number two.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.000]   World War II produced a number of heroes obviously and you probably know many of them.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.680]   One such man was a 28-year-old Lieutenant Commander Butch O'Hare.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   He was a fighter pilot assigned to the aircraft carrier Lexington in the South Pacific.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.020]   One day his entire squadron was sent on a mission.
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.840]   The ship was emptied of all airplanes to go on this mission and after O'Hare was airborne
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.540]   and in formation, he realized that his fuel tanks had not been topped off and consequently
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.720]   he didn't have enough fuel to accomplish the mission and get back to the ship.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:09.560]   The flight commander ordered him to drop out of the formation and return to the ship.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.640]   As he was returning to the Lexington, he saw a squadron of nine Japanese bombers heading
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.840]   for the aircraft carrier group.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:25.160]   Laying aside all thoughts of his personal safety and the commander's orders to return
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.480]   directly to the ship, he dove into that formation of Japanese bombers and he charged in with
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.720]   his .50 caliber wing mounted guns attacking one enemy plane and then another until he
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.420]   finally ran out of ammunition.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.400]   With no more ammunition, he began to dive at the other planes using his plane as a weapon
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.680]   trying to clip a wing or clip a tail to damage as many enemy planes as possible and render
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.140]   them unfit to fly.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.600]   Finally that Japanese squadron broke off the attack and turned towards home.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.160]   But O'Hare returned to the Lexington, managed to land the plane, his damaged fighter.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.680]   He related a few of the events surrounding the encounter, but he humbly left out most
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.160]   of the story.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:20.600]   However, the film from the gun camera mounted on his airplane told the tale.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.040]   He had in fact destroyed five enemy aircraft and he was credited with saving thousands
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.760]   of lives and the USS Lexington.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:38.880]   This took place on February 20, 1942 and for that action, Butch became the U.S. Navy's
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.700]   first ace of World War II and the first naval aviator to win the Congressional Medal of
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.700]   Honor.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:53.820]   A year later at 29 years of age, he led the first ever nighttime launch of fighter planes
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.980]   for an attack in World War II.
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.660]   He never returned.
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.860]   He was shot down and killed that night.
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:09.140]   And in Butch O'Hare's honor in 1949, Chicago's Orchard Depot Airport was renamed to this
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:15.840]   day, you know it as, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.880]   Years ago I was passing through O'Hare on a business trip and I saw a small display
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.800]   behind the security checkpoint at gate one.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.820]   A long layover and that little plaque on the wall and some curiosity led me down the
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:37.400]   trail of the story it told and the rest of the story it did not tell.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.060]   It didn't tell the whole story.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.620]   What do these two stories have to do with each other?
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.000]   Most people don't know and I certainly did not know that one of the busiest airports
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.760]   in the world is in Chicago and it's named after Butch O'Hare, the son of Easy Eddie.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:01.720]   Al Capone's best friend, his partner in crime, and his attorney, Butch O'Hare was Easy
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.700]   Eddie's son.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:10.440]   You all know the influence of a father or the lack of influence and relationship with
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   a father.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.400]   You all have a father.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:19.300]   Whether they're alive or not, you knew you have a father and my assumption is tonight
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.560]   that you are all fathers or you aspire to be a father.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:29.520]   I want to consider the opportunity you have as a father and as the leader of your home.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.240]   Your influence there is profound.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.000]   It is unmatched by any other influence you will ever have on this earth.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.160]   Your position as leader in the home is a God-given gift and all too often it's a blown opportunity.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.680]   I wonder if any of you think about how your leadership in your home is viewed by those
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:57.520]   whom you lead, your wife, your children, your grandchildren, or how your children and grandchildren
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:03.680]   will describe your leadership in the future, maybe even after you're gone.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.560]   For example, when your children start to have those conversations about you, about your
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:16.160]   leadership in the home, and they will, you will not be there to hear it or to fix the
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:23.000]   story or to make it sound better, to make it sound more friendly to you.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.760]   It will be well past your ability to change the story, whatever it is, it is, for better
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.880]   or worse.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:39.120]   Will that story be about a godly pattern or at least a trajectory that reflects the work
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.840]   of Christ in you?
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.480]   I mention trajectory because some of you have a terrible past to overcome.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:54.720]   Some of you might have a terrible current pattern to change and overcome.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.680]   Hopefully that change isn't as dramatic as E.Z.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.280]   Eddie's challenges.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.480]   Philippians 3.13 says this, and you should be encouraged by this, "Brothers, I do not
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.840]   consider myself as having laid hold of it yet, but one thing I do, forgetting what lies
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:21.120]   behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press towards the goal for the prize of
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.540]   the upward call of God in Christ Jesus."
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:31.980]   The grace and mercy in those verses should absolutely overwhelm you.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:38.400]   It should encourage you to examine yourself tonight and change course if needed.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.580]   E.Z. Eddie didn't live long enough to see the effect of the changes he made in his life
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:48.960]   and the change of the trajectory in his life and how that affected his son.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.800]   You might get to see that.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.120]   That matters.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:12:01.640]   The leadership of the man, the male, in the home was established in Genesis 2 and sadly
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:08.000]   illustrated through the failure and sin of Adam in Genesis 3.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.320]   The man is the leader at home regardless of whether you want to lead or you don't.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.160]   It's not optional.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.640]   You might be familiar with the Proverbs 31 woman.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.120]   Have you heard of the Proverbs 31 woman?
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:29.640]   It's a passage that famously describes the ideal woman.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.640]   It's the passage that says, "An excellent wife who can find for her worth is above all
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.600]   pearls," and it goes on from there.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.280]   Proverbs 31 is not a checklist of criticisms and shortcomings.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.800]   It is the aspiration of a woman and a reminder to men that we should be encouraging our wife
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.220]   and appreciating our wife and delineating those things that we should appreciate and
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.720]   encourage in our wife and our daughters.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.480]   Taking a similar approach to Deuteronomy 6 tonight, this is not a session to enumerate
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.560]   all of your failures and your weaknesses.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.040]   This is the ideal.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.760]   Nobody has this wired perfectly.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.200]   Man, you need to be encouraged by what you can be encouraged by tonight and we need to
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.120]   be reminded, encouraged, and even warned in the areas that need work for what we are going
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.480]   to look at tonight is normal.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.800]   It's expected.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.560]   It's what a leader in the home should look like.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.960]   Deuteronomy is a series of sermons and statements made by Moses at the age of 120.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:43.680]   It's understood that it was probably a couple of weeks before he went to heaven.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:49.020]   The focus and application tonight is the character of the man described in Deuteronomy 6 that
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:56.200]   leads the family from the inspired perspective of an old man at the end of his days on this
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   earth.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.080]   So let's jump in to Deuteronomy 6.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.800]   There's some things we're going to look at that I think flow right out of the passage.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.400]   Seven marks of a Deuteronomy 6 man or a man who is a leader in his home.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.480]   The first one is that he is a learner.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.340]   Deuteronomy 6 starts verse 1.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.480]   Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the judgments.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.000]   Those three phrases are used elsewhere.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:35.040]   For example, Psalm 19, 7 to 10 to describe the Bible, the word of God.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.080]   The commandment, the statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God has commanded me to
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.440]   teach you.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.380]   And we stop there.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.560]   When you see that there's a teacher, there's always a what?
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.280]   A learner.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.040]   And the Deuteronomy 6 man is a learner.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.840]   The first thing the preacher does is aim at you.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:04.160]   You must be committed to the lifelong pursuit of learning God's Word.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.840]   This is contrary to the popular view of manhood that says you already have all the answers
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.540]   at some point.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.960]   You don't.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.940]   That might be news to some of you.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.320]   Biblical manhood is a lifelong pursuit of learning God's Word and His wisdom and I'm
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.760]   comfortable saying that to you regardless of your age because the Bible says that.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.900]   In Proverbs chapter 1 verse 5, a wise man will hear an increase in learning until he
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:32.900]   gets married.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.000]   Is that what it says?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.640]   Or a wise man will hear an increase in learning until his children are finally out of the
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.000]   house.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.840]   There is no end to this.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.840]   None of that's there.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:52.240]   A wise man will hear an increase in learning and a man of understanding will acquire wise
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.240]   counsel.
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.240]   No age limit.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.640]   No expiration date.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.360]   The leader of the home is a learner.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.840]   Goes on in verse 7, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.140]   Fools despise wisdom and destruction.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:10.280]   So a wise man hears an increases in learning in verse 5 and verse 7 the contrast is with
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.760]   the fool who despises wisdom and instruction.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.040]   Don't be the fool.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.480]   Learn.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.520]   Learn God's Word.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:24.480]   It's good for the family to see the humility of the leader of the family learning the benefits
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:30.440]   of learning, the submission to the imperative that you must keep learning and it's also
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.600]   good for the family to see the results of that learning.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:42.120]   Sanctification, obedience and that's the second mark of a Deuteronomy 6 man.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.640]   He is obedient.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.360]   Keep reading here.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.020]   This is the commandment, the statutes, the judgments which the Lord your God has commanded
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.440]   me to teach you that you might do them in the land where you are going over to possess
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.720]   it.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.720]   Do them.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.520]   Obey.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.040]   Verse 2 goes on to say so that you, your son and your grandson might fear the Lord your
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:13.920]   God to keep all his statutes and his commandments which I commanded you all the days of your
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.960]   life.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:23.360]   Verse 17 in Deuteronomy 6, and I'm...excuse me, I am jumping around a lot tonight in Deuteronomy
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:30.200]   6, but verse 17, you should diligently keep the commandments of the Lord and His testimonies
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:37.880]   and His statutes which He has commanded you, those same three words.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:44.080]   Verse 18, "You shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord, obey."
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.400]   Verse 24, "So the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes, obey."
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:57.040]   Verse 25, "It will be righteousness for us if we are careful to observe all His commandments,
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.040]   obey."
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.560]   Do you see it?
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:08.120]   Over and over and over, the Deuteronomy 6 man is a learner so that he can obey.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.040]   It's not just a gathering of head knowledge, your obedience to the Bible is before the
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:19.320]   Lord and as an example to your wife and your children and your grandchildren.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:24.000]   The theme of obedience is repeated over and over and over in Deuteronomy.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.720]   There's a connection, thank you.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:31.200]   There's a connection between knowing God's Word, obeying God's Word, and the blessings
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.560]   that come from God when you do that.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.240]   The leader of the family knows it.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.120]   He lives this.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.000]   He leads his family under this simple yet profound connection.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.220]   You learn, you obey, and the Lord blesses you.
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:58.200]   You want your family to learn to obey and to be blessed by God, and you must lead by
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   example.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.200]   That's leadership.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.480]   That's spiritual leadership.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:08.000]   The influence of your leadership is drawn from the example of your own obedience.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.960]   Without that, what you say to your family, particularly your children, when you're directing
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:22.840]   their behavior to the extent it conflicts with how you live, it becomes optional, confusing,
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.880]   and it presents a false choice.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:34.000]   That false choice is, "Should I follow my father's words or how he lives his life?"
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.320]   The leader of the family is obedient and his stated and lived motivation in life is to
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:49.320]   be obedient, and he understands that hypocrisy is deadly to effective leadership in the home.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:56.080]   Which leads us to our third point, that obedience is motivated by the fear of God.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.600]   The Deuteronomy 6 man fears God.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.800]   Why do you learn?
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   So that you obey.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.440]   Why do you obey?
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   Because you fear God.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:12.580]   It says that right there in verse 2, "So that you and your son, excuse me, that you and
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.660]   your son and your grandson might fear the Lord your God."
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:22.380]   Verse 13, "You shall fear only the Lord your God."
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:31.800]   Verse 24, "So the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes to fear the Lord our God."
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.900]   The fear of God always leads to obedience and obedience always leads to the fear of
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.900]   God.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:42.600]   There's a repeated correlation in Scripture and here in Deuteronomy between the fear of
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:49.840]   God, obedience, wisdom, and blessing.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:56.440]   Nowhere is the connection between the fear of God and the blessings from God more immediately
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:03.400]   evident than in the confines of your home and the family.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:10.000]   Deuteronomy establishes it, Proverbs is full of it, Ecclesiastes talks about it, it'll
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.360]   sound familiar here in a minute, and there's one Psalm that highlights it so clearly and
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:21.200]   that's Psalm 128, verses 1 through 4.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.960]   Let me look first at verses 2 and 3 and see if this isn't how you want your family described.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:33.240]   Verses 2 and 3, "When you shall eat of the fruit of your hands, you will be happy and
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.200]   it will be well with you."
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.100]   Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.480]   Sounds like Ecclesiastes.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.520]   This is talking about the provision of the Lord through the provision of your hard work.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.560]   The beneficiary of your hard work is your home.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:55.200]   The picture here you'll see is as the family sits around the table and shares a meal, there
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.040]   is happiness and contentment from the provision of the Lord.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.240]   There's happiness and then it goes on to talk about who's around that table.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.720]   Verse 3, "Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine within your house," and this speaks to
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.640]   the bearing of children and her role in raising those children.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:19.400]   And then it speaks of the children, "Your children like olive plants around the table,"
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:25.520]   speaking of thriving and successful children who will themselves someday bear fruit.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.480]   You see the picture?
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.280]   That's the picture.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.880]   The parentheses around that picture is what I want you to see.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.720]   How do you get there?
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.600]   How can I have that?
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   It's what we think.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:43.000]   Verse 1, "How blessed or happy is everyone who," what?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.760]   "Fears the Lord, who walks in His ways," fear of God, obedience.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.040]   Fear of God, obedience.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.040]   And then that great description of the home and then verse 4, the bookend on the other
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.800]   side, "Behold, for thus shall the man be blessed," who, what?
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.680]   Fears the Lord.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:11.920]   The leader of the home is a learner, he's obedient and he fears the Lord and the fear
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:17.560]   of God in this context is really synonymous with the word love, the love of God.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:23.200]   Verse 5, Deuteronomy 6 verse 5, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.640]   with all your soul, and with all your might."
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.360]   The word heart speaks of the inner part, the midst.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:38.040]   Soul speaks of the seat of your appetites, the seat of your emotions, your passions,
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.160]   the will.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.960]   With all your might speaks of loving to abundance, with force, exceedingly, and I love this,
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.640]   with muchness.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.960]   Love God to abundance, with force, with muchness.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:02.520]   Let the love of God inform your conscience, govern your appetites, control your emotions
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:07.900]   and passions and drive you to know Him more so that you can obey Him better for the benefit
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.840]   of your family and for the glory of God.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.200]   That's leadership in the home.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.200]   The leader in the home is driven to obedience out of love for God, not because he's afraid
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:29.720]   of God and he's motivated to show his children and grandchildren the way by his example.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:35.540]   Number 4, the Deuteronomy 6 man is steadfast.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:42.560]   Back in verse 2 of Deuteronomy 6, "So that you and your son and your grandson might fear
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.560]   the Lord your God to keep all his statutes, his commandments, which I command you."
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:55.600]   And here's the phrase, "All the days of your life and that your days may be prolonged."
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.280]   All the days of your life consumed with the task, purposeful, lifelong.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.880]   The leader of the home understands and embraces the long game.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:14.520]   When it says you, your son, and your grandson, that is the full spectrum of your life and
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.800]   my life.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.400]   It's all included.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.320]   This is the range of a man's existence, all the days of his life.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:28.720]   The Bible talks a lot about a man who is constant, who is steadfast, unwavering, holding fast.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:35.160]   You're familiar with 1 Corinthians 15, 58, "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast,
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.920]   immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.520]   vain in the Lord."
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:46.940]   This is completely consistent and expands the concept that Moses references when he
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:52.440]   says all the days of your life.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:58.320]   The Deuteronomy 6 man believes this is true and his convictions are constant, never changing,
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:03.160]   deeply held, constantly fed and nurtured by the learning of the Word of God throughout
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.560]   his life.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.000]   The lesson for your home is, man, don't be careless.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.440]   Don't get careless.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.600]   Don't start thinking that you've arrived and that the battle is over.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.560]   It isn't.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.640]   We're called to be steadfast from beginning to end.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:28.840]   Verse 3 of Deuteronomy 6 says, "Oh, Israel, you should listen and be careful to do it."
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:35.200]   The admonition to you and I is in our leadership at home, we need to be very steadfast and
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.040]   in that, be very careful.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:45.200]   Ephesians 5, 15, "Therefore, be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise,
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.080]   making the most of your time because the days are evil."
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.920]   Watch how you walk in your home.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.200]   All the way to the finish line.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.280]   Your family is watching.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:04.080]   What you say, how you live, your character, everything is being recorded in those little
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:10.520]   brains or I should say in the brains of those little people we call children and grandchildren.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.240]   Their brains are probably better than ours.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.920]   You know, I reflected in thinking about all of this, I don't remember much of anything
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:22.360]   my father taught me when I was young.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:27.600]   I do remember some of what he taught me in my teen years and in my 20s.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:37.360]   What I remember vividly in so much detail is my father in his 70s and his 80s and particularly
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.320]   in the last months as he was dying.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.120]   Go all the way to the finish line, men.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:48.200]   May your leadership and your family legacy be steadfast, immovable as you abound in the
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:55.760]   work of the Lord as the leader of your home all the way to the end.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.840]   Number five, the Deuteronomy 6 man guards his heart.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:07.560]   Verse five of Deuteronomy 6 says, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.440]   with all your soul, with all your might.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.560]   These words which I'm commanding you today shall be on your heart."
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.960]   And talking to men about their heart might sound very unmanly.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:23.640]   This is exactly the opposite.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:29.480]   In Deuteronomy, the family man knows the importance of his heart and guarding his heart, of what
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.680]   he puts in his heart.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.800]   That little phrase "shall be on your heart" is loaded with meaning and practical implication
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.920]   which time limits us to explore.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:50.120]   But the Bible correlates what is on your heart with the quality of your life, many, many
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   times.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:56.400]   And what I've put on the screen is just a few, a quick overview of the benefits of the
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:01.760]   commandments, judgments and statutes of the Lord being on your heart.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:10.520]   Psalm 37, 31, it implies that if you don't want your step to slip, the law of God needs
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.400]   to be on your heart.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:20.000]   Psalm 40, if you want to do God's will, then your law should be on your heart, on your
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   heart.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.520]   Psalm 119, how many of us don't want to sin, we want to obey?
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:35.200]   Well, it says in verse 11 that that happens when his word is treasured in our hearts.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.520]   Jeremiah 31, "I will put my law within them and on their heart I will write it."
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.760]   And look what happens, "And I will be their God and they shall be my people."
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:55.120]   A Deuteronomy 6 man blocks out all other affections and preoccupations of the heart other than
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.680]   love for Christ, love for his word and love for that which the Lord loves, which happens
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:08.880]   to be your family, your wife, your children, your grandchildren.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:19.440]   And that love and that preservation and guarding of your heart informs what you say.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:26.760]   And that takes us to our next point, which is that the Deuteronomy 6 man is a teacher.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.760]   He's a teacher.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.440]   The leader of a home is a teacher.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.720]   Verse 7 of Deuteronomy 6, "You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:41.440]   of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.040]   and when you rise up.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.720]   You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:52.360]   You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates."
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:57.760]   There's a whole bunch of parenting implication here.
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:05.800]   But remember, I'm talking about you, the character of the man who leads the home.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:13.600]   Verse 1 starts with, "I'm going to teach you," and then right here in verse 7, "You teach
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   them."
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.560]   Now, does that pattern sound familiar?
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.880]   Second Timothy 2.2, "The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:29.680]   witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also."
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:34.120]   Moses is making the point that I'm going to teach you.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:40.040]   It's your job to raise faithful children and to teach them so that they will teach others
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:46.080]   also.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.840]   A man doesn't get to say, "I'm not a teacher."
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:55.320]   Credible implications for you and I, and it's incredible implications if you're raising
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.020]   sons.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.320]   You're not just raising a son, you're raising a man.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:04.400]   You're raising a man who will lead a home someday that needs to be equipped and know
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.800]   how to teach.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:15.560]   And Moses is so helpful in this passage because he addresses two questions that he knows,
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:20.640]   and he was right, that your family is going to ask you.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:25.320]   Two questions that you want your family to ask you.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.680]   Two profound questions.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:34.600]   What does the Bible mean, and why should I obey God?
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:43.160]   Well, down in verse 20, Moses literally scripts out the answers to these two questions.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.560]   It's incredible, isn't it?
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:49.320]   Verse 20, "When your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What do the provisions and
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.040]   the statutes and the judgments,' you know by now the provisions, the statutes and the
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.920]   judgments is referencing," what?
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.000]   The Word of God.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.240]   So when your son asks you, "What does the Bible mean," which the Lord our God commanded
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:10.200]   you, verse 21, "Then you shall say to your son," and before we go through that, I want
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:16.800]   to kind of pull over and think a minute about that phrase, "When your son asks you."
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:20.640]   This is talking about children.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:30.920]   Man, when your children ask you a question, you need to know that that's why you're there.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.820]   That's what you want.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.720]   Questions are a window into the soul and the character of your children, and in fact, you
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.240]   might want to wait sometimes for a question.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:49.920]   Too often we force feed our opinions and perspectives and even truth to an unreceptive little human
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:57.760]   being, a good and effective teacher, a leader of his home sometimes waits for the question.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:03.320]   There is almost a promise here, they will ask you this question.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:10.360]   If you're learning, you're obeying, you're fearing God, all of this is going on in front
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:17.240]   of them, they will ask you and you need to be prepared with the answers.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.200]   And you want your answers to be heard and followed, don't you?
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.880]   It's your responsibility to ensure that when you answer these questions, what you say is
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:34.600]   believable, it's authoritative, and it's compelling.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.440]   That's spiritual leadership.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.520]   And if you're known as a learner yourself, as an obedient man, as a man who fears the
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:50.680]   Lord, you're steadfast in your biblical conviction, it makes your words unavoidable.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:56.940]   And by the way, they still may be rejected ultimately, but that is a result you're not
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.000]   accountable for.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.800]   You are accountable for making sure that you preserve the viability and reliability of
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:11.680]   what you say through sound words and a life of integrity.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.840]   Too many men think that by virtue of rank or title of husband or father, head of my
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:23.120]   home, that your family will listen, they'll hear it, and they will act.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.040]   This is not the case.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.120]   And all God's men probably said what?
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.120]   Amen.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.060]   It doesn't always work out this way.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:36.080]   If it always worked out that way, leadership in the family would be easy.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:43.280]   By God's design, you must compel the efficacy of truth by the vindication of your own consistent
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.640]   behavior.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.280]   That ultimately is what might defeat the competing influences in your children's lives, which
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:57.340]   may be friends, it may be social media, it may be teachers, professors, and mostly their
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.880]   own sinful hearts.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.880]   We must teach.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.540]   We must be ready for the questions.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:10.780]   We must be ready at minimum to these two questions.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:16.920]   So when your children ask, and you must and should pray that they do, you want to know
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.120]   how to pray for your children?
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.880]   Pray that they ask these questions.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.620]   Pray that you're prepared to answer the questions.
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.040]   So what does the Bible mean?
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.800]   Verse 21, here it is.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:36.180]   And you shall say to your son, "We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and the Lord brought
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.620]   us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:43.340]   Moreover, the Lord provided great and terrible signs and wonders before our eyes against
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.380]   Egypt, Pharaoh, and all his household.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:50.680]   He brought us out of there in order to bring us in, to give us the land which he had sworn
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.600]   to our fathers."
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.340]   What in the world does that have to do with the question, what does the Bible mean?
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.060]   This is incredibly profound.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.960]   There's so much to say here, very limited time.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:08.560]   Let me give you a couple of general principles, and there's four, or there's three, but don't
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.560]   worry about it.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.560]   Don't number them.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.740]   I'm just gonna rip through this.
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:16.420]   What he scripts out is biblical history.
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.880]   Let me boil it down.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:23.480]   Tell your children who God is and what he's done.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.720]   That is what the Bible is there for.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.600]   That is the message of the Bible.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.320]   Why do we have a Bible?
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.480]   To know God.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.640]   What does it mean?
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:40.000]   All understanding of the Bible flows through an understanding of the character of God himself.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Last year, Brad went through, in Men of the Word, the attributes of God.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.600]   If you're a young dad, I would commend that series to you to listen to it over and over
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.600]   and over.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:57.720]   And if your children are old enough, get them to listen to it with you.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.760]   That wasn't random.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.880]   It wasn't coincidental.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:06.000]   Brad was informing your leadership, and here it is in Deuteronomy.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.960]   When you're asked, what does the Bible mean, it is all run through the filter of who God
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.760]   is and what he's done.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.200]   The answer to this most basic question is found in the character and acts of a mighty
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.400]   God.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:25.420]   The Bible tells us who he is.
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:30.040]   And then the question, why should I obey?
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:35.900]   I won't have asked for a show of hands, but I'm going to bet most of you have had children
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.000]   who have asked you that question.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.160]   Why should I obey?
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.000]   And by the way, your goal as a parent is not to teach them to obey you.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.120]   I hope you understand that.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:55.240]   The requirement that they obey you is to teach them the concept and the relationship so that
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:01.880]   when they leave your home, they understand how to obey who, God.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.200]   Why should I obey?
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.240]   And Moses here lays out four reasons starting in verse 24.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.200]   And again, I'm going to go through this pretty quick.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.680]   Verse 24, first answer is because God said to.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.620]   It's that simple.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:22.180]   Verse 24, so the Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes.
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:28.860]   Moses is answering the question when your children ask you, and anyone else by the way,
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.860]   why should I obey?
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.860]   Verse 24, the first reason is because God told us to.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:38.900]   The second is it's for our good.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.460]   It's for your good.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:46.700]   The Lord commanded us to observe all these statutes in verse 24, to fear the Lord our
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:50.960]   God for our good always.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.740]   And then number three, for our survival.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.900]   You want your children to survive?
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:01.300]   Teach them to obey God.
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.860]   When they want to know why, that's why.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:06.220]   And then number four is for the glory of God.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:11.600]   This passage goes on verse 25 to say, it will be righteousness for us if we are careful
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:16.900]   to observe all this commandment before the Lord our God, just as he commanded us.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:24.100]   Ephesians 2.10 says, we were created in Christ Jesus for good works, which he prepared beforehand
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:28.020]   that we would walk in them.
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:34.340]   When you obey God as a believer, you are doing what he ordained before you even knew what
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.420]   you were doing.
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.260]   And it glorifies God.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.860]   That is what that is saying in Deuteronomy 6.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.460]   It will be righteousness for us.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:47.980]   Christ's righteousness placed on us.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.700]   And why do we obey?
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.460]   Because we want to glorify God.
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:58.660]   A family leader teaches with his words and his life, in all phases of life, and in all
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:04.500]   your teaching, you must address the character of God, the word of God, the commands of God,
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:08.540]   and the grace and the blessings of God.
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:15.060]   And this surely leads to our last point, number seven, that the Deuteronomy 6 man worships
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:18.660]   God.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:26.180]   And in Deuteronomy 6.10-15 describes the worship of the leader in the home.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:33.420]   And the context is the home and the entire chapter culminates in really in these verses.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.860]   Verse 13 is the center and the core of all of it.
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:41.140]   Verse 13, "You shall fear only the Lord your God and you shall worship him and swear by
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:45.460]   his name."
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:49.980]   And the worship of the leader in the home is driven by four elements.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:55.980]   And I tried to make it somewhat evident with a highlighter for you in the overhead.
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:01.340]   But there's four things that animate the worship of the leader in the home as he leads his
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:08.580]   family in worship, teaches his family to worship, and its humility, its remembering, its love,
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.980]   and it is exclusivity.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.980]   What does that mean?
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.580]   Well, it's right there in verse 10, the humility.
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:20.640]   Verse 10, "Then it shall come about when the Lord your God brings you into the land which
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:27.780]   he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you great and splendid
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:32.820]   cities which you did not build and houses full of all good things which you did not
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:39.420]   fill, and hewn cisterns which you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees."
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:44.980]   You see the same picture as Psalm 128 there, "Vineyards and olive trees which you did not
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.860]   plant and you eat and you're satisfied."
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:56.820]   There is a humility in those statements that parallels 1 Corinthians 4, 7.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:01.780]   "For who regards you as superior?
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.140]   What do you have that you did not receive?
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:10.500]   And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?"
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.060]   You've been given everything.
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:17.900]   And the humility of that recognition drives worship.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:26.500]   It goes on in verse 12, talking about remembering, "Remember, watch yourself," it says in verse
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:32.300]   12, "that you do not forget the Lord who brought you from the land of Egypt out of the house
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.380]   of slavery."
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:40.220]   Do you see the merging here of what you teach your children with the resulting worship?
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:48.060]   Third, verse 13, "You shall fear only the Lord your God."
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.300]   This is the love for God.
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:53.860]   That's what animates, that's what drives our worship.
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:44:01.780]   Humility, remembering what the Lord has done and who He is, loving Him for all of that,
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.260]   and then fourth, exclusivity.
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:10.660]   Verse 14, "You shall not follow other gods, any of the gods of the people who surround
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.660]   you."
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:20.420]   If you're a parent of young children, I know this hits straight on target, or it should.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:25.620]   The gods around us are more prevalent and visible and available today than they've ever
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.620]   been.
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:31.620]   We want to lead our children in the worship and explain and make them understand by our
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:37.260]   example and our teaching that you shall not follow other gods, any of the gods of the
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:43.180]   people who surround us, for the Lord your God in the midst of you is a jealous God.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:51.620]   Otherwise, the anger of the Lord your God will be kindled against you and He will wipe
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:54.660]   you off the face of the earth.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:45:00.300]   It's a great way to end the night.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.820]   Some of you might say, "Really, we're going to leave it with being wiped off the face
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.820]   of the earth?"
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:12.820]   Yeah, it's a great way to end because if you're a believer, we love that jealous and
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:20.860]   angry God, and by His work on the cross and our faith in Jesus Christ alone for His redemption,
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:25.420]   we have nothing to fear by that last phrase.
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:32.820]   We worship God because of His justice, and we look forward to that justice.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.820]   But if you do not know Christ and have not repented of your sins, you do have everything
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:41.020]   to fear.
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:47.180]   There's no need to leave tonight, though, afraid.
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:52.180]   Romans 10, 9 says that if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:58.500]   your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be what?
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.180]   Saved.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:06.840]   For with the heart a person believes, resulting in obedience or righteousness, and with the
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.620]   mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:17.620]   For the Scripture says, "Whoever believes in Him will not be disappointed."
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:23.860]   If you read verse 15 and you're afraid, I want you to seriously consider tonight you
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.160]   do not need to leave here afraid.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.140]   We want to talk to you.
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:34.180]   If you love the Lord, you've repented of your sins, we exult in all of verses 10 through
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:38.060]   15, every word of it, we love that God.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.580]   We worship that God.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:45.220]   And men, you cannot possibly follow the example of the Deuteronomy 6 man in your own home
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:50.420]   unless you have the Holy Spirit, unless you have confessed with your mouth, "Jesus is
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:58.340]   Lord," and believed in your heart that He's raised from the dead, and you're saved.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.060]   Let me close in prayer.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:07.780]   Lord, we end on a serious note because Moses took us there.
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.180]   Lord, we are a needy people.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.540]   We serve a great God.
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:16.100]   We're so grateful to you for who you are and what you've done.
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:23.140]   Lord, I pray that you enable the men in this room who know and love you to be learners,
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:29.500]   to be obedient, to love you above all else, to be steadfast in conviction, to guard their
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:39.140]   hearts, and as a result of all of that, to teach their children, to lead their families,
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:47.700]   and then to worship before our families, before you, and to raise up from our home worshipers.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.900]   Lord, thank you for Moses.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.060]   Thank you for your word.
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.580]   Thank you for this passage.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:59.460]   Lord, I pray that as we go to the group discussions now, that you would superintend that conversation.
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:06.260]   Lord, I do pray for those who are here tonight who may not have the confidence of not being
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.260]   afraid of you.
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:13.140]   Lord, may they not go home until they resolve that and are reconciled to you.
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.500]   We pray this in Christ's name, amen.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:25.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
