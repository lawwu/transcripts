[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   - We actually talk a lot about travel on the show.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.200]   I'm imagining you've been to,
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.320]   I don't know, countless countries.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.520]   I don't know if you even keep track.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.160]   Is there a favorite?
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.880]   Is there, are there places that you love going
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.720]   and going back to that, you know,
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.200]   aside from just the skating there
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.040]   might inspire people listening to?
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.400]   - Iceland is amazing because
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.400]   the landscape is so diverse.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.640]   I can't explain it, but you, like, you go there,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.000]   as soon as you leave the airport,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.360]   it looks like you're on the moon.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.800]   And there's just all of these,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.980]   all of this moss covering these rocks,
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.040]   and there's the Blue Lagoon.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.280]   And, and then as you drive South,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.640]   it completely changes into like,
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.520]   almost like a farm setting.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.920]   And then, and then it changes again,
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.760]   like another half hour into the drive.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.680]   And, and yeah, I mean, it can get really cold there,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.000]   but it's really, it's an amazing place.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.440]   And so my wife and I went there a long time ago,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.920]   almost, almost 15 years ago now,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.160]   and it felt very untapped.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.240]   Definitely wasn't a tourist destination.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.800]   And now it feels much more like there is tourism,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.920]   but if you just drive out of the city,
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.760]   you can see some amazing sights.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.600]   - My general rule is if you go,
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.200]   not when everyone else goes and leave a little bit outside,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.520]   you can have a very different experience.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.080]   - Yeah, we're not afraid to,
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.200]   to go way off the beaten path, which we do a lot.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.240]   Other than that, Japan is just so, so surreal.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.600]   It feels like a video game.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.280]   - We just did an episode on Japan,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.160]   and the episode was like three,
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.160]   we were like three hours in
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.240]   and we covered Tokyo and Kyoto, like with, and Japan.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.080]   - Oh yeah.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.560]   - We couldn't even get kind of close
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.400]   to comprehending the entire country.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.160]   And the guy I was talking to had been there 20 times
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.400]   or something, and like, he's just still like every,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.160]   everywhere I go, I see something new.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.120]   - Oh, every time.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.040]   And we brought our kids when they were all,
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.520]   I brought all of them when they were pretty young,
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.880]   but we brought them all when they were, you know,
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.240]   just before they were teenagers
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.640]   and they were all mesmerized.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.640]   Like it was fascinating.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.120]   Even the, even Disneyland is, you know,
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.800]   it's still the magic kingdom, but it's very different.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.680]   - Japan's one of the coolest places.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.640]   Early on, you traveled a lot as a skater
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.000]   before you'd hit the kind of success you've had now.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.120]   I got to ask a question I know everyone is thinking
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.360]   because multiple people said I should ask,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.880]   were you racking up all these miles?
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.800]   'Cause I know you weren't making a lot in the early days,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.440]   especially in that kind of mid part of your career.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.360]   What was that like?
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.600]   You know, you were tall, you started getting tall,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.920]   uncomfortable, were using points,
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.680]   were you trying to get status and upgrades?
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.560]   - I honestly, I didn't fly first class
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.840]   until I was in my thirties.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.120]   - Were you optimizing things when you traveled thinking,
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.120]   okay, I'm gonna rack up a bunch of miles.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.240]   - Yeah, but also just,
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.680]   I just learned how to travel more efficiently
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.360]   and a little bit lighter
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.200]   and how to navigate airports and lines
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.280]   and, you know, where the best security checkpoint is
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.840]   instead of the one where everyone's just being fed into,
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.560]   just stuff like that.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.440]   I guess I learned how to be a better traveler in those days,
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.760]   but I learned the value of frequent flyer miles
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.240]   through those years.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.240]   Especially when I wasn't making very much money,
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.720]   but I did still have to travel to go do stuff,
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.960]   I collected a lot of miles.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.440]   Yeah, I mean, I was a million miler on United very early on.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.800]   - You know what they sent me for that?
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.960]   Luggage tax.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.880]   - That was gonna be my guess.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.240]   Like it's not a very rewarding experience.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.080]   Here you go.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.920]   10 bucks.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.840]   What would some of the things
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.960]   if you were telling your favorite travel hacks
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.160]   to how you make your life efficient when you travel,
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.120]   whether it's, you know, a secret neck pillow
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.560]   or some crazy, you know, eye mask?
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.400]   - Well, let's see.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.240]   I just flew home from New York and it was last minute.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.760]   And so I'm in the bulkhead.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.760]   I do like, I don't know, it's not some great hack,
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.520]   but if you want to travel with your laptop or anything else,
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.840]   'cause you know, you have to put your backpack
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.040]   up in the overhead.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.000]   We're getting into the weeds here,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.960]   but if you're in the bulkhead,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.880]   take your laptop out and put it right under your feet
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.280]   so that half of it's kind of under your own seat.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.200]   And then the other half,
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.960]   you just kind of lightly put your heels on it.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.360]   It'll hide it from the flight attendants.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.280]   And then you have your laptop.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.080]   You don't have to go up and get it,
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.120]   which is like kind of a hassle, right?
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.360]   - Yeah, if you have one of those laptop sleeves,
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.480]   I like to get like a black one
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.080]   'cause then it just blends in everywhere.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.040]   - Yeah, I'm pretty good at just hiding it all together.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.200]   And then usually, like, I'll have a little bag.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.280]   It's usually actually my toiletry kit.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.200]   And then I just stuff like my headphones
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.680]   and my iPhone cable, you know.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.640]   - Everything you need.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.000]   - Everything I need, but just put that
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.080]   and then put that on the side of the seat
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.000]   so they don't see that either.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.760]   That's my bulkhead hack for you.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.800]   - Love it, yeah.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   - But as far as other travel,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.000]   I think I learned also just to, you know,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.640]   it's not like I carry some big wardrobe or anything,
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.640]   but I do try to keep it down to a carry-on and a backpack.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.600]   If I can, at all costs,
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.880]   'cause I don't want to check bags.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.360]   I can't, I'll tell you that the biggest travel hacks
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.800]   for skateboards and, you know,
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.240]   people will travel with skateboards,
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.880]   but you can travel with a skateboard
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.520]   and put it in the overhead anywhere in the U.S.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.680]   If you're making a connection,
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.680]   say in Frankfurt or London or even Tokyo,
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.880]   you, is it Tokyo?
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.160]   You can't carry your skateboard on the plane
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.280]   through those airports.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.360]   So I have been told,
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.080]   I've been told a couple of times,
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.200]   I've actually gotten away with it once,
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.480]   but, and I learned the hard way,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.320]   like going through London,
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.520]   you're in the terminal, you're connecting, right?
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.680]   But you know how they have to,
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.800]   you have to go through another security checkpoint?
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.840]   You can't bring your skateboard.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.160]   So you have to go outside the airport
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.320]   on a connecting flight and check it in.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.320]   - And probably miss your flight, maybe.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.160]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.240]   And I've actually thrown a skateboard away because of that.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.080]   - Yeah.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.480]   - In London, they said, "Oh, you got to check in."
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.720]   I go, "I don't have time."
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.080]   They go, "Well, I don't know what to tell you."
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.520]   And then I put it in the trash can
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.280]   at the security checkpoint.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.600]   Okay.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.440]   I'm done.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.280]   - Do you think it's a safety risk?
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.360]   Do they think it's a weapon or?
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.200]   Like what is it?
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.040]   - I assume, yeah.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.280]   I mean, also Mexico too, surprisingly,
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.480]   you can't carry a skateboard on the airplane in Mexico.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.600]   So every time we travel with the kids to Mexico,
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.000]   we've got to put them all in plastic bags.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.680]   So we're just this, we're a disaster coming back
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.480]   'cause we're just a bunch of luggage.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.840]   So yeah, that's my advice.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.320]   I don't know if it's a hack, it's just my advice.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.600]   Like if you're going to travel through Europe,
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.960]   don't carry your skateboard onto the plane
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.160]   that is connecting.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.960]   - That could probably apply to other items.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.400]   There are some, I can't remember,
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.680]   not that it's the end of the world
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.400]   to replace things like nail scissors,
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.880]   but there's some nail clippers.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.800]   There's some country where you can't bring nail clippers
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.760]   on your plane, 'cause I remember,
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.720]   or if it has that like slide out file thing.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.200]   And I've definitely gotten dinged on that.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.720]   So I would say if the hack is to look up
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.520]   what are the security requirements
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.040]   for the country you're transiting through,
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.680]   or I try at all costs to fly direct
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.840]   just to avoid these problems when possible.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.280]   Yeah, there used to be, I live in San Diego,
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.800]   but I live in North County and you used to be able to fly
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.520]   from Carlsbad Airport to LAX.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.760]   And so basically you could go anywhere from LAX, right?
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.360]   So that was always like the best way to do it.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.240]   But many times our Carlsbad flight would be canceled
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.320]   and we just have to drive,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.720]   literally drive to Carlsbad Airport.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.240]   Like if your flight's canceled,
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.360]   just keep going North to LAX.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:26.120]   But yeah, it's funny with the skateboard thing.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.440]   I remember, so my wife and I usually carry our skateboards
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.400]   when we go places, 'cause we like to skate around cities,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.560]   you know, just as transportation,
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.480]   if we're going by ourselves.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.840]   And we were coming back from,
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.080]   oh man, I can't remember where, somewhere.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:49.600]   And I think we were coming back from Brazil maybe.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.120]   And we were coming through the,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.760]   where you hand them your customs form.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.080]   And the guy, I'll never forget this.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.400]   He grabbed my customs form
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.320]   and he saw my skateboard in his peripheral
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.880]   and immediately was like, "Go that way, to secondary."
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.000]   'Cause he saw my skateboard.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.840]   It was so obvious the way that his, you know what I mean?
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.000]   I just saw his wheelchair and I'm like,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   "Oh, he's a problem, he's a skateboarder."
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.640]   And he looked up and he saw my face and he recognized it,
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.080]   but he'd already handed me this red card
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.440]   to go to secondary.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.400]   And he goes, "Oh, oh, you know what?
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.480]   "Just tell them you're in a hurry."
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.400]   I said, "Oh, is that gonna work for me?
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   "You're sending me to secondary
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.400]   "where they're gonna go through all my stuff
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.240]   "and I'm gonna tell them I'm in a hurry.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.960]   "That's probably not the best approach."
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.320]   And then my wife and I got into secondary,
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.720]   they wouldn't let us go to the bathroom.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.800]   They wouldn't, you know, we were like,
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.400]   we were very much being interrogated.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.040]   - Yeah, I mean, you've told lots of stories.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.560]   I'll encourage anyone here to go check out the internet
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.600]   for all the stories of you getting recognized
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.200]   as other people.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.720]   Is there a good one you don't share?
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.880]   Or a good one you haven't shared?
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.880]   - Yeah, yeah, it still happens all the time.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.360]   And it's weird now because obviously,
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.480]   as you would know, that meme kind of took off.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.840]   Or not the meme, but just me telling my story.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.160]   Like all the stories I tell are absolutely true, 100%.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.720]   But it started happening so,
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.920]   it would happen pretty frequently and I was sharing it.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.560]   And at some point people thought I was making it up.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.920]   So I kind of stopped sharing these incidents
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.800]   because people were just like, "Come on, like really?"
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.040]   But now it's gotten to a point where it's like this,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.520]   this vicious cycle where people now want to say it,
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.160]   even though they know who I am all the time.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.520]   So I would say that happens probably three times a day.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.960]   That interaction, like anyone ever tell you,
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.600]   you look like Tony Hawk?
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.960]   Yep, and you're the first today.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.800]   But then it happens genuinely at least once or twice too.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.160]   And when it happens genuinely,
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.280]   if people were following me around,
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.440]   they wouldn't believe it 'cause you know what I mean?
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.000]   Like they just, they hear about it and it's just like,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.840]   "All right, like enough with this non, you know,
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.200]   this whole, I don't even know what you'd call it,
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.080]   mistaken identity thing."
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.200]   - Yeah.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.960]   - But the, so yes, it still happens.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.920]   It happens as a joke.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.960]   It happens for real.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.520]   I think my favorite one as of late
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.000]   was that I was sitting at a gate
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.960]   and this guy was sitting across from me at the gate
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.560]   and he looked, he came over, he's like,
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.200]   "Man, you look just like Tony Hawk."
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.920]   Said, "Oh yeah, I know, I've heard that."
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.280]   He's like, "That's crazy."
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.960]   And then he went and sat back down
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.920]   and then a group of people came who did recognize me
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.640]   for real and wanted autographs and pictures.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.120]   And the whole time he's watching me laughing
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.080]   because he's in on the joke that it's not really me.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.920]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.280]   Like he and I are sharing this inside joke somehow
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.440]   that these people are crazy and they're mistaken,
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.400]   but he just thought it was hilarious.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.520]   - Did you ever tell him at the end or did he ever?
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.400]   - No, I don't, I just, it's up to them to,
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.240]   you know what I mean?
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.440]   To either decide that or to ask me.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.920]   It drives my daughter crazy because a lot of times
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.760]   people will say, "Oh, you look like Tony Hawk."
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.280]   I'm like, "Yeah, yeah."
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.240]   And they're like, "Oh, that's cool."
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.280]   And they walk away and my daughter's like,
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.200]   "Why didn't you tell him?"
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.880]   I go, "He didn't ask."
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.240]   - So if someone asks, you'll say, "Yeah."
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.240]   - Of course, yeah.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.080]   - All right.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.920]   Well, I hope whoever was sitting across from me
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.360]   at the airport is listening and they can finally
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.560]   come to terms with the fact that that was-
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.880]   - No, I think he had way more fun
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.080]   in his mind making fun of people.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.920]   - Yeah.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.200]   - Like that was his thing.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.720]   So I just let him run with it.
