[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   We find in the Gospel according to St. John in the first chapter, reading verses 26 and
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:14.880]   33, John answered them, saying, "I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.160]   whom ye know not.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.760]   And I knew him not, but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me,
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.920]   upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he which
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.480]   baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.480]   Now we are considering still this great statement about the Lord Jesus Christ baptizing with
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.680]   the Holy Ghost.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.320]   And at the moment we are concerned in bringing out and emphasizing the fact that the teaching
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.240]   of the New Testament concerning this baptism with the Holy Ghost is that it is ultimately
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:08.720]   designed for witness, for testimony, not primarily for sanctification, but for witness and for
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.720]   testimony.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.280]   We have been at pains to point out that much of the confusion concerning this doctrine
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.400]   arises because people will confuse it with sanctification and try to expound it in terms
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.800]   of Ephesians 5.18 and so on, which rarely has nothing to do directly with the baptism
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.040]   of the Holy Ghost at all.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.760]   However, we are emphasizing this particular matter, and we are doing so not only that
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.480]   we may experience and enjoy what is intended for us and possible to us as Christian people,
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:56.080]   but still more urgently, in order that we may truly bear our witness in this age in
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.920]   which we live, with all its tragedy and its problems, its pain and its sorrow.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.400]   There is no question that the greatest need of the world is a mighty visitation of the
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.360]   Spirit of God, a re-authentication of the truth of the gospel and the message of the
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.360]   Bible.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.760]   Therefore, there is nothing, surely, that is more urgent for any of us than this particular
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.760]   doctrine.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.200]   Here, as John the Baptist says, is to be something that is to characterize the rule and the reign
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.720]   and the ministry of our blessed Lord, that he will baptize with the Holy Ghost.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.720]   We remember how he told his own apostles at the very end, just before his ascension, to
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.360]   tarry in Jerusalem until they should be endued with power from on high, and that that would
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.640]   lead to there being witnesses unto him, both in Jerusalem and Samaria and in the uttermost
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.840]   parts of the earth.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.240]   Well, now, we are in the process at the moment of considering how it is that the baptism
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.360]   of the Spirit enables us to act as witnesses.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:17.920]   And this, we see, leads us to consider what are the marks and the signs, or the results,
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.280]   if you like, of this baptism.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.960]   And we have noted a number of them.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   How invariably a man who is baptized with the Holy Ghost has an unusual sense of God
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   and of his glory.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.760]   How he is aware of a sense of awe.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.760]   How he is invariably humbled.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.440]   The Bible is full of that kind of thing.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.080]   You get men having visions in the Old Testament, and their first reaction is to say with Isaiah,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.480]   "Woe is unto me, for I am undone.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.360]   I am a man of unclean lips."
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.200]   The measure to which we have ever known any sense of humbling is the measure of our knowledge
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.640]   of God and of his Christ.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   Then it goes on to a wonderful assurance, a special, exceptional, immediate, direct
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.360]   assurance of the love of God to us in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.040]   The knowledge of sins forgiven, loss of the fear of death, confidence with regard to the
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.880]   eternal future, as that hymn we have just been singing puts it so well.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.720]   We die triumphantly if we have known the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.240]   We do not just slink out of life or just disappear.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.200]   There is a triumph and a glory always about such people.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.600]   And there is very eloquent testimony to this in the many, many biographies of the last
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.400]   days and the death of the saints of God.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.120]   Nothing is more wonderful, as John Wesley used to put it, he used to claim for his people,
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.280]   our people, he used to say, die well.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.160]   And there is nothing that is more significant about any man in this world than the way in
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.480]   which he dies.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.080]   The Christian dies in the light of the glory.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.200]   His end, his exit is triumphant and is glorious.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.160]   Well these are some of the results.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   Then we have gone on to consider the joy and the gladness experienced already in this world.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.080]   You noticed it in the reading this morning in 1 Thessalonians, how in much affliction
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.680]   and yet with joy in the Holy Ghost these people had believed the gospel and had joined themselves
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.560]   to the church and had continued in the Christian life.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.520]   Love to God and a desire to glorify him before men.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.440]   And we ended last Sunday morning on this note, the light and the knowledge and the understanding
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.720]   that are given.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.680]   This is the way to learn the truth of God.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.760]   Now the implications of all these things, of course, are obvious and self-evident and
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.440]   we must not turn aside to them.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.400]   But surely this is a thing that the church must reconsider.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.680]   The church has fallen into the error of thinking that men can get this knowledge by academic
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   teaching and learning.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.920]   I am not here to decry that.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.300]   Academic teaching and learning are of importance, but they are not all important.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.560]   And the tragedy of the last hundred years has been to put a premium on such things.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.800]   And men boast of their degrees and diplomas and their passing of examinations and so on.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.080]   Well it is all right, but that is not the way to know God.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.640]   It is through the spirit, through the baptism of the spirit, that one comes to this knowledge.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.960]   I quoted to you the cases of Pascal and Thomas Aquinas, which surely should put us right
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.720]   on this matter once and forever.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:56.080]   When Christianity becomes a subject in a seminary or in a university, well then, I say, we have
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.320]   really departed from the faith.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.560]   These things are aids, they are helps, but we have lost our sense of proportion.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.560]   The knowledge is given by the Holy Ghost.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.520]   And thus it has often happened that people like Priscilla and Aquila, as we have seen,
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.560]   are able to put right a brilliant learned man like Apollos and others.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.040]   And that has been repeated endlessly throughout the century.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.720]   Well now then, we have there been looking in a sense at the evidences or the results
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.760]   or the marks of the baptism of the Holy Ghost within us ourselves.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.280]   They more or less can all be subsumed under the category of the heading of subjective
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.360]   evidences.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:48.880]   We now turn to the external evidences, the evidences that are apparent to those who are
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.440]   outside and looking on.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.280]   And this of course is equally important.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.000]   It's dealt with in the Scriptures, and we've therefore got to deal with it.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.920]   And it is always a matter which is clearly of prime importance, because if the object
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.520]   of the baptism of the Spirit is to enable us to bear witness, well, we bear witness
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.520]   to other people.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.560]   And therefore there must be something about this which becomes evident and obvious to
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.640]   others.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.680]   In defining the meaning of the baptism of the Spirit, we put considerable emphasis
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.640]   on that, that it's not only something a man himself knows for certain, but other
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.640]   people know.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.320]   Very well, we're now proceeding to look at that in a more detailed manner.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.680]   Anybody who's familiar with the Book of the Acts of the Apostles will know at once,
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.200]   of course, that this is something very striking.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:49.600]   The moment the apostles and the company assembled in the upper room were baptized with the Holy
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.120]   Ghost, it became evident and obvious to all who were around and about.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:01.520]   And a great stir was created in Jerusalem, and people came gathering together to look
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.520]   into this matter.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.360]   There, there it is at once.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.420]   Now, we shall have to go again into this in detail.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:16.800]   But the point I want to establish is that the thing was patent and evident.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.840]   Peter makes use of this in his sermon on the Day of Pentecost when he puts it like this
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.680]   in Acts 2.33.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.360]   "Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:39.440]   the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which you now see and hear."
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:48.000]   So he's appealing to this external evidence, this obvious evidence of that which had taken
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.840]   place in them and to them.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:58.800]   But perhaps the most striking example of all of this is what happened in the house of Cornelius,
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.480]   which is described in the tenth chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.240]   We read that while Peter, verse 44, "While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.040]   fell on all them which heard the word."
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.960]   And if your doctrine of the Holy Ghost doesn't include this idea of the Holy Ghost falling
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.520]   upon people, it's seriously, grievously defective.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.920]   And this, it seems to me, has been the trouble, especially during this present century, indeed
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.880]   almost for a hundred years, the whole notion of the Holy Ghost falling upon people has
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.420]   been discontinuanced and has been discouraged.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.820]   And if you read many of the books on the Holy Ghost, you'll find it's not even mentioned
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:48.320]   at all, which is surely one of the prime explanations of the present state of the Christian Church.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:54.440]   Then you go on to read, "And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished,
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:11:01.440]   as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.600]   of the Holy Ghost.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.760]   For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.200]   Then Peter answered them, and said, Peter, can any man forbid water, that these should
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?"
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:24.880]   Now you will remember that in the next chapter, the Apostle Peter is in a sense being called
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.320]   to book by the authorities up at Jerusalem for having admitted the Gentiles into the
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.440]   Christian Church.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.280]   The Jews couldn't understand this.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.360]   They stumbled at it.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.120]   And Peter falls back on this argument.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:43.040]   "As I began to speak," he says, "the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.520]   Then remembered I the word of the Lord."
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.240]   Then he quotes the statement of John the Baptist and so on.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.840]   Then he says, "For as much then as God gave them the like gift as he did to us who believed
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:00.080]   on the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I that I could withstand God?"
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.720]   He appeals to the evidence.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   It is obvious to those who are outside.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.520]   And so, of course, you go on reading right through this book.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:18.760]   And it is there by implication in the epistles, and it is something that is substantiated
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.280]   by the subsequent history of the Christian Church.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.920]   In other words, we are now looking at this.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:30.640]   There are certain external manifestations of that which we have been aware of within
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.640]   ourselves.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.960]   What are they?
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:40.520]   Well now, the first that I would notice is this one.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.480]   I wonder whether this comes as a surprise to any of you.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.160]   Facial appearance.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.880]   Facial appearance.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.600]   Now you remember the story we are told, the account given in the Old Testament of what
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:04.440]   happened to Moses when he was up on the mount with God, receiving the Ten Commandments and
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:10.880]   receiving instructions about the construction of the tabernacle and the forms of worship
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.880]   and so on.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.720]   And you remember how we read that he was coming down the mount at last and the people rushed
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.720]   forward to meet him.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:23.080]   And suddenly they stood back in some terror and alarm.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:29.520]   And the explanation that is given is this, that the face of Moses was shining.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.800]   Moses did not know it, but his face was shining.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:40.960]   And his face was shining because he had been in the presence of God.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:49.440]   And something of the glory of God was being reflected back from the face of Moses.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   This is a great mystery.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.200]   It is a wonderful thing.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:58.320]   You get the same idea, of course, in the account of our Lord's transfiguration.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.400]   How there he was transfigured before them.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:09.320]   And there came a kind of brightness upon him, a glory, which the apostles had not observed
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.320]   in him before.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:16.480]   Well, now, that is the kind of thing to which I am making reference.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:23.280]   And what seems so clear is that because the baptism with the Holy Spirit does bring one
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:32.080]   into this presence of God and into a living and an active realization of God and his glory,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:38.440]   it is not at all surprising that one of the inevitable concomitants is that something
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:46.000]   happens even to the physical, facial appearance of people who receive this baptism.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.120]   Now, you get the evidence for this, as I say, particularly in the book of the Acts of the
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.120]   Apostles.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.040]   And there it is in the second chapter.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.280]   It was evident at once to the populace of Jerusalem that something had happened to these
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.280]   men.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.600]   Now, not only because they speak with other tongues, with other languages, but everything
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.720]   about them, their very appearance, their conduct, and various other things to which we shall
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.320]   be referring later.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:19.600]   And again I would emphasize that statement in that thirty-third verse in the second chapter
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.360]   of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:26.040]   "Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:34.120]   the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this which you now see and hear."
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:40.920]   They were hearing the tongues, the languages, all speaking the wonderful works of God in
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.360]   their own languages, but in addition to what they heard, they saw.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:52.400]   Now, this is something that is very much neglected, but which is very important.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:16:00.360]   You see, it was evident by looking at these people that something had happened to them.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.760]   Let me give you another example to show you the same thing.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:10.680]   Take what we are told about the martyr Stephen in the last verse of the sixth chapter of
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.440]   this book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:17.520]   Here was a man, we are told, filled with the Holy Ghost and with faith, and because of
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:23.680]   his preaching and teaching and his other works, he fell foul of the authorities, and they
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.440]   arrested him and they put him on trial.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:33.240]   So verse thirteen tells us, "They set up false witnesses, which said, 'This man ceaseth
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:38.440]   not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law, for we have heard
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:43.960]   him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.800]   which Moses delivered us.'
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:57.160]   Then all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.640]   been the face of an angel."
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:10.760]   Now, this is sheer history, and the explanation is the one that I am giving you.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:17.280]   This again is nothing but some reflection of the glory of God, like the face of an angel.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.040]   And the angels are in the realm of glory, they are in the presence of God.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:29.760]   And everything in that realm reflects something of the glory of God.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:35.460]   That is why I am emphasizing this, because if you read the accounts of the great revivals
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:42.520]   in the history of the Church, you will find that this is something that has been frequently
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:49.760]   noted and it has been the means of the conversion of many people.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:56.880]   They have just beheld the face of certain people who had been filled with the Spirit
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:04.760]   suddenly in the revival, and they have been amazed at the glory, the wonder, something
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.120]   luminous in the face.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.440]   And that has often led to the conversion of people.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:17.200]   Now, lest you may think that I am only talking about exceptional people, one of the most
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.640]   extraordinary and wonderful personal testimonies that I think I have ever had the privilege
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:35.040]   of listening to was the experience of a woman still alive in a very humble calling in life,
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.200]   if you can draw such distinctions, but that is what the world does.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.160]   I put it like that, that you may know what I am saying.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.840]   I am not talking about some highly cultured person, I am not talking about some erudite
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:52.080]   person, I am talking about somebody who performs very menial tasks.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:58.280]   I had the privilege of hearing her tell me of how she became a Christian.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:05.520]   And it happened in a revival that took place in the island of Lewis before the last war.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.640]   I am not referring to what has happened there since the last war, but what happened before
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.640]   the last war.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.240]   We have not heard much about it, but there was a visitation of the Spirit of God in the
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:20.640]   island of Lewis from April to September 1939.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:28.120]   This woman gave me an account of it, how meetings were held in a house, not even in a chapel.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.520]   She was not very interested in these things, but a friend of hers became interested.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.480]   At last she was persuaded to go to one of these meetings of prayer that was held in
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.480]   a house.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:44.820]   Having failed to get in once or twice because of the crowd, she eventually succeeded in
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.820]   getting in.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:51.080]   The thing that led to her conversion was the sight of the face of a little child in that
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   house.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:20:00.960]   The little child was there, and this woman suddenly saw the face of this child shining.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:08.080]   That was the means of her conviction of sin, of need of a Savior, and of her salvation,
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.800]   and her being filled with the Holy Ghost.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.260]   So here is something I feel which we have tended to neglect.
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:22.860]   People concentrate only on the tongues in Acts 2, but there are evidences quite apart
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:27.160]   from tongues, and in many instances where there have been no tongues at all, things
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.160]   like this.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:33.940]   In the accounts of revivals, I have often heard it from people whom I have known well
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:41.300]   and intimately, who experienced something of the revival in Wales of 1904 and 5.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:46.860]   It was frequently said about Mr. Evan Roberts, who was so signally used in that revival.
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:54.540]   People were amazed when they just saw his face and this shining quality.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:21:01.460]   Of course, many of you remember what we are told about the saintly Robert Murray M'Cheyne
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:08.940]   in his church in Dundee at the end of the thirties of the last century and the first
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.340]   two or three years of the forties of the last century.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:17.500]   It is said, and it is indicated so many, many times, that when Robert Murray M'Cheyne
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:22.700]   simply entered his pulpit during this period, he had simply to enter the pulpit, and before
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:28.620]   he had opened his mouth, people used to begin to weep and were convicted of sin.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.220]   He had not uttered a sound, he had not said a word.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.220]   Well, what was it?
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:40.100]   Well, the explanation was that these men had come from the presence of God, and the Spirit
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:49.340]   was poured forth, and one of the results is something that can be seen even externally.
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:54.380]   I am emphasizing this, my dear friends, because I am convinced that the main trouble with
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:59.800]   most of us and with the Church in general for certain is simply this.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:06.860]   We seem to have forgotten the presence of the Spirit and the power of the Spirit.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:15.540]   We have become so formed, everything so set, so organized, all in the control of men, and
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:22.180]   we have forgotten this other evidence, the power and the glory of the Spirit and the
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.980]   sanctity and the holiness.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:29.340]   I am convinced that the greatest need of the Church is to realize again the activity of
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.340]   the Holy Ghost.
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:39.540]   You see, we organize, organize meetings, organize campaigns, but that is because very largely
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:44.300]   we have forgotten this element that I am trying to emphasize to you.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:51.940]   When the Spirit comes, his evidence is unmistakable, and the results are amazing understanding.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:58.460]   So the next thing that I hasten to emphasize is the effect of the baptism of the Spirit
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.220]   upon the speech of men.
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:05.860]   Now when I say the speech of men, I really mean preaching.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.340]   Or, not only preaching, I mean personal conversation also.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.300]   I am not yet dealing with the question of tongues.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.220]   I am going to deal with that under the heading of gifts.
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:24.020]   I am here now talking about the effect of the baptism of the Spirit upon men's speaking
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.580]   in what we regard as the ordinary meaning of that term.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:33.980]   Now I refer to it, I say, both as it happens in private conversation and also in public
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.740]   declaration in preaching.
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.460]   Here again is something that has been promised, of course.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:45.660]   You remember how the promise is given there in John 7, 37 to 39.
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.860]   "Our Lord stood up on the last day of the feast and said, 'If any man thirsts, let
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.380]   him come unto me and drink.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:57.040]   He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.500]   of living water.'
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.560]   But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.820]   For the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because the Jesus was not yet glorified."
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.100]   Now that is a universal statement.
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:15.060]   And it is true that when people are baptized with the Spirit, they discover certain things
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:21.020]   happen in this matter of testimony and of speaking to others, whether in private conversation
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.140]   or, as I say, in a more public manner.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:29.820]   And then our Lord, as I have reminded you already, tells the disciples, "Tarry in Jerusalem."
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.820]   Stay where you are.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:40.100]   "Until ye be endued with power from on high, then ye will be able really to speak."
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:46.860]   Now we must again reiterate this point and emphasize it, because it is obviously crucial.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.940]   Here were men who had been with him during the three years, and heard his preaching and
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.780]   seen his miracles.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:59.140]   There were men who had seen him crucified, who had seen him die, who had seen the body
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.380]   taken down and buried in a grave.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.580]   They had seen the empty grave.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:07.780]   Not only that, they had seen him with their naked eyes as he had appeared to them in the
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.860]   upper room and in various other places.
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:15.340]   And they had received his teaching, his exposition of the Old Testament.
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:20.460]   And here he was with them at this moment, standing together on the Mount of Olivet.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.820]   Well, you would have thought, "What more do you need?"
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:31.140]   Here are obviously men who have had the best training conceivable in order to make them
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.140]   preachers.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.140]   They have got all the facts.
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.580]   They have even witnessed them.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.100]   What more can be needed?
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.980]   Yet our Lord says, "Stay where you are.
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.980]   You need something.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.900]   You need power."
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.300]   And that is, of course, what happened to them on the day of Pentecost.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:53.380]   Now it is there, you see, when you look at it like that, that you see how utterly ridiculous
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:59.420]   it has been for the last hundred years for us to put all our emphasis upon academic teaching
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:05.900]   and learning, as if that is the thing that is most essential to make a preacher.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:11.060]   Of all the people that I have read of in the course of history, I know of no people who
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:20.180]   have such a responsibility at the bar of eternal judgment as the people, roughly, from 1850
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.180]   until today.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:25.140]   The change took place somewhere in the fifties of the last century.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:30.660]   Until then, the great impact of the evangelical revival of the eighteenth century still persisted,
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:35.060]   and there had been other revivals, and people knew about the power of the Spirit.
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:41.460]   Suddenly, we all became so respectable and so learned, and people said, "Ah, that old
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.540]   type of preaching is no longer good enough."
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.300]   The people are now receiving education, and they are beginning to read, and they are becoming
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.060]   learned, and so on.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:53.280]   And the middle classes have become prosperous and wealthy.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.020]   And you have that most devastating thing that has afflicted the life of the Church.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:05.540]   Victorianism entered into the Churches, particularly the free Churches, which now began to imitate
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.060]   other forms of worship.
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:14.900]   And the great word became dignity—dignity, formality, learning, culture, and so on.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.100]   Now, it is easy, perhaps, for me to criticize.
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:22.940]   The temptation to such men must have been very great, but, oh, why didn't they keep
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.700]   to the New Testament?
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.820]   Why did they make this fatal error?
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:33.660]   And so, the whole notion of preaching became increasingly academic and removed from the
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.740]   Old Testament.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:40.020]   And a man was judged in terms of, as I say, his degrees and his diplomas, not his anointing
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.020]   with the Holy Ghost.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:47.860]   Now, I don't want to make an either/or of this, but I am here to say this, that if you
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:53.180]   neglect this element, all the rest will avail you nothing.
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.060]   And it hasn't.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:28:01.080]   In a sense, it has emptied the Churches, and there is no hope until we return to the New
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.620]   Testament, the primitive pattern.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:09.100]   Here it is, this which happens even in the speaking and the speech.
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.100]   What is it?
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:17.140]   Well, the great element that stands out at once, of course, is the power and the liberty.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:22.780]   This is most striking, as it has always been in all the subsequent history of the Christian
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.780]   Church.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.580]   Now, you get foreshadowings of this in the Old Testament.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.580]   Take the prophets of the Old Testament.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.460]   Some of them were unusual men, but some were very ordinary men.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.020]   Amos tells us that he was a most ordinary man.
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.780]   He says, "I am neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet."
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.140]   He was a man who looked after cattle and so on.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.720]   But you see, he is unable to speak, and so are all these prophets.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.460]   And what happened was that they received a kind of divine afflatus.
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:59.500]   They were filled not only with knowledge, but with an ability to speak, which astonished
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.300]   them themselves.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:05.700]   And you remember Jeremiah refers to a fire burning in his bones.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.820]   He decided not to speak anymore, because every time he spoke he got into trouble.
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.740]   He got an unpopular message, and he said, "I'll never speak again."
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.220]   But the fire was burning in his bones.
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.940]   The Holy Spirit does that.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.740]   So you get these suggestions of it there in the Old Testament.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:27.260]   And then let me remind you again of what we are told once more, even before the Day of
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.420]   Pentecost, how you get kind of foreshadowings of this.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:36.260]   In Luke 1, verse 41, for instance, I read, "And it came to pass that when Elizabeth
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:42.060]   heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:48.100]   the Holy Ghost, and she spake out with a loud voice and said..."
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.100]   There it is.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.500]   And you get the same thing about Zacharias in verse 67.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:57.820]   "And his father, the father of John the Baptist, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Ghost
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:05.180]   and prophesied, saying, 'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited and redeemed
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.180]   his people.'"
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:11.500]   And, of course, the preaching of John the Baptist can only be explained in the same
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.500]   way.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:17.100]   We are told of him that he was filled with the Spirit from his mother's womb, and thus
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:23.100]   he spoke with the power and liberty that made him quite a phenomenon.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:28.660]   And as you go on reading then in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, after the Day
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.460]   of Pentecost, you are at once struck by this same thing.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:36.660]   The apostle Peter is able to stand up in Jerusalem, though he is just a fisherman, and he can
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:43.220]   expound the Scriptures, and he speaks with authority and with great power and with unusual
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.220]   liberty.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.900]   This is the thing that always happens.
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:50.820]   We read again in Acts 4, 31 and following, "And when they had prayed, the place was
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.540]   shaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost,
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.540]   and they spake the word of God with boldness."
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:04.620]   And on it goes, "With great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:10.420]   Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all."
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:15.180]   And so it goes on right through the New Testament.
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:24.060]   You remember the apostle Paul, this outstanding genius, this most learned Pharisee, this erudite
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.060]   man.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:32.660]   One of the most amazing things he ever said is that statement in 1 Corinthians 2, where
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:38.660]   he reminds these Corinthians who were interested in philosophy and so on, "And I, brethren,
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:43.260]   I came to you, came not with excellency of speech nor of wisdom, declaring unto you the
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.860]   testimony of God.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.740]   For I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:52.380]   And let's not forget that that was his message.
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:56.060]   He didn't talk about himself nor his experiences nor his gifts.
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.380]   He preached Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.700]   "And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:08.700]   And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom, but in demonstration
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.220]   of the Spirit and of power."
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.220]   That's it.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.140]   Power of God, not the wisdom of men.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:19.060]   He was dismissed by the learned as being a babbler.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.940]   They said his presence is weak and his speech is contemptible.
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:27.020]   It wasn't their idea of speaking, but oh, there was power there, and the power manifested
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.820]   itself in what happened to the people who listened to him.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:34.820]   And then I read to you at the beginning how he reminds the Thessalonians of how the gospel
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:35.820]   came to them.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:41.860]   "For our gospel came not unto you in word only," he says, "but in power, in the Holy
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:46.060]   Ghost, and in much assurance."
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.060]   That's the thing.
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.780]   It runs right through the New Testament.
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:53.780]   And you get the Apostle Peter saying exactly the same thing in his first epistle and in
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.620]   the first chapter.
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.860]   He talks about this great salvation in verses 10 to 12.
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:03.300]   He says, "Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, which
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:07.860]   prophesied of the grace that should come unto you, searching what or what manner of time
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:12.580]   the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:18.020]   sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow, unto whom it was revealed, that not
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:25.820]   unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:34.140]   by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven,
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:39.780]   which things the angels desire to look into."
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:46.740]   Now there it is in the New Testament, and the evidence is so perfectly plain and clear.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:53.020]   Now when you come to the history of the Church, you get exactly the same thing.
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:57.780]   And that is why I have always said that there is nothing next to the Bible which is more
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:03.780]   encouraging than to familiarize oneself with the great history of the Church.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:08.580]   There is a feeling, teaching abroad, that all this, "Oh yes, that was New Testament,
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.220]   that was only the beginning, but nothing like that happens afterwards, this is only the
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.220]   beginning."
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:16.780]   My dear friends, the answer to that is the history of the Church, and especially the
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.900]   history of revivals.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:23.900]   And the story, of course, is a glorious one.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.980]   How at periods when the Church had become dead and lifeless, God would suddenly take
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:34.380]   hold of a man and pour his spirit upon him, and raise him up and transform his preaching.
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:38.660]   Now I haven't the time to go into all this, but it has been happening throughout the running
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.660]   centuries.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:44.340]   Let me just mention one or two which are striking because of the very age in which it happened
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:51.260]   to them, in the so-called dark Middle Ages, in the darkness and the ignorance which Roman
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.620]   Catholicism had produced.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:35:00.460]   There was a man whom God laid his hand upon in Germany, John Tawler, Tawler if you like.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:05.660]   He was a Roman Catholic priest, preaching in a great cathedral.
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.820]   But God suddenly took hold of this man and filled him with his spirit, and his whole
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.460]   preaching was transformed.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:17.940]   You can read books about him and certain others of these so-called mystics of that time, who
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:23.860]   even in the darkness of that era were burning and shining lights.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.980]   Everybody was aware that something had happened to them and they became phenomenal.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.220]   It's the only explanation of a man like Savonarola.
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:36.140]   You can't explain Savonarola except in terms of his being baptized and filled with the
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.140]   spirit.
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.100]   Then look at Martin Luther.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.540]   It's the only explanation of him.
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:46.180]   Do you remember something of the story of John Knox?
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:51.220]   It was said that Mary, Queen of Scots, used to say that she was more afraid of John Knox's
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:56.220]   prayers than she was of many battalions of English soldiers.
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.260]   And he certainly was so filled with the spirit that when he used to preach in Edinburgh and
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:06.660]   she was present listening, she used to be made to tremble, as Felix trembled as he was
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.860]   listening to the Apostle Paul.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.420]   Now, this is nothing but the power of the spirit.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:15.140]   It's not human ability, it's not human speech.
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.140]   It is this other, this power.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:24.660]   Hugh Latimer, here in the Church of England, he used to preach at St. Paul's Cross and
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:31.140]   he had exactly the same effect, possibly the greatest preacher of all the Protestant fathers.
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.140]   But it's true of all these men.
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:39.180]   Have you ever heard, I wonder, the story of a man called John Livingstone, who was a minister
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.980]   in the Church of Scotland in the first half of the 17th century?
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:49.020]   John Livingstone was a very able man and a very good minister.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:54.060]   But John Livingstone, writing the account of his life for his grandchildren towards
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:37:00.500]   the end of his life, refers to one day in his ministry and in his experience which he
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.500]   never forgot.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:07.060]   And it's just a perfect instance of this thing that I'm holding before you.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:12.100]   You know the communion seasons that they used to have in those days, and they still have
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:17.700]   them in certain sections of the Christian Church in Scotland, communion season twice
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.500]   a year only.
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:25.180]   But it used to begin on a Thursday, and there'd be meetings Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.900]   and then final meetings on the Monday.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:39.980]   Well, in the month of June, 1630, John Livingstone and others were present at a communion season
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:47.140]   in a place called Kirk of Shots, and it was decided that John Livingstone should be one
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:53.100]   of the preachers, the main preacher in fact, on Monday, June 21.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.460]   And he tells the story.
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:38:00.100]   He was always a good, what they'd call solid preacher, a man who expounded the Scriptures,
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:06.260]   knew the doctrines, was an able divider of the Scripture, and so on.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:12.020]   But here he was, he was due to preach on this Monday, and he tells the story how at about
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:16.660]   between eight and nine o'clock in the morning he went out into the fields to pray.
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.700]   And he was attacked by the devil who told him to go home, to disappear.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.140]   Who was he to preach to a great crowd of people?
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.780]   A good minister in an ordinary way, but not a man for such an occasion.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:31.460]   And he was seriously tempted to go home, or to disappear, to get out of sight somewhere,
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:35.780]   because he was afraid of this ordeal of preaching to such a number of people.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:40.260]   However, he overcame the attack of the devil, and the time came for him to preach, and he
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:47.220]   took his text, Ezekiel 36, 25, and 26, on this very matter of the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:51.380]   And he goes on to say how he preached for an hour and a half, and then he came to his
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.060]   application, which he'd intended to be brief.
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:39:02.860]   An hour and a half of exposition, outlining the doctrine, then application.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.740]   But he suddenly found that there was something happening to him, and the application which
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:10.660]   he'd intended to be brief went on for another hour.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:14.420]   And as it went on, astounding things were happening.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:18.940]   People were falling to the ground, others breaking down, weeping.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:25.820]   Well, the end of the story was this, that it was estimated that at least 500 people
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:30.020]   were converted as the result of that one sermon.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:34.500]   When I say converted, I don't mean that they just came forward at the end.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.780]   They didn't do things like that in those days.
[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.660]   There was no need to do them.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.460]   I mean not that they signed some form.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.780]   No, no.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:48.340]   They were converted in the sense that their whole lives were changed, and remain changed,
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:53.900]   and they joined the Christian church with no pressure for decision brought upon them,
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.700]   none of the usual machinery that we've become so accustomed to.
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.700]   Nothing like that at all.
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.100]   All that only began about the middle of the last century.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:06.980]   But this was the power of the Spirit, and this is what's so remarkable.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:10.020]   He never had a service like that again.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.740]   It was the one and only time in his life.
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:18.580]   He lived many years afterwards, but he never forgot that day, and he goes on referring
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.700]   to it in his account of his life.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.700]   Well, now, that's the kind of thing I mean.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:30.060]   Here is a man, you see, taken up and suddenly enabled to speak with a power that he'd never
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:33.700]   known before, and that he never knew again.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.420]   There's only one explanation of that.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.060]   That's the Holy Ghost, my friends.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:44.700]   That's the baptism of the Holy Ghost, enabling a man to speak and to preach with power.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:51.660]   I've read to you already some of the testimony of how Howard Harris, two hundred years ago
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:56.420]   in Wales, was baptized with the Spirit in that church tower, and you see, it was as
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.780]   the result of that that these men began to speak with power.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.060]   Now, listen to this.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.980]   This is so fascinating to me.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:11.220]   This man was a schoolmaster, never intended being a preacher at all, but was satisfied
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.180]   to be a schoolmaster.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:18.460]   But then, as you remember, he was converted, and then after his conversion, and even after
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.720]   he'd had assurance, about three weeks later, he had this great baptism, which he always
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.300]   called his baptism with fire.
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.300]   Fire.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.740]   The fire and the power, doesn't matter which you call them.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.980]   Call it power, call it fire, call it liberty, doesn't matter.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.220]   It all means the same thing.
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.500]   He called it his baptism of fire.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.380]   Now, this is how it worked in his case.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:41.420]   He at once began to feel a concern for the men and women who lived round and about him,
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:46.140]   his own mother and brothers, and the people living in the neighborhood.
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:47.140]   And he didn't know what to do.
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:52.100]   Well, he thought, he suddenly felt that he, at any rate, could go and visit the sick.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.820]   And he began to visit the sick.
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.820]   Well, then he thought that wasn't enough, he must try and help them in some way.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:01.340]   Well, he'd got certain good books, certain pious books, and he thought, "Well, I'll
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:06.300]   just go to these people and I'll read these books to them."
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.540]   And he began to do it.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.860]   He was just reading out of books.
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:16.300]   But the power of the reading of somebody else's books, somebody else's writing, was so great
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.500]   that people were convicted of sin and converted.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.060]   And whenever it was heard that he was going to visit the sick person with one of his books,
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.540]   everybody crowded round.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:29.260]   And they just sat and listened to these men reading out of books, not even looking at
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.500]   them, not preaching, reading out of books.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:36.100]   And as the power came upon them, and this was the thing that led eventually to his becoming
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.500]   a preacher and an evangelist.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:45.740]   We are all familiar with the power that attended the preaching of George Whitefield.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:51.020]   From the very beginning, he knew that he'd been called, sealed with the Spirit.
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:56.180]   He was aware of power, so that when he preached that first sermon of his in his own town in
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:02.100]   the city of Gloucester, tremendous things took place.
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:06.940]   And a complaint was made that fifteen people had been driven insane.
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:12.100]   And he was preaching, not an evangelistic sermon, but preaching on the value of Christian
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.300]   fellowship.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.680]   But this is the power.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.300]   Everybody knows the story of John Wesley.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.100]   He couldn't be more learned, but he was a hopeless preacher.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.380]   He was no good at all.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:24.020]   He was a miserable failure when he went out to Georgia in America.
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.340]   He came back utterly disconsolate.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:31.340]   Of course, he could give all of his learned sermon, but it was quite useless.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:37.540]   But after that experience in Aldersgate Street, this man suddenly begins to preach with power.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.220]   He becomes an evangelist.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:43.820]   "Well," I say with the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, "time would fail me, but I'm
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.620]   simply holding these things before you."
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:53.060]   My dear friends, to remind you of one thing only, the power of the Holy Ghost, this living
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:57.380]   power of the Holy Ghost.
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:04.340]   Some of you read the autobiography of Charles G. Finney, same thing.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:08.540]   Let me tell you one other story.
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:17.660]   In 1859 and 1858, for that matter, there was a religious movement, a religious revival.
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:21.260]   It was in America in '57.
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:27.660]   It was in Northern Ireland in 1858, came over to Wales in 1859.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.820]   How do you explain a thing like this?
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:35.780]   This is a proof to you, again, of the power of the Spirit coming upon a man.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:41.060]   There was a man, again, a most ordinary preacher in Wales of the name of David Morgan.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.220]   And I say ordinary, I mean ordinary.
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:47.900]   He was a man of little ability and had practically no training at all, but he was a good man
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:52.940]   and a godly man, and had started preaching as a carpenter and eventually had been set
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.260]   aside for the work of the ministry.
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:59.860]   And this was the man who was used, above all others, in the revival of 1859 in Wales.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.500]   But this was his story.
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.620]   He was in a meeting one night and he was very moved.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:13.180]   But he said to a friend later, he said, "I went to bed that night, as usual, David Morgan.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:19.340]   I'd felt power in the service, but I went to bed that night, David Morgan."
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:23.060]   But he said, "You know, when I woke up the next morning, I realized I was a different
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.420]   man."
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.140]   He said, "I felt like a lion.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.580]   I felt great power."
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:34.620]   And he began to preach with tremendous power, and it went on for two years.
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:40.260]   And then he said to this same friend, one night he said again, "I went to bed filled
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:44.660]   with this power that had accompanied me for two years.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:52.380]   I woke up the next morning and found that I was David Morgan once more."
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:57.540]   And he continued to be David Morgan until he died about some fifteen years or so later.
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.300]   Now, my dear friends, there's only one way of explaining a thing like that.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:07.420]   You see, that's the Holy Spirit coming upon a man and filling him, and then leaving him
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:08.620]   where he was before.
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.540]   It doesn't mean he'd done anything wrong.
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.820]   It just means that the Spirit is Lord.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.380]   He can give this power.
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:17.660]   He can withdraw this power.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:21.500]   You all remember the story I've told you several times about D.L.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.500]   Moody.
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:26.260]   What made that man what he was was that baptism that came to him on the street in New York
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.260]   City.
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:28.740]   Dr. Torrey, R.A.
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.700]   Torrey, tells us exactly the same thing.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.860]   His great missions were entirely the result of this.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.020]   And if you've ever read the life of a man called Dr. A.B.
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:44.060]   Simpson, who started the Christian and Missionary Alliance, you'll find precisely the same
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.060]   thing there.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.780]   Again, an able and a learned man, but conscious that there was something ineffective about
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.700]   his work and ministry.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:55.220]   And then suddenly he's filled with the Spirit and his whole ministry is transformed and
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:58.460]   has led to incalculable results.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:59.740]   Now here it is.
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:08.340]   Let me close this service by telling you a story on a much simpler level.
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:12.860]   You may say, "Ah, well, but all these men you've been dealing with have been exceptional
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:13.860]   men."
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.860]   I grant that in certain ways they all were exceptional men by nature.
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.580]   The point I'm trying to establish is that that isn't a thing that accounts for the
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:22.180]   fact that we know about them.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:26.460]   We'd never have heard of them were it not that the power of the Spirit had come upon
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.460]   them.
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:35.220]   But I'll tell you something much nearer to our own level.
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:40.380]   I don't believe I've ever stated this in public before, but I do it to the glory of
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:50.380]   God and I do it in order to forewarn you beforehand against certain criticisms that people bring.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.980]   "Ah, this is only for exceptional people."
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.980]   It isn't.
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:53.980]   I was in a prayer meeting.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.700]   I can't remember at the moment what year it was.
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.180]   I could easily work it out.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:04.420]   A prayer meeting which those of us who were in it will never forget.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:08.060]   I remember very well that it was in the month of June.
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.580]   It was a Monday evening prayer meeting which we had regularly in the church where I was
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:12.580]   then minister.
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:19.100]   We'd had a remarkable Sunday in many ways, but we came to the meeting as usual.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:23.460]   And I'd called upon somebody to open by reading Scripture and prayer.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:27.460]   The meeting started at 7.15.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.140]   And this man had read the Scripture and had prayed.
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.740]   Another man got up and prayed in the same way.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:40.660]   Then another man got up to pray, a man we all knew very well, a simple man, a very ordinary
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.940]   man from the intellectual standpoint.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:48.420]   Indeed, I must say this, and he wouldn't resent it if he's no longer alive and his family
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.300]   wouldn't resent it.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.580]   A man who had certain defects.
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:53.580]   We all have defects.
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:59.140]   He had certain striking defects, self-important little men.
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:04.900]   And a man whom we did not in any sense regard as either unusually spiritual or in any other
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.900]   way unusual.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:11.740]   And I'd heard this man pray many a time.
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:18.940]   However, this particular evening, this man had not uttered more than two or three sentences
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:25.580]   before I was aware and everybody else became aware of something most extraordinary.
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:33.340]   He was halting normally, humbling, pedestrian, ordinary.
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.740]   Let me even use the word boring.
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.660]   But suddenly this man was entirely transformed.
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:47.420]   His voice deepened, a power came into it, even in his speech.
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:55.860]   And he prayed in the freest, most powerful manner I think I've ever heard in my life.
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.940]   And you can imagine what happened.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:02.620]   The prayer continued without any intermission.
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:09.580]   And the freedom that had accompanied this man's prayer was given to all the others.
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.540]   And that went on until ten to ten.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.540]   I hadn't said a word.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:14.780]   There was no hymn singing.
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:16.140]   There was nothing.
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.980]   It was just this tremendous freedom, power in prayer.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:22.900]   One felt that one was outside time.
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:25.660]   One felt that one was in heaven.
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:28.940]   One was really lifted up to the spiritual realm.
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:35.540]   And here I was listening to people whom I knew so well with freedom and power and assurance.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:38.540]   People taking part who'd never prayed in public in their lives before and had been
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:43.980]   terrified at the very thought of it, found themselves praying.
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:46.340]   Well there it is.
[00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:49.860]   Let me leave it at that for this morning.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:56.060]   All I'm concerned to put to you good people, Christian people, is this.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:01.820]   Do you know anything about this spiritual power, this spiritual realm?
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:05.420]   Isn't this the thing that the Church has lost?
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.020]   Isn't this the thing that explains the state of the Christian Church?
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:15.460]   With all the talk about organizing and amalgamating and learning and this and that, how we are
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.300]   going to put it right?
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:22.860]   You know when the Spirit of God comes, even upon the most ordinary men, it can make a
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:30.420]   giant out of him that can shake a meeting and pass on an inspiration to others and transform
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.420]   them.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:32.420]   That's God's way.
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:33.420]   That's the Christian Church.
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:35.420]   That's New Testament Christianity.
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:39.300]   It's the only Christianity that's worth talking about at all.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.260]   This is the thing that's needed.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:49.460]   And this is one of the manifestations of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:51.300]   Amen.
