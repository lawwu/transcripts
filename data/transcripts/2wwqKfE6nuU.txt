[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   "Is it wrong for couples to pray against pregnancy?"
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   It's a question today from Chelsea in North Carolina.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Pastor John, thank you so much for all that you and the DesiringGod.org team do online.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   My question, "Do you think it is sinful for me to pray to not get pregnant?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   I love my children, but I don't think I can handle any more right now.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   My husband says it's not a sin, but I feel so selfish praying this prayer,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   especially since God has closed my closest friend's womb.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Is it biblically sound to even pray to God to close my womb for a season?"
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   My short answer is that it may be biblically sound to want a limited number of children
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   if your motives are informed by the priorities of Christ and the Scriptures.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I know some would say, "Well, that's contradictory,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   because it's precisely the priorities of Christ and the Scriptures
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   that tell us not to limit the number of children we have.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   They're a blessing, for goodness' sake. Why would you do that?"
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   But let me try to show you how I'm thinking,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   and then you can decide whether it's contradictory or not.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   In Genesis 2, verse 18, God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I will make him a helper fit for him."
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   So not good to be alone.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Then verse 24 says, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   and hold fast to his wife, and they become one flesh."
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Back in Genesis 1, 28, he says, "Be fruitful to this couple.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth."
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   In other words, it is right and normal and proper to pursue and to want family,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   marriage in the world as God created it,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   and to raise up lots of lovers of God who fill the earth with his glory.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I would say that's normal and good.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   God says, "It's not good for man to be alone.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Let him marry, become one flesh, and fill the earth."
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Nevertheless, when you get to the New Testament and you read 1 Corinthians 7, 26, following,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Paul, who speaks with the authority of Christ, says,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   "I think that in the view of the present distress,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   it is good for a person to remain as he is.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Are you bound to a wife? Don't seek to be free.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   But if you marry, you have not sinned."
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   So Paul is actually counseling people in that situation, at least,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   that singleness would be preferable to marriage.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And he gives his reasons later on, and they have to do with greater devotion to the Lord.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   But it's astonishing that in view of Genesis 2, 18,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   it's not good for a man to be alone, that Paul would say,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   "There are times and there are reasons when it would be better to be alone, not to marry."
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So the lesson I draw from this is that while it is normal and right and proper
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   in the ordinary order of creation for marriage to be pursued,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   nevertheless, now that Christ has come into the world,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   there are redemptive priorities, saving priorities,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   where it's right for redemptive and saving purposes for a person to forego marriage,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   which means that Christ-exalting kingdom principles and kingdom values
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   on this side of the cross relativize the mandate for marriage in the order of creation.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   In other words, the goodness of it is relative to the glorification of Christ
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   in the advance of his kingdom.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Now, if that's right thinking, then I'm suggesting that the same principles apply to having children
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and loving to have your quiver full of them, Psalm 127, which we should love.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   In other words, this is the normal, right, good pattern for all people in the order of creation.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   But there may be situations in life when, for Christ-exalting, God-centered, kingdom-advancing reasons,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   restricting the number of children that we have may be appropriate.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Now, I realize that, in a sense, I have not made matters easier for anyone,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   but perhaps even harder, because I have now put on you the burden of trying to know your own heart
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   and whether the motives for limiting the number of children that you have are, in fact,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Christ-exalting, God-centered, kingdom-advancing motives, or whether you're driven by fear or unbelief
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   or selfishness or worldliness. That's the real danger.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   But I think that is the kind of situation we find ourselves in regarding most decisions that we have to make in this world.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   God knows your heart, and he's a merciful Father. He loves children.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   But our having children is not his highest priority.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   His highest priority for his children is Christ-exalting faith,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Christ-magnifying joy that overflows in meeting the needs of others.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   That's his highest priority. He loves big families with lots and lots of children,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   but not for their own sake, but for Christ's sake.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And the issue is, do our lives with many or few children magnify the greatness of Christ,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   whether married or not, and however many children we have?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Such a good and careful balance of the biblical data that we have on this question. It's so important.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for tackling this. Thank you for the question, Chelsea.
