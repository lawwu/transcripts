[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.320]   Have you ever considered a career as a product manager?
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.120]   Or are you like me, and you question
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.600]   if you have enough technical product knowledge to even
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.320]   qualify?
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.520]   Perhaps you feel intimidated because you
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.280]   haven't managed a full lifecycle of a product before,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.840]   or you're unfamiliar with how to forecast revenue.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.260]   The thing about product management
[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.280]   is that it means different things to different companies.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.160]   It can vary by company size.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.720]   And there are different entry points to get your foot in.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.040]   So you should never stop yourself
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.020]   short when it comes to exploring what is
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.700]   the best opportunity for you.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.360]   I don't know about you, but the best way
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.640]   to learn about what it means to be a product manager
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.080]   is to get actual, practical advice from someone doing
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.880]   the job right now, today.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.380]   Someone to give you the real talk on what to expect,
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.800]   insights on the highs and the lows,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.780]   and an inside perspective on what hiring managers are
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.800]   looking for.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.080]   This person also needs to have credibility, which
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.760]   comes from having personally managed
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.460]   a diverse portfolio of products for different companies
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.280]   across hardware and software.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.720]   So today, we're going to have a conversation with Kevin Ngo.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.160]   He's a program lead on Google's Chrome OS
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.640]   and creator of Flowmask, which won the Biden administration's
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.760]   mask challenge in 2021.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.360]   In this interview, he's going to cover
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.560]   a lot of practical topics, including
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.560]   how to build and prioritize your roadmap,
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.360]   the importance of knowing when to let something go,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.840]   and what skills are important to succeed.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.820]   And you know what?
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.640]   It may not be what you think.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.360]   All right, let's get started.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.160]   Hey, guys.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.300]   Today, we're talking about product management.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.720]   And with us is Kevin Ngo.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.880]   Kevin, how are you doing?
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.380]   Hey, Tim.
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.200]   How's it going?
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.680]   Good.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.720]   Kevin, I'll be honest.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.040]   I've really been looking forward to this conversation
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.240]   because product management is probably the one field
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.680]   that I've always wondered if I should make a career shift to
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.240]   because I've worked in digital marketing my whole life
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.680]   and essentially manage the lifecycle of a website
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.600]   as a product.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.980]   And so I kind of always wondered,
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.200]   do my skill sets translate?
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.400]   But I've always hesitated because in my mind,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.960]   I really hold product management almost maybe too high
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.120]   of a bar above me.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.860]   And so I kind of rule myself out.
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.480]   And I'm just kind of thinking right now
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.800]   with everyone entering the job market because of layoffs
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   and whatnot, there might be a lot of people in my position
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.240]   who have the skills needed to make a shift to it,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.440]   but I may be hesitant.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.880]   And so I'd just love to kind of hear more about that
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.600]   because, again, I think they have a lot to learn from what
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.640]   you get to say.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.800]   And so can you help us understand
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.120]   what you've done with product management,
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.520]   what you've worked with, what products you've managed,
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.880]   and then kind of where you are today?
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.080]   So first off, thanks for having me.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.960]   I've been excited to join your podcast, obviously
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.120]   enthusiastic about sharing some of the experience
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.840]   I've had here in the Silicon Valley.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.880]   And oddly enough, I was laid off in 2001
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.920]   as a software engineer, as a very young software engineer.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.000]   And I went back to school for my MBA
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.120]   and ended up pivoting to product management
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.560]   at a time where it wasn't as popular of a role.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.920]   I didn't feel like too many people
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.400]   knew what product management was.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.760]   And so I think it's a great opportunity for people
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.400]   who are interested in pivoting their careers from what
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.000]   they're doing today.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.160]   I personally am incredibly biased
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.080]   because I think it's the best job in the world.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.120]   I tell everyone I meet to become a product manager.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.680]   I've gotten the chance to do some incredible stuff,
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.560]   travel the world, and see my products come to life.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.960]   And nothing gives me more pride than seeing stuff out
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.920]   in the real world.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.400]   So absolutely, I would highly recommend that.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.960]   So can you share some examples of products you've managed?
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.720]   Because I think everyone's dying to know.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.880]   You and I, we met at Logitech, so I know about that.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.360]   But yeah, tell us a little bit about what you've done.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.440]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.080]   It's been quite a wide range of things.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.040]   But I would say, historically, I've
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.360]   done primarily accessories and peripherals
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.400]   for starting with the iPod, making accessories for that,
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.520]   then shifting to iPhone when that launched,
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.240]   working directly with Apple on their MFI program,
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.840]   transitioning to Logitech, working on PC accessories,
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.200]   then through webcams, then moving over
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   to Barnes & Noble Nook when the e-reader industry was just
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.880]   firing up.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.840]   I helped them scale an accessories business
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.800]   from $0 to $100 million in 24 months, transitioning
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.960]   to Motorola from there, continuing on my hardware
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.320]   journey, then kind of shifting over to more hardware/software.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.120]   An intersection that I've had over the years
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.960]   is an intersection that I found that I truly love.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.080]   So it's a place that--
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.680]   I was at this augmented reality company called Meta
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.080]   as their head of product there, where
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.520]   we're doing futuristic headsets with augmented reality,
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.760]   seeing holograms, and getting all the software applications
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.320]   to run to power that stuff.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.360]   And then for the first time ever,
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.240]   doing full software at a company called Elementum,
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.080]   where we were trying to develop supply chain
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.080]   cloud-based applications.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.560]   And since then, I've been at Google doing program management
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.400]   on the Chromebook team.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.800]   So that is a freaking amazing history.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.920]   And the question that comes to mind right away
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.760]   is those products, while they share similarities,
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.840]   they're also very, very different, right?
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.840]   And going from software and hardware.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.040]   And one of the things that I've always told myself--
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.640]   or actually, the reason why I told myself
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.640]   I couldn't do these job roles is because maybe I
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.480]   didn't have the full, deep, technical knowledge
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.840]   of said product to be able to do that.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.400]   But you're kind of illustrating to me
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.360]   that you've somehow been able to shift
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.840]   into each of these categories and probably become an expert
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.920]   while you're on the job.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.640]   Absolutely.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.800]   Can you help us understand, what is that mindset?
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.600]   When you shift and going to a completely new and foreign
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.560]   product category, how do you do that?
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.720]   Yeah, it's funny, because I don't
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.200]   think I am truly an expert at an engineering level.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.240]   But I can kind of hold my own.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.520]   And we're talking categories that range from RF devices
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.000]   to audio products, where you have to understand frequency
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.840]   response, to image quality with webcams,
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.320]   to now a lot of the stuff I'm doing at Google,
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.040]   where there's a lot of interactions with Chrome OS
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.600]   and operating system.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.480]   Though, I think the one commonality
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.920]   that I've realized over the years,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.000]   and it's something that I'm trying to champion,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.080]   somehow instill in my kids, is a level
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.440]   of entrepreneurial spirit.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.040]   And I feel like if you embody that sense
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.840]   of entrepreneurial spirit, you can figure stuff out,
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.240]   no matter what you're thrown into.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.800]   And leveraging that hustle of figuring stuff out,
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.320]   learning, being enthusiastic about learning because you're
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.960]   excited about this category that you're diving into,
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.600]   I'm 100% confident, Tim, you can do it as well.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.160]   I think anyone can do it, honestly,
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.760]   because I've proven that I can transition
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.800]   from very different industries and categories
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.360]   and learning new things and kind of becoming
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.840]   almost an expert at all of them.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.480]   Again, I think product management
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.600]   is one of the most incredible roles out there in the world,
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.560]   and it gives everyone an opportunity
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.120]   to flex their entrepreneurial spirit.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.240]   Yeah, and I think we'll save this part of the conversation
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.920]   for later in the video, because we want to definitely dive deep
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.720]   into the skills you require, or even the aptitude,
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.960]   and maybe job experience, or indirect, right?
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.560]   And how do you make yourself stand out?
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.160]   Because things like entrepreneurial spirit,
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.840]   it reads kind of weird on paper.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.520]   And so it's like, how do you get that to come out
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.400]   in an interview, for example?
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.840]   So let's definitely talk about that.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.680]   But before we get there, maybe let's set the baseline here
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.560]   for a second.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.760]   So product management, I'll use myself as an example.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.240]   My view or understanding of product management
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.360]   is actually probably very minimal compared
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.800]   to the breadth that is the field.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.600]   And I think that limited view actually
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.360]   cuts off all the opportunities for me,
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.160]   because I don't even know what to look for.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.000]   So can you help us understand, first of all,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.960]   what are the key responsibilities and challenges
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.600]   you face as a product manager?
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.840]   And can you help us understand maybe the breadth of the field?
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.560]   Yeah, I think every company has their own definition
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.800]   of what a product manager is.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.280]   Historically for me, and a lot of the companies I've been at,
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:21.240]   has positioned it more as you are a mini GM, general manager
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.080]   within your domain of portfolio of products that you own,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.800]   and do whatever it takes to make it successful.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.000]   So I think that definitely is something that happens often.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   But you get into fields that are more like technical product
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.240]   manager, where you kind of need that engineering background,
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.320]   engine features.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:49.520]   But I would say the overall general definition
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.240]   of what product management should be
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.840]   is understanding the marketplace,
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.360]   understanding the market opportunity,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.000]   knowing who your competitors are,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.640]   figuring out a strategy that allows your company
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.560]   to enter the market and be successful at it.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.480]   But more than anything, is balancing the business aspects,
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.200]   but also embracing the user experience,
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.920]   and really putting yourself in the shoes of the user,
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.120]   or understanding data that helps you drive your product
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.080]   features and capabilities to delivering something that
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.000]   is delightful, that people love to use,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.200]   and want to use it every single day,
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.240]   and become obsessed over your product.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   That's essentially what product managers should be doing,
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.520]   in addition to writing product requirements documents,
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.120]   working with engineering teams, and program management teams
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.120]   to execute and deliver.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.120]   I mean, it isn't for the faint hearted,
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.240]   I got to say, because there's a lot of stuff happening
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.760]   at the same time all the time.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.360]   But you're never going to be bored.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.360]   I can promise you that.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.520]   Yeah, that's such a good point.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.880]   And actually, I really appreciate
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.480]   that walkthrough and breakdown, because it
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   helps me understand, there's some things that you said there
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.760]   that I feel really comfortable with.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.000]   And there's some things that might be a little foreign
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.800]   to me, right?
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.960]   And there's an aspect of it where
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.840]   I can probably bring some of that with me,
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.280]   and somebody can learn on the job.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.600]   I think the areas of things are like,
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.160]   how do you forecast or project opportunity,
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.400]   or forecast revenue or growth based on a feature
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.440]   that you create?
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.280]   How do you get that down to a science?
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.240]   If I'm going to add a feature to a product,
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.200]   how do I project that the return on that investment
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.320]   of development would yield x return for a company?
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.520]   How do you think about that?
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.120]   Yeah, it's definitely not easy.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:52.800]   I haven't seen any company, honestly, be successful at it.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.840]   I've had some struggles with forecasting
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.560]   as good as the team is.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.240]   There are always so many forces in place
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.560]   that you just can't predict, whether it's
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.280]   the economy or a competitor launches something better.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.360]   So from a forecasting standpoint,
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.080]   there are multiple ways of looking at it.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.360]   There is the bottoms up of what customers have agreed
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.400]   to buy such and such product.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.360]   Maybe it's an existing product that you're refreshing
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.960]   or a new product that you're entering.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.720]   So your sales team needs to determine
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.240]   what they think they can do.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.640]   Or you can also look at if you're a completely new company
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.560]   starting out of sizing the market,
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.120]   what is the total addressable market?
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.040]   And what do you think you can do based on that slice of pie
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.040]   that you're aiming for and trying to compute
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.400]   what your potential opportunity is within that market space?
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.960]   So forecasting, I say, is one of the hardest things.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.600]   And I don't think any company has truly perfected it
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.320]   from what I've seen.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.280]   Would you say your business school experience,
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.480]   obviously that helps with a lot of things
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.800]   you just talked about here, is in what areas
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   do you feel like that really contributed
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.240]   to your current success versus what aspects of product
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.120]   marketing can you succeed without having
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.280]   had that education?
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.960]   I contribute a lot of my introduction
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.840]   to product management due to the MBA
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:32.160]   because, honestly, coming out as a computer science major,
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.920]   you know nothing about marketing.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.560]   You barely scratch the surface on emotional intelligence,
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.200]   any of that.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.320]   Finance, looking at financial statements,
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.240]   things like that for the very first time.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.880]   Yeah, we're really good at math.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.480]   But do you know how to look at a financial statement
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:56.360]   or control cash flow, things like that?
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.920]   Those are all skills that you learn
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.680]   going through an MBA program.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.000]   And it gives you a taste of everything
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.920]   a product manager touches, which I think
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.760]   was the best crash course for me because I fell in love
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.360]   with marketing the moment I took my first marketing class.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.840]   And unfortunately, that didn't happen
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.160]   until I was going through for my MBA.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.600]   And then I learned about what it takes
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.160]   to motivate people from a management standpoint.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.800]   So again, you're going to be working cross-functionally.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.760]   How do you get your engineering team, program management team,
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.120]   your sales team to all want to put in their energy and time
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.400]   into making your product successful?
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.000]   Thinking about finance, how to run a breakeven point.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.400]   I didn't really learn that until later on from a sizing
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.000]   standpoint of all the money we're
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.560]   spending to develop products.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.360]   So these things are so valuable.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.200]   And they were tools that I gained, again,
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.120]   not being experts at, but at least getting a flavor of it
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.200]   so that when it does happen in the job,
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.600]   I'm like, I've seen that before.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.760]   It's not foreign to me.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.760]   I think I can handle this is the type of attitude
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.520]   I come into it.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.600]   Yeah, that's really good.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.400]   It actually kind of makes me think of,
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.160]   like you mentioned before, it's essentially
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.800]   like you're owning your own company, end to end.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.760]   And it reminds me of my brother, who is a dentist.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.400]   And he wanted to start his own practice.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.120]   And as a dentist, you're focused on one discipline.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.320]   But learning how to build a business
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.320]   requires exercising of muscles that he didn't even
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.240]   know existed.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.880]   And for him, he had to learn it on the job.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.200]   It was kind of painful, like people management,
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.520]   the financial aspect of stuff.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.520]   So I think you're right.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.560]   I think going into product management,
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.760]   it is probably good for anyone considering this field
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.920]   to do the due diligence of what it actually
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.120]   means to own a full product, end to end,
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.920]   and uncover those areas of study.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.640]   And to your point, you can either go through an MBA,
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.120]   or if people don't have the financial means to do that,
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.800]   there's a lot of content available out there,
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.880]   resources available for you to do that.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.520]   Kevin, I'm kind of wondering, as you're looking at--
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.160]   because we're talking about forecasting
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.000]   and doing competitive, right?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.400]   There's always going to be a long list of stuff
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.640]   that you want to develop.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.000]   It could be a reaction to a new feature or service
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.840]   that a competitor announced.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.720]   It could be a reaction to maybe something
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.280]   that your senior executive stakeholders are focused on
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.600]   and the roadmap they develop.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.960]   And then there's probably roadmaps
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.640]   informed by customers, right?
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.400]   Or by the sales team or technical sales.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:40.520]   How do you go about prioritizing which ones to do first?
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.400]   Man, that is a really tough question.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.240]   I think some of that comes with experience.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:55.280]   And in those situations, kind of focus on the user.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.840]   Because if I develop a product that the user absolutely loves,
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.600]   everything else you describe kind of falls into place.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:09.800]   That isn't easy, though, because if you're
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.200]   working in tech, tech changes so quickly.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.000]   How do you maintain and stay ahead of things?
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.880]   It's not easy.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.360]   And one of the things I've--
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.080]   I think one of the best lessons I've ever
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.080]   learned in product management-- and I
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.320]   see this failure often with product managers--
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.200]   is this desire to launch because they
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.000]   have been so emotionally invested in a product
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.120]   that they can't let go when it's time to kill a project.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:46.000]   I've-- more than anyone, I've been guilty of that.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.080]   But there was an instance where we were developing
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.000]   a new set of headphones.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.280]   And we just couldn't get the ergonomics perfect.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.920]   We couldn't get the curvature of the style and design
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.600]   that we wanted.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.320]   And we were in development for a year.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.280]   And at the time, I wanted to push forward.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.480]   And my boss asked me, do you still
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.640]   love it as much as we did the first day
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.720]   when we conceived of this idea and the design and everything?
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.960]   And I-- there was a lot of soul searching.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.320]   And I said, I don't anymore.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.440]   And she said, yes, because if you don't love it,
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.760]   think about the ramifications of bringing a product to market
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.720]   where you don't love anymore, and you're just
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.320]   the grind of delivering.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.360]   The customer probably won't love it as much as you do.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.440]   And then we're going to buy inventory.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.520]   It's going to sit--
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.960]   it's going to tie up cash flow.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.520]   If it doesn't sell because it's whatever,
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.640]   like many, many months past due, so now it's
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.640]   a little bit outdated, then we're
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.920]   going to have to slash our cost, which
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.640]   means that we're going to take a hit on margins
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.040]   and profitability, which then ties up cash flow
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.680]   to do other things, right?
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.880]   If you were to bet on other projects,
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   wouldn't that be a better use of your cash flow?
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.000]   So that was a really good lesson.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.760]   And funny enough, I think it was about three or six months
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.040]   later, she asked me, hey, do you remember that project?
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.280]   And I was like, yeah, it was the best decision we ever made.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.000]   And we never looked back.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.880]   I think those are some of the hard lessons
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.000]   that product managers need to learn,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.560]   because it's like giving birth to a baby.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.720]   You've been coddling it for so long.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:42.080]   And it's hard to let go, but sometimes you just have to.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.560]   But when you do, you're able to move on and have clarity again
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.520]   as to what you should be doing, what
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.520]   you know can be more successful.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.600]   It's easy to say this.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.360]   It is really hard to actually execute on it.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.520]   And I hope all those product managers out there
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:07.240]   are listening intently, because the ramifications of not letting
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.160]   go can be detrimental to your business.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.240]   Yeah, that's such a good point.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.280]   And I've actually never thought about that way.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.480]   And it makes me actually wonder.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.000]   So I'm going to use marketing as an example,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.880]   but I would love to see the product equivalent of this.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.400]   There are times where, let's say we're running a campaign,
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.920]   or we are trying to promote a specific report or asset,
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.480]   and after staring at the same thing for six months,
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.680]   even though it started at a place where we're really
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.720]   passionate about it and the customers love it, for example,
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.160]   we get kind of almost lazy in taking it for granted.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.040]   In some cases, kind of getting tired of it,
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.600]   whereas our customers are probably
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.800]   seeing it for the first time.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.320]   So they're excited about it, but our freshness
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.440]   is gone.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.640]   And I'm kind of wondering, when you are looking at a product,
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.720]   especially a product that's very mature, let's say,
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.600]   how do you ever run into a hurdle
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.440]   where you have to maybe reinvigorate your passion?
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.200]   And let's say, for instance, for example, a solution here
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.120]   is not to pull the record and bail out and find
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:13.920]   another product.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.720]   Let's say you need to stay within the product
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.160]   to continue to be successful.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.280]   How do you kind of re-engage and rediscover
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.400]   the passion if you've been doing the same thing
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.560]   for, let's say, 10 to 15 years?
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:30.640]   So first off, maybe a little bit about my personality.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.880]   I wake up every morning with that passion.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.440]   It's never lost.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.400]   But passion for a project that's kind of just dragging,
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.240]   I could see that.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.640]   Yeah, I think it comes down to what your mission is
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.360]   from the get-go.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:22:00.040]   A mission that you and your team have a strong passion for.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.480]   With that, the drive shouldn't be gone,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.760]   even if your customers are seeing it for the first time
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.880]   and you guys have been working on it for some time.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.080]   But think about how to continue to innovate.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.880]   Think about how to leapfrog the market.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.080]   Think about how to take advantage of maybe the head
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.320]   start that you've got if customers are loving it
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.600]   and everyone's seeing it for the first time.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.800]   How do you continue to push that envelope so that number two
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.960]   and number three are so far behind where you guys are?
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.240]   I see that quite a bit with a lot of the Apple stuff
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.160]   that's launching with their earphones.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.600]   When they launched the AirPods, so far ahead of everyone else
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:49.040]   in terms of the quality and getting audio to hit both ears
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.440]   and for everyone else to catch up and getting that form factor
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.160]   very tiny and small at that performance that they got
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.200]   with the noise cancellation.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.040]   I mean, they're leaps and bounds ahead of everyone.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.920]   And even with the Apple Watch, people trying to catch up,
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.320]   they're so far ahead.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.400]   If you do have that lead, and yeah, it
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.960]   might feel a little stale because it's
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.920]   something you've been working on for some time,
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.200]   but go back to the mission that you're focused on.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.400]   Think about the mission that you and your team
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.920]   are dedicated to and use that as your North Star
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.960]   versus this is just one project that's kind of dragging.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.000]   I love that.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.920]   And I think if you tie that with something
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.960]   you said earlier, which is focused on the customer,
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.200]   I think that's where you can derive a lot of innovation
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.000]   because customer needs are always changing.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.960]   And again, if you're trying to deliver the best
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.920]   experience for a customer and they're
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.120]   evolving with age groups as well,
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.840]   it shouldn't ever be boring.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.400]   Your desire to stay ahead is critical.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.080]   And actually, I'm kind of even wondering,
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:51.960]   how do you go about looking at potential of a feature
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.880]   or product or is a category that may not exist yet?
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.840]   And you probably have all of these pie-in-the-sky ideas.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.280]   How do you go grab maybe the one that you feel like, hey,
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.880]   this might actually be something based
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.560]   on what you're seeing from industry trends
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.520]   or technology trends.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.800]   Can you give some examples of that or even one?
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.000]   In those situations, I think it's
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.480]   really good to test with your people within your circle
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.480]   and gauge, is there some level of excitement
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.440]   behind something that's never been seen before?
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:34.880]   An example is I do some of my own personal projects
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.560]   and I was one of the first to develop a respirator
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.040]   mask for kids.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.440]   And it's never been seen before and it was a super hard
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.760]   challenge because there was nothing to reference.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.400]   But knowing that there was a need for it
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.800]   and a desire for it with all the wildfire smoke
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.360]   we get here in California, it was something
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.280]   that I was testing with a lot of parents
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.400]   to see and gauge, is this something
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.560]   they would be interested in?
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.400]   And then obviously working closely with kids
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.560]   to see if this is something that they would wear,
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.840]   if it's going to help protect them.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:17.600]   And it's making sure that you're keeping them involved.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.760]   I had, again, hustling to get things through.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:27.760]   I created a small Facebook group with close moms and dads
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.760]   that are friends of mine and making sure
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.640]   that they're very open and honest about their feedback.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.560]   So as I went through the development cycle,
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.720]   it was great to get their feedback as to whether the cost
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:45.440]   was too high, if I addressed their protection concerns,
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.120]   and then obviously making sure that the kids were involved
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.200]   in testing and trying it out.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.720]   So things that have never been done before
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.680]   are, I think, one of the most challenging
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.640]   because there's nothing to reference against and learn
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.000]   from where their pitfalls are.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.080]   Obviously, there were masks out there,
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.400]   but those things weren't even in the same playing field
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.920]   as what we were looking to develop.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.640]   Yeah, and just for everyone viewing,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.800]   you're referring to Flowmask.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.280]   Is that right?
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.240]   No, absolutely.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.320]   Yeah, and everyone, there's going to be--
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.560]   actually, Kevin and I are going to do a separate video
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.320]   going specifically into Flowmask.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.000]   I think it's a really interesting study
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.440]   on taking a product from conception to market,
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.600]   starting a new business from the ground up,
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.000]   and being award winning.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.280]   And he's very-- you're not touting your own horn here,
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.840]   but I'll give you all the credibility.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.560]   Shout out there.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.360]   So make sure you guys subscribe to this
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.800]   because you'll want to see that video when it comes out.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.000]   There's going to be a lot to be learned because I'm actually
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.720]   even interested in even things like branding and naming
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.000]   of the product, as well as, again,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.280]   you just mentioned now, getting feedback and research
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.880]   with your customers.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.160]   So that's fantastic.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.280]   I can't wait to get there.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.680]   Can we just pivot a little bit?
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.480]   Earlier, we had talked about skills and aptitudes
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.400]   that you've experienced on the job.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.280]   Can you maybe outline, when you're
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.000]   looking to hire someone to be a product manager on your team,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.560]   from a entry level all the way up to senior?
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.440]   What hard or soft skills are you looking for?
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.480]   You mentioned attitude earlier, the hustle and entrepreneurial.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.680]   But is there anything else you're looking for?
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.000]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.080]   I think it's really important to make sure
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.160]   that person has interest in the category
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.600]   that you're working on.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.160]   If there is no passion, then it's going to be a challenge.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.400]   So that's number one.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.480]   Number two would be, do they have
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.600]   that entrepreneurial spirit?
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   Do they think like an entrepreneur?
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.720]   Because an entrepreneur will find any crack
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:49.240]   to capitalize on and take advantage of to be successful.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:54.920]   I oftentimes ask, share a product that you love and why.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.640]   And if they're going about the approach methodically,
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.120]   the way a product manager would, then
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.520]   I can see that they've got some of that skill set and sense
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.880]   in it.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.400]   I think one of the other challenges
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.680]   I try to look for is someone with grit.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.880]   Because of every project I've ever developed,
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.640]   and I've done over 100 hardware projects
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.320]   over the last 20 years, that last 5%
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.840]   of getting it to ship and launched in the marketplace
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.760]   is probably harder than the 95% it took to get there.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.880]   Can you tell us about that?
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.200]   Yeah, tell us more about that.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.720]   Yeah, the finishing touches, making sure
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.400]   that you met every qualification and expectation
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.920]   that you had originally when you developed it.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.200]   Can you do it at scale to manufacture at high volumes?
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:53.360]   Can you do it in a way where the cost structure is feasible
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.920]   so you're getting the proper yield rate
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.840]   that you're aiming for?
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.960]   All these things have to come into place.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.360]   And just making sure that, again, at the end,
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.880]   do you still love it from the day
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.920]   you originally conceived of it?
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:12.760]   And making sure that that sense of feeling is still there.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.240]   And making sure that you're able to get it across the finish
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.440]   line so that you can bring it to the world
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.120]   and let everyone else experience what
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.800]   you've been working on for the last all-plus months.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.400]   So how do you distinguish yourself,
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.320]   whether it's on a resume or cover letter?
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.160]   Because, again, there's going to be a lot of resumes
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.240]   that look the same, right?
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.080]   Because you have a job description.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.280]   You try to match that, right?
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.720]   But how do you set yourself apart
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.280]   to even get that first interview with you?
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.120]   That's a really good question.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.920]   Obviously, the recruiters have to do
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.960]   a lot of digging ahead of time.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.840]   But I share kind of an overview of what
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.480]   I'm looking for when we do talk about roles.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.440]   And everything I just described to you
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.680]   are things I'm looking for.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.520]   It's less about the school.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.320]   But it's more about the attitude.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.120]   It's more about the right level of experience
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.960]   that we're looking for in terms of if it's
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.880]   going to be more of a technical role, where
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.360]   they do need to have some level of technical knowledge.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.880]   I think that's going to be important.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.920]   Like, you can't just jump into hardware
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.840]   without knowing how products are made.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.720]   I think that's going to be really challenging.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.000]   Unless you're going to come in as an associate product
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.800]   manager, yeah, it totally makes sense.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.000]   But then again, I go to, well, have you
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.120]   managed a business before?
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.960]   Do you have some of those skills?
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.560]   Obviously, during the interview, it'll
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.920]   be really important to see how strong
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.760]   is their emotional intelligence in solving
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.520]   some of these problems, potential conflicts
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.800]   with colleagues and your cross-functional teams.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.680]   That is so critical to success as a product manager.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.520]   But specifically on the resume, that's a tough one.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.280]   It's going to be making sure that--
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:06.520]   I guess I look more for things that show me that you've
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.600]   been running a business.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.880]   I feel like if you've been doing that,
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.400]   you can figure everything else out.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.880]   And kind of going back to the very first question
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.480]   you asked of the fact that you don't
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.320]   feel like your background is geared
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.960]   towards product management, I have never
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.000]   met product managers with the exact same background.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.920]   It's not like a computer science programmer that
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.120]   had a computer science degree.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.120]   Product managers come from all walks of life.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.520]   And I think that's one of the beauties of the role
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:42.240]   is that you can have people coming from biology or QA,
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.080]   people who come from customer support.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.000]   I've seen people from all walks of life
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.200]   and all prior job experiences step right into the role
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.600]   and be successful because it's the little bits of experience
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.360]   they brought from their previous job that adds on
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.440]   to what product management is.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.600]   And that's why I love product management so much.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.680]   That's a great response.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.480]   And I think you called out a lot of things
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.600]   that are really important.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.000]   I think construction of your resume
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   that allows you to even tell a story is really important.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.400]   And you might think, oh, well, I'm
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.440]   limited to bullet points.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.920]   Well, what you share those bullet points
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:24.600]   or the data you unveiled to tell the story in itself
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.400]   illustrates your level of confidence or capability there.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.040]   And so I would definitely spend some time looking at that.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.400]   Because again, to your point, you
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.440]   got to somehow tell the story without telling the story.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.720]   Unlike a cover letter, right?
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.840]   And maybe the cover letter or your portfolio
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.640]   is where you can, again, dive a little deeper into that.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.920]   So I just got one more question for you, Kevin.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.120]   For someone who's a current practitioner as a PM,
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.640]   what does growth opportunity look like to them?
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.040]   You've evolved from product management
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.840]   to program management at Google.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.840]   What's the potential of a product manager?
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:01.840]   I think oftentimes, product managers
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.880]   end up spinning off and starting their own thing.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.800]   They're so well-rounded in terms of knowing
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.760]   how to work with different groups
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.840]   and knowing how to identify market opportunities.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.880]   Oftentimes, I've seen a lot of product managers
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.280]   kind of start their own business.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.000]   But growth opportunities, it's massive.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.360]   Because you're learning to be a mini-CEO within your company
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.720]   and learning all the skill sets that
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.240]   are required to drive a business to success.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.600]   So whether you want to stay in that same industry
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:43.360]   or if you want to transition out to another company that
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.840]   does something that you can bring your skill set to
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.920]   and help them grow that business,
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:56.160]   I almost feel like you have this core set of skills that
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.400]   allow you to make businesses successful.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.960]   Doesn't matter what business it is.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.720]   And you can just parachute that person in,
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.600]   and they'll figure out how to make that business thrive.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.680]   So I definitely see that as being part of it.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.640]   But it's a skill set that is constantly evolving.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:18.240]   And it's never ending in terms of the knowledge base
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.040]   that you can gain.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.720]   So even for myself, I continue to obsess over the user
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.080]   experience and think about, what can I do better for the user?
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.160]   How can I reduce the number of steps
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:33.080]   it takes to maybe, say, set up a peripheral?
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.560]   Those little things, all the way to when I was at Logitech,
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.440]   we had the customer support number
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.360]   at the very back of the user manual.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.800]   And it's like, why is it back there and not at the front?
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.320]   Little things like that.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.800]   Thinking differently, I think, is a pretty big thing.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.400]   And that's another thing about product management
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.640]   is that you're allowed to have this massive creative space
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.280]   to push the envelope.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.760]   And you're wearing the hat that gives you that authority
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.320]   as well.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.120]   But obviously, you want to make sure everyone else is
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.200]   willing to join you for the ride.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.520]   Well, Kevin, this was great.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.320]   And I just want to thank you for your time.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.360]   There's so much that we learned from you today.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.080]   And I think for people who are considering this
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.120]   as a new field or current practitioners,
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.240]   there's a lot of really good advice you gave there.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.040]   So I just want to thank you for your time.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.680]   Just to remind everybody, Flowmask
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.960]   is definitely something we want to talk about in depth.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.520]   You'll want to stick around for that.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.440]   And so make sure you like, subscribe,
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.200]   and hit the notification bell, so you'll
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.120]   be notified when that's available.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.320]   Thanks a lot, Kevin.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.080]   Thanks, Sam.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:37.760]   Appreciate it.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.240]   Thank you.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.640]   Oh, one more question, Kevin.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.640]   If you're open to it, how can people find you?
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.960]   How can they find their way to Flowmask or anything else?
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.000]   Yeah, if you guys want to check out Flowmask,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.720]   you can visit our website at f-l-o-m-a-s-k dot com.

[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.480]   Thanks a lot, Kevin.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.280]   Yep, thanks, too.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.840]   See you later.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.900]   you
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:24.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
