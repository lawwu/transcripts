[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   We're back with Francis Chan.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.920]   He joins us from San Francisco.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.240]   Francis and his wife Lisa are the authors of the new book, You and Me Forever, Marriage
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.080]   in Light of Eternity.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.360]   And in the book you write, Francis, "If you'd rather watch your kids grow up than see the
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.880]   face of your Savior today, you don't grasp the beauty of God."
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.480]   And on the same page you write this, "I'd bet that at least 95% of American Christians
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.080]   would choose not to leave their families today if they were given the choice to be with Jesus
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.360]   instead."
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.520]   Those sentences have some Philippians 121 punch to them, but I get the impression that
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.360]   you and Lisa and your five kids enjoy a pretty sweet relationship.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.960]   I mean, how is your family more healthy the more Jesus takes center stage in your family?
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.000]   Yeah, actually I have six kids.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.200]   My seventh is on the way in a couple weeks.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.880]   So it's busy, you know, and we have other people living with us as well.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.120]   And I love being with my kids.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.800]   They are so fun.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.880]   I mean, so much laughter, just great.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.800]   But you know, the more I spend time with Jesus, first of all, the more my wife and kids like
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.800]   me.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.800]   Okay?
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.880]   And my wife will tell me, "Gosh, why don't you go read some more?"
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.720]   You know, it's those periods when she knows I've had my time with the Lord.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.960]   It's just, I'm more of a delight, I guess, to be, like, I don't notice when I turn, but
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.440]   I guess they do.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   The other thing about it is that the more I pray to God and I see answers to those prayers,
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.360]   the more my kids see that, "Wow, God listens to Dad," and they want the same thing for
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.800]   their lives.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.920]   It's not just about their current happiness.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.940]   And my time with the Lord isn't just so we can have a healthy family, because honestly,
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.680]   if my connection with the Lord even made our family dynamics more difficult or trying,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.120]   it would still be worth it.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.800]   Because my goal, my greatest desire is that when my kids leave the family, leave the home,
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.640]   that they would love Him deeply.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.080]   So I need them to experience God when they're with me.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.640]   I need to see them experience the answers of prayers so that they pray more.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.200]   Because once my kids move out, yeah, it would be tough if, you know, they were interviewed
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.520]   and said, "Oh, yeah, I had a tough family.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.040]   I don't really like hanging out with them," or, "I don't really like my dad that much."
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   Like, of course, that would break my heart.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.920]   But I could deal with that.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.880]   What would be unbearable is if they didn't love Jesus.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.440]   Like, okay, they didn't like our family, they didn't like that prayer, okay, they struggle
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.000]   with that, but they're in love with the Lord.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.440]   Okay, okay, I'll take that.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.560]   But I think about eternity, like the thought of any of my children not being there, that's
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.640]   unbearable to me.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.380]   That's devastating to me.
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.520]   And so, yes, it would be painful if my kids said I didn't enjoy my childhood.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.920]   Yeah, but I'll get over that.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.820]   There's something so much bigger.
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.240]   They need to know Jesus.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.120]   I want them to be with me in all of eternity.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.120]   They need to love Him.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.800]   And so I think one of the things I mentioned in the book is what are you after?
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.120]   Like do you want them to love you more than you want them to love Jesus?
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.280]   Obviously I want both.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.980]   But if I'm going to choose one or the other, it's always going to be Jesus.
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.040]   That is eternity focus counsel, which marks every page of your new book.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.040]   So thank you, Francis.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   I appreciate that.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.760]   And speaking of family, you have five daughters.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.640]   And so what is Francis Chan looking for when a suitor begins getting serious?
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.000]   I want to ask you that tomorrow.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
