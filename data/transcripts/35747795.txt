[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.860]   Welcome, friends, to this episode of the Everyday Educator Podcast.
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:13.380]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey, and I'm excited to spend some time with you today as we encourage
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.000]   one another, learn together, and ponder the delights and challenges that make homeschooling
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.580]   the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.840]   Whether you're just considering this homeschooling possibility or deep into the daily delight
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.000]   of family learning, I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.560]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome, you'll find even closer support
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.700]   in a local CC community.
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:51.620]   So go to classicalconversations.com and find a community near you today.
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.060]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to welcome you to this episode of Everyday Educators, because
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.740]   we're going to talk about one of my very favorite things, books.
[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.960]   And I suspect books are near and dear to your heart and to your family's heart and to your
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.440]   family's pursuit of learning.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.660]   And I've got two good friends with me today who also love books.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.640]   I've got Tim Knotts here.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.560]   Tim, welcome.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.440]   Hey, Lisa.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.460]   Good to be with you.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.700]   Tim is the Director of Challenge Development with CCMM.
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.520]   And Jennifer Courtney, who is our Chief Academic Officer at CCMM, is here too.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.840]   Jennifer, thanks for coming.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.360]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.840]   You know I like talking about books.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.400]   I know.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.320]   And y'all are some of my favorite people to talk about books with, because if I start to
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.500]   drool or my eyes start to shine, you don't think I'm weird at all.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.780]   So that's perfect.
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.880]   In fact, I told somebody the other day, if Jennifer Courtney has a superpower, it has to
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.680]   do with books.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.860]   And I can imagine you wearing a big cape that says, Keeper of the Books.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.320]   And I've always aspired to be that with you.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.200]   I love talking to you about your library and about the libraries that we each are building
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.380]   in our homes for our kids and grandchildren and neighbors.
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:21.400]   And I want you to tell me why that idea of being a keeper of the books is so inspirational
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.200]   for you.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.280]   Yeah, so weirdly, I have always wanted to be keeper of the books.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.200]   And the reason I said weirdly is because when I was very young, I actually turned my one bookshelf
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.560]   in my room into a library and was checking out books to our neighbors.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.320]   Oh my gosh, I did that too!
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   I know.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:52.840]   So as you know, I'm on a quest to build a personal library in my house.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.080]   Yes, yes.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.500]   Blogging books and shelving books and checking them out to homeschoolers.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.020]   But the reason that it's this idea of keepers of the books is so important in classical conversations
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:12.100]   is because as classical Christian educators, we want to preserve the best books from that
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.600]   tradition.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.760]   And given our civilizational moment that we're in, some of them might give.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.100]   And so we started this idea really with a few of our challenge titles and also with our
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.460]   echoes books that we wanted to start, that we as classical conversations multimedia wanted
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:40.480]   to be on the front lines of preserving these texts for families to share across the generations.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.000]   You know, I just love that.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.220]   It makes me sort of proud to be in on that mission.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:58.640]   I love the idea of preserving the good old classical books and the good authors of the past and the
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:09.420]   good stories of the past that are far too often missing from bookshelves in some of our libraries
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.960]   even.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.780]   And it makes me really sad.
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.460]   Tim, does your family still go to the library looking for classical education or classical novels,
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.340]   books, good books?
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.600]   We do.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.800]   Our local librarians know us well and often roll their eyes when my children walk away
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.200]   with a stack of 50 books.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.020]   I understand.
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.600]   But I think it's very gracious that the two of you had lending libraries as children because
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.820]   I was probably not so much a keeper of the books as a hoarder of the books.
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.620]   I wanted them all for myself and didn't like to let anyone take them away.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.020]   That is so funny.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:56.460]   I know there were books that I was very loathe to lend and I think some bad experiences with
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.200]   books that I loved that didn't come back to me played into that.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.400]   But I see what you're saying, where you're coming from, Jennifer, that we want to be sure
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.560]   that people that we know and love and people that live around us have access to some of these
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.480]   books and we don't want them to be lost and we do want them to be available.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:24.120]   So I like thinking that all of us, all of our listeners and all of us here can become
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.220]   keepers of the books and that reading is really important.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.780]   I want to ask both of you, I know because I've talked to you before and you're my friends,
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.300]   I know that you have always been big readers with your own children.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:48.040]   Let me ask you, Jennifer, why has reading with your kids always been so very important to
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.300]   you?
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.140]   I want us to, between the three of us, list as many good reasons and purposes and benefits
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.240]   of reading with our kids as we can.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.380]   So what are some of the reasons reading was so very important to you?
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.820]   Yeah, so we, in my home, we started reading aloud very early, pretty much when the kids
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.740]   were in the womb.
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:16.300]   And when we made it a formal part of our home education day, if you want to say it that way,
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:23.340]   our homeschool day, was number one, because I wanted to associate, I wanted my children to
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:31.240]   associate the reading of good books, scripture, histories, myths, novels that might be serious
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.080]   or might be, you know, roll on the floor laughing.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.060]   I wanted them to associate all of that with the joy of being in our family together.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:49.160]   And you get to know their, you're both getting to know who your kids are by the way they respond
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.340]   to the stories and you're also getting to shape their character by discussing the decisions
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:00.560]   that characters made or the mistakes that they made and making connections to our own lives.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:08.440]   So to me, that was the most important hour of our day was, was having those conversations
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.640]   and just creating a lovely, memorable shared culture together.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.620]   Yeah, I love that shared culture.
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.040]   We might chase that rabbit a little bit more.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.600]   Tim, why did you and Cynthia find reading with your kids so very important?
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:29.380]   I would say for us, it actually wasn't a choice that we made.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.680]   It was something that we inherited.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.420]   Both of us had parents who read extensively to us.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:42.120]   And so for us, it was just what we do with our children, just as our parents did with us.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.800]   It's only been as they've gotten older that we had to be more deliberate in making that choice
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.820]   to say this is still valuable and important enough to set aside time as a family to do it,
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.020]   even when everybody's busy.
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.600]   Yeah, that's really true.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:05.180]   It does become more of a choice when there are more choices from which to choose.
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.920]   You're right.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.400]   You're right.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:15.920]   I think for me, I, as a little girl, loved the world that I could enter through books.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:22.620]   And I just, I loved all the places I could visit, all the people I could meet, all the situations
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.780]   I could try out without danger or without having to stay there.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.040]   And it was just, it became the palace of my imagination.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.300]   And it was a rich and wonderful place to me as a little girl.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.740]   And I think, and we also started reading to our girls in the womb.
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:47.800]   And, and, and I remember reading to them when they were really, really little, just constantly,
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.960]   just if they came through the house, if I was walking through the house and they said,
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.400]   read me this book, I would just sit down and read with them because I wanted them to have
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.000]   a palace of imagination too.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.040]   And I wanted them to go places and see things that I probably might not be able to introduce
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:14.040]   them to face to face, but in their imagination, they could come close to knowing.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.600]   So for me, reading aloud was magic.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:25.020]   And then we read aloud for a lot of the same reasons that you mentioned, Jennifer, it was
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:32.640]   important to me to introduce them to choices they might make good and bad and let them learn
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:42.440]   from other people's mistakes in literature or, or come in contact with a, an interesting way
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:48.940]   to solve a problem that might not occur to them given their natural inclination, but that
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:55.540]   might seem like a viable choice to them if they had read about it in a book or seen it successfully
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.220]   practiced by somebody else.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.500]   So that learning that they did.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:06.300]   And I, you know, I remember knowing a lot of answers to weird trivia, not because I had ever
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:12.040]   studied this subject, but because it had been like background in some book I had read.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.540]   Like I have no idea why I know this weird fact, but it was must, must have been in some story
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.320]   I read one time.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.400]   And so I thought it was really cool to know all that stuff.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:27.740]   And I wanted to expose my daughters to a lot of ideas and a lot of interesting tidbits.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:37.340]   So what, what are some of the benefits that, you know, that your kids received from being
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.440]   read to Jennifer?
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:49.220]   Well, one thing is that, um, they developed, um, a good ear, um, for future writing.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:55.400]   And so Tim and I actually were talking about this just this morning that you can teach people
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:01.740]   techniques for writing, but the best way to prepare our students to be a good writer is
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:07.760]   to have them read lots and lots of different authors and develop a voice of their own.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:14.980]   And then the other thing I appreciated is that, um, after hours of, um, listening, they also
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.800]   were able to read aloud and therefore do it.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.480]   It's important.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.940]   You know, we've lost in some of our churches, we've lost a little practice of reading scripture
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.360]   aloud.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.640]   Um, and so it's important for us to read aloud together in community.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:35.480]   And once they have heard lots of reading aloud, they can also, um, share that gift with others.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.520]   And then the main benefit, those are sort of practical things, right?
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.000]   Yes.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.480]   Yes.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.080]   And learning to have a good ear.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:47.500]   But, um, the other, the other thing is, as I mentioned, it was just, um, character building
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:53.900]   because we could, um, we could look at those things and make those decisions.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:02.700]   And sometimes just even fellowship of laughing together over a funny scene or sometimes it
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.160]   would inspire them to want to do things.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:09.360]   I wasn't going to let them do like, like when Henry Huggins is riding in a bathtub through
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:09.740]   the streets.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.900]   Oh my gosh.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.820]   My son really wanted to do that.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.260]   Or he really wanted to be like Henry Huggins and go on the bus by himself.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.600]   Oh my word.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.420]   There were those moments too, where we had to look at visions and go, yeah, we're not doing
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:21.680]   that.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.820]   Yeah, my daughter wanted to live in a box car.
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.660]   I mean, she just really was convinced that we should move an old train car into the back
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.420]   of our property so she could live there.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.520]   And I was like, you know, that's not going to happen, right?
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.080]   Yes, we have that desire too.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.560]   And occasionally our read alouds would inspire them to want a pet that I was not going for.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.000]   Yes.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.800]   Raccoon or a catby daughter.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.860]   I can think of a few others.
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:45.940]   Yes.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.720]   Yes.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.140]   That is so funny.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.180]   That is so funny.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:56.940]   Okay, Tim, what benefits practical and just fun did you see from reading aloud with your
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.200]   kids in all their ages?
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:06.220]   So one of my favorite Andrew Kern quotes is that the point of education is to get all the
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:06.540]   jokes.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.240]   Oh, yes.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.820]   And by reading widely, you get more jokes.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:19.260]   You get it when someone makes that slant wise reference to something else.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.020]   And especially when they do it tongue in cheek or a little bit satirically.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:30.300]   And so there's definitely been times where my kids are reading something and whether there's
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:37.360]   a true illusion or whether it's just a trope or something, they recognize it and say, oh,
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.040]   this is like in that other book.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:46.640]   And so I love to see their network growing within them.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.280]   Oh, that's a good picture.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:56.480]   And then sort of on the lighter side, you know, we have collected inside literary jokes as a
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:56.820]   family.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.620]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:03.980]   So there'll be things where we'll see something or hear something and one of us or another will
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:11.140]   turn and look at another and we'll both spout out the same line from some book or name from
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.920]   some book that we've read together and laugh about it because there's, you know, something
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.500]   that struck us at the same time.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:28.860]   So building that kind of closeness, number one, and number two, the basis for conversations
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:34.180]   to be able to reopen something and say, yeah, and do you remember how?
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.300]   Yes.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.200]   Yes.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.380]   That's really good.
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.060]   I love that.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:45.400]   Our family also has lots of inside literary jokes, things that touched our collective funny
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.640]   bone in the same way.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.360]   And even turns of phrases.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:56.780]   I mean, there are books that our family can quote in long passages that other people probably
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.280]   think were kind of strange for, but you're right.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:07.360]   It makes for a great camaraderie and a great shared memory is really good.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.600]   So how, Jennifer, you said you started reading to your kids in the womb.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:19.400]   How early do you advocate when people, when young parents talk to you guys at a practicum
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:27.280]   or something about, you know, reading aloud with your family or morning basket time or family
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:27.780]   time?
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.140]   How early do you begin reading aloud?
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.140]   I mean, do you, do you read aloud to toddlers?
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.860]   And what are some of the tips?
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.700]   What are your good tips for beginning well when your children are little?
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.180]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:50.140]   So one of the things that, um, I started my kids with is poetry because whether or not they
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:57.380]   understand all the words, they can be delighted by the sounds and, um, they can, they enjoy the
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:57.680]   rhythm.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.780]   And so that was one way that we started.
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:05.000]   And like the Knott's family, we started going to the library when the kids were very small,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:15.260]   um, you know, one and let them pick their own books and just keeping some short things that
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.260]   are lively and fun that have pictures or even wordless books where they can tell the story
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:26.560]   themselves, um, and then gradually, you know, working up their ability to listen.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:32.320]   So you read just a little longer and a little longer and a little longer, um, to help them
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.680]   develop the ability to attend.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:43.260]   And, um, so I do think it's very important to let them have some, some choices and some
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.460]   that you introduce, cause they're not always going to pick the best books.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:52.400]   Um, and the biggest tip is they're going to want you to read the same ones over and over
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.260]   and over again.
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.160]   Oh, okay.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:01.320]   That's an important pre-reading skill because before they can decode the words, they are memorizing
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.160]   them and that is to their development.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.300]   And so you cannot neglect the reading the same ones over and over again.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:14.800]   Even if it leads to your child saying, when you have skipped a page, that's not how it goes,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.960]   yes, yes, you will get caught, but then you can just revel in the fact that you did your
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.380]   job well and they have now memorized that book.
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.640]   That's really good.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.480]   I like that.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.460]   Um, I like beginning with poetry.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:35.840]   Um, I, we had some books of poetry that we would read, um, and sometimes we would take
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:42.420]   it places like the doctor's office or, um, another kind of waiting room somewhere that I knew we
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:49.540]   would be interrupted so that they would not clamor and dismay when the story got interrupted.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.920]   It was just little short things that we could do.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:56.120]   And those are easy things to do in the car and during transition times.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.160]   That's really good.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.080]   Tim, what did you do?
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:04.540]   Cause I know that, that some of your kids were little when others of your kids were older.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:09.500]   Or how did you read together, all together and keep the little ones entertained?
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:14.220]   Um, well, sometimes well, and sometimes not well.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:19.820]   I want you to tell those kinds of stories too, because we all have those moments where we saw
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.000]   it going differently and it didn't work out as well.
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:23.920]   For sure.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.720]   It's, it's never easy.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:32.800]   I think one of the things, uh, it actually is what Jennifer was just saying about not being
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.840]   afraid to read the same book over and over.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   When you, when you read the same book to your big kids that then you introduce to your little
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.960]   kids, the big kids know it.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.900]   And while they may kind of roll their eyes a little bit at it because it's quote unquote
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:58.040]   babyish, um, they have a relationship with that book and, uh, and though they may act out
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:01.320]   some disdainful things, they're not really all that disdainful about it.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.900]   They, they love to hear them again too.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:13.900]   Um, and, uh, so trying to find that balance of reading some, some things that are above the
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:19.860]   level of some of your kids so that they can hear that better, more beautiful language and
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:27.700]   encounter some bigger ideas, but also not neglecting the small things and letting those
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:33.300]   also still be precious, um, even with older kids and reminding them that though they're in a hurry
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.140]   to grow up, uh, that there actually isn't any great hurry to do that.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.580]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:44.280]   Somebody famous said that, you know, if a book is not worth reading when you're
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.260]   a grownup, it's probably not worth reading when you're a child, you know, that needs to
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:55.340]   be, it needs to be a good book that can, can meet your imagination, no matter how old you
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:55.660]   are.
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.920]   I love that.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.120]   That's good words.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:05.000]   Lisa, that one of my, um, expectations that was not met when I was training my kids to read
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.760]   stories is that probably like many of us, I had this idealized view that I would pull out
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.760]   the book and they would, you know, all gather around my skirts.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:19.780]   I mean, my jeans, then they would just hang on my every word and be entranced.
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.780]   And I had a boy first and he was a very active boy.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.980]   And I remember sitting on the driveway reading to him while he was riding a scooter around
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.260]   me.
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:34.220]   And then I had, but he was listening and I would ask him and he would tell me back the
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:34.520]   story.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.440]   So we kept up.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:41.820]   And I had a little girl who could sit still all day who could draw if you wanted her to,
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.500]   but was also perfectly content to sit there with her hands in her lap listening.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:52.560]   My third child, I look up one day and she is riding her tricycle in circles around my house
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.940]   and leaving a track in the carpet.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.500]   But she's also listening to the story.
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.960]   So I had to adjust my expectations a little bit.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:06.660]   I'm so glad that you brought that up because for lots of young moms, we have this idealized
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.840]   vision of what reading aloud is going to be the cozy time.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.540]   And it's not always a cozy time, but it can always be a fun time.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:21.540]   I have a little grandson and I read to him and sometimes he acts like he's all enthralled
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.280]   by the story.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:27.480]   And sometimes he acts like he's busy doing something else, even if he's asking me to read the story.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:35.340]   But I was at his house one day last week and he's running back and forth from his room to
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.620]   the living room, bringing toys and doing things.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.840]   And he's mumbling.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.700]   And I think he's talking to me at first.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.680]   And then I listen a little closer and he is reciting the last story.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:51.440]   As he runs back and forth, he is telling the story to himself as he's busy.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.040]   So moms, dads, don't be discouraged.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.780]   Your kids are probably listening, even if they look like they're not listening.
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:11.100]   I don't know about you guys, but at practicums, I often get asked about reading aloud to children
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.580]   who have already learned to read themselves.
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:20.720]   You know, do you still, do you keep reading aloud after your kids can read alone?
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.560]   Do they want you to?
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.880]   Do you need to?
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.140]   Do they like it?
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.320]   Do you?
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:32.280]   Tim, did you guys keep reading aloud after your kids could read for themselves?
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.060]   As often as I can.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:35.840]   Yes.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.260]   I love it.
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:43.680]   So we have our oldest is getting closer and closer to the end of her challenge three year
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.240]   right now.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:44.800]   Yes.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.660]   And our youngest is in her second tour of essentials.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:56.300]   And we are in the middle of reading Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey together right now.
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.380]   I read it to them at least a couple of nights a week.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.900]   We manage to find the time to get in some good reading out of that.
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:09.720]   And that's in addition to whatever else my wife is reading to them as part of their homeschool
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:09.980]   day.
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.680]   That is so good.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.640]   So you kept reading.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.360]   Why do you keep reading aloud?
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.040]   All of your kids now know how to read well on their own.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.440]   Why do you still do it?
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.380]   For all those reasons you said before?
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.640]   Yes.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.700]   For those reasons.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:32.160]   And also because I know that if I don't, then number one, it's hard to ever pick it back
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.020]   up to do it again.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:42.000]   And number two, we may read some of the same books because there are just good books that
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.960]   are part of what we will read as a family.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:50.040]   But it deprives us of the chance to be sitting there engaged with the same book at the same
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:50.660]   time.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.620]   Yes.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.540]   That's really good.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:24:02.840]   And, you know, there's also the truth that you may read something aloud to your children
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.620]   that one or more of them would never choose for themselves.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:14.460]   And so you are exposing them to another piece of literature and broadening their horizons
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.700]   in a way that they might not strike out for on their own.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.800]   Jennifer, you kept reading aloud.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:26.720]   I know you've got kids that are widely different in age from Ben to Mia also.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.340]   So there was a wide.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:33.000]   So you were reading aloud to Mia when Ben and Abby were well able to read to themselves.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.700]   Did you just keep reading aloud to everybody anyway?
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:43.100]   We did, depending on what year they were in challenge and what their personal schedules
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.380]   are.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:49.220]   Sometimes that reading got shorter, which is one of the reasons that I really liked pulling
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.160]   together the stories that are in the Echoes books.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:56.800]   Because if I could grab only, you know, 20 minutes in the morning or 30 minutes, at least
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   we were all still having that time together.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.300]   And everyone of all ages could benefit from each other's insights.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.660]   Oh, that's good.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.020]   We occasionally make time to do longer novels still.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.900]   But of course, the challenge kids were reading a lot of their own.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.120]   So usually we opted for shorter things.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:19.980]   And there is some great advice in Jim Trulise's read aloud handbook for reading kids.
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:24.700]   And some of the examples he gives are quite fun because he would read to them while they
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.500]   were doing the dishes.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.160]   Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.760]   You can.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.280]   I'm pastoring chores is a good way to tackle a child read aloud.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.280]   Uh-huh.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.700]   That's really good.
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.800]   That redeems the time in some manner for them.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.520]   Older kid read aloud time is ready.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.060]   Do you guys read aloud with your high schoolers?
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:46.980]   Because I still did.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.140]   I still read aloud with my high schoolers.
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:56.180]   And one of the reasons I liked to do it, I actually asked my younger daughter if we could
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.300]   read her Challenge 4 literature together.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.940]   I had not read the Challenge 4 literature with my older daughter as she read it.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.920]   I had read them, but we didn't read together.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.340]   And I realized that I missed that.
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:20.760]   I missed being able to discuss the character struggles and the conflicts and the growth or
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.820]   the regression of those characters.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:27.180]   And so I really enjoyed reading aloud with my 18-year-old.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.340]   What makes older kid read aloud time so good?
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.740]   What can come of it?
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.780]   What do you think, Jennifer?
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.280]   Well, they just have great insights.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.120]   They do.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.040]   So you don't want to miss out on, even if you can't read it with them, you don't want to
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.740]   miss out on discussing it with them.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.180]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:54.300]   But I will also say, when you read aloud, both they and you hear things differently than
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.240]   they would have if they were writing aloud for themselves.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:03.560]   You notice things when you're reading aloud that you don't notice when you're reading quietly.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:09.500]   And then the other way that I was able to share with my older kids if things were busy and I
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.580]   couldn't do, my top choice would be to read with them.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.260]   My second choice would be to discuss it with them.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:21.260]   But one of the magical things about print books is that my children were often reading from copies
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.400]   that I had highlighted.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.680]   Marginal notes in and we had that being passed down.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:35.660]   And I shared on a book club with Tim earlier this week that my kids and I all read the copy
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.000]   of the discoverers that belonged to my grandfather.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.620]   Oh, cool.
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:45.560]   So being able to pass down those notes in a print version is another way to share stories
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.360]   with each other.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.780]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:56.180]   If you have a shared copy and everybody makes an underline or even a pithy note in the margin,
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:01.260]   it's almost like having a conversation not just with the author of the book, but with all the
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.240]   other people in your family who might be reading that book, too.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:14.040]   Okay, we're going to get down to this whole idea of owning our own books.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.720]   Tim, I want to give you first crack at this question.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.100]   Why should we own books of our very own?
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:27.580]   I mean, we are always encouraging people to start their own libraries.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:32.780]   And I'm always talking to my listeners about books they should own and things that they
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.300]   should gather around.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.040]   Why do you think we should own our own books?
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.760]   There's a whole host of reasons.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.660]   I will give you two to start with.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.320]   And I'm sure that you and Jennifer will have plenty of others to add.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:57.940]   But first off, I think that it's way easier to have a real relationship with a print copy
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.860]   of a book that you own.
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.660]   If you know where it is on your shelf, you know where to go get it.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.720]   And if you know that it's your copy of the book that you've read, you probably actually
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.140]   know where in the book certain things are that you're looking for.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:21.520]   And so it builds a comfort with that book and an ease with it that you don't get when it
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:26.040]   comes to a borrowed book or an electronic form of a book.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:36.920]   And then sort of the second reason it plays off that electronic form is those things come
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:44.460]   and go and they can be edited or altered without anyone giving you a heads up that it's been
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:44.900]   changed.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.120]   Oh, that's true.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:54.760]   And I think that, you know, even if you don't have your sort of tinfoil hat on and are afraid
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:30:00.880]   that everyone is changing your books all the time, which is in this day and age, certainly not as
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.320]   outlandish as it may have been in another age.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.100]   That's true.
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:13.040]   But I think our brains know that our relationship with the book is temporary when it's electronic.
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:18.020]   And so it's far easier for us to say, well, that was just that thing that I encountered
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.640]   the one time and I don't have to store that.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:26.320]   I don't need to, I don't need to think more about that or, uh, or continue to hold that in
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.800]   my memory because it was just an electronic thing that, that I flashed in front of my eyes and
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.600]   now it's gone.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.500]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:40.620]   Books that belong to me are like members of my family.
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:47.420]   There are certain books that I read and reread or refer to again and again.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:53.160]   There's some books that are so well loved that they will fall open to my favorite passage.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.440]   Um, they are comforting to me.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:03.340]   Um, and, and like you said, I have a relationship with them.
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.980]   Jennifer, why, why is it important to you?
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:11.140]   I know you have a lot of reasons that you want to own your own print copies of books.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.620]   Share some of them with us.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:18.860]   So, well, I, I share, um, Tim's concern that some of these things may vanish, first of all.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:25.200]   Um, and I will say that as many, I've tried many, many times to love, um, an e-reader and
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.280]   I have never succeeded.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:31.820]   The books to me seem that they have lost all of their life and personality.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.400]   Everything vapid.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.060]   The same.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:41.820]   Um, so I, I will admit that I do sometimes travel with one because I've had some injuries
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:47.040]   that make it harder for me to carry a lot of heavy things, but I always own physical copies
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:54.340]   of the books that are on my, um, and then I'll add a new, potentially a slightly new reason.
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:32:01.000]   Um, I mentioned before that I like to mark in my books, I find it, um, almost impossible
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.780]   not to.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:08.580]   And so really as an adult, I've found myself extremely frustrated when I read a book that
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:13.720]   belongs to someone else, because I will either want to jot down a question to the author in
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.960]   the margin, or I want to underline a particularly lovely turn of phrase.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:24.240]   Um, and it was, it was curious to me, I'll, I'll tell a little story.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:29.680]   So I got the privilege of meeting with one of my favorite living authors a couple of weeks
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.100]   ago.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:35.140]   His name's Alan Bradley and, um, he and I both share a love of Dickens.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:43.540]   One of the things he said he's been doing in his older age now is that he will just go back
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.660]   and open his favorite authors.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.700]   And also we share a love for Dickens' Bleak House.
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:53.840]   He's, he mentioned that novel by name and said that he will go back and just open it up and
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:59.600]   read any given page because he's read the story so many times that he can just appreciate Dickens'
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.880]   lovely language and descriptions.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:09.840]   So I like also just flipping back through my books sometimes and finding, um, new treasures.
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.340]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.920]   I love owning physical copies of books too.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:22.400]   You mentioned this already, Jennifer, since you are, are developing your own lending library,
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.360]   you intend to share them with people.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:29.180]   Um, I like having physical copies of books that I can share with people.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:34.720]   And there are some books that I love so much that I just buy extra copies so I can share
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:41.920]   because I'm a little territorial with my personal copy that has, that has my notes.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.340]   I mean, I, I almost would feel like I was giving away a relationship.
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:52.180]   If I gave away that copy of the book, because it's the book, that's the copy that I have built
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:58.280]   and maybe a years long relationship as I have consulted it again and again and have written
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:04.120]   my notes in the margins and my questions and, um, highlighted my favorite passages.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:12.380]   So, you know, having books of our own allows us to share those books that mean the most to
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:12.780]   us.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.620]   And so that's really cool.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:21.560]   So I, listeners, I encourage you, we all encourage you to gather around you books that you and your
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:28.480]   family can love, that you can read over and over, that you can share with others and that
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:35.880]   you can preserve, um, and that is one of the things that makes Classical Conversations Multimedia's
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:42.540]   Copper Lodge Library, um, so vital and so important.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:48.180]   Jennifer, tell us why, why did Copper Lodge Library, the imprint even get started?
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:51.420]   It has a lot to do with what we've been talking about, doesn't it?
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:52.260]   Yes.
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:58.120]   So, um, we, you know, Tim, Tim is good about bringing these stories to our attention, but we
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:03.520]   read all the time stories about, um, people not reading any books past college.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:11.360]   And I also was thinking about how there used to be a, a canon of children's literature that
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.340]   stories that everyone knew.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:18.800]   And if you refer to Rapunzel, everyone would know what you were talking about, referred to
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:24.180]   Rumpelstiltskin or Rip Van Winkle, that those cultural references that everyone would know.
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:29.300]   And it was a, a shorthand for us to talk about our community values together.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:29.980]   Right.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:35.860]   And that, that seemed like it was being lost and parents just didn't know what to read.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:42.200]   So we started off by collecting, um, those stories in the Echoes books and preserving those.
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:47.860]   And then as we got into our endeavor, of course, we found more and more good books to preserve.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:48.800]   Yes.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.680]   Copper Lodge library imprint is ever growing.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:58.040]   But I'm, as you said at the beginning, I'm very proud to be part of that endeavor to preserve
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:06.980]   these good stories, um, and these good novels and poems and plays for, for the next generation.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.620]   So not only will our communities be reading and discussing them, but now they can all
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:16.960]   have them in their hands and be, as Tim says, literally on the same page together.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.080]   Yes.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.000]   That's good.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.980]   And then as a family or in community.
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.900]   I like that being, and that, that's one of the reasons why we advocate people buying
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.740]   the Copper Lodge library edition.
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:35.160]   So if they're using it in community, everybody can say the middle of page 22 and, and the passage
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:40.240]   that you want to discuss with your friends is easy, easy to find because it's in the middle
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.740]   of everybody's page 22.
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:47.960]   And what are some other good reasons to, to use the Copper Lodge library editions, Tim?
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.760]   Oh, there's a whole bunch.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:58.020]   I think we've tried very hard to make sure that the books are beautiful and not just the,
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:03.680]   the words that the original authors have penned, which certainly are the, the most important
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:09.040]   thing, but we've all had that disappointing experience of picking up a copy of some great
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:16.920]   work and you open it up and it's, uh, you know, yellowed pages, you know, there's lines
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:24.380]   where the ink is half on and half off and, uh, you know, half a page is missing somewhere
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.440]   in the middle of the book.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:36.120]   So, uh, we've really poured a lot of time into ensuring that these are not only things that
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:41.260]   are worth engaging with on the idea level or on the prose level, but that they feel good
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:46.440]   when you pick them up, that they're easy to read, uh, you know, that it's a nice quality,
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:52.500]   heavy paper that feels, um, like, like I was saying earlier with electronic versions, they
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.300]   feel like they come and go.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:00.140]   Um, those cheap copies of books also make your brain say, well, is this really all that
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.860]   important if it's just this cheap copy?
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.220]   Uh, that's really true.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:12.100]   So, and then, uh, again, one of the most important things is that we've, uh, we've tried to make
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:18.000]   the content as accessible as possible and for our students to have great success or students
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.160]   or parents to read these books, because some of them do have things that are foreign or unfamiliar
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:33.020]   to us, uh, you know, names of things long ago or foreign words or words that have fallen out of
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.100]   regular usage.
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:41.660]   And so, um, Stephanie Meter, uh, goes through and identifies things that would aid the reader.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:46.880]   And we leave footnotes for people so that they don't have to go scrambling for their dictionary
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.300]   every time they don't know what a word means.
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:56.000]   Um, and we provide some introductory materials too, that help the reader to know maybe what
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.320]   they should be looking for or how best to approach the story that the author wrote.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:08.100]   Well, it sounds like Copper Lodge editions really are the books you want to keep.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:13.300]   That's the edition that you want to keep that has all the helps and all the beauty that just
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:17.300]   makes you feel like you are preserving something valuable.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.240]   I like that.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:23.740]   And I know that with CCMM, we are constantly bringing out new titles.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:31.820]   So, um, Tim, tell us what the 2025 titles, what are the, what are the new titles coming out
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.540]   that our students will be using in community?
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:42.460]   So our four titles this year are Jane Eyre, which is a beautiful story.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:48.200]   And, uh, we talked about earlier how, uh, books can be a great avenue for conversations,
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:54.160]   even with some of our older students and reading aloud and discussing Jane Eyre would be a great
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.840]   way to approach some very important topics that some of our students are, are entering into
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.720]   a phase of life where it's very vital that they be aware.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:08.720]   Well, and sometimes it, it, it gives you an easy way as a parent to talk about things that
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.580]   students may be wanting to talk about, but not, um, personally.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:19.260]   I don't want this to be related to me personally, but I can talk about it in relation to a character
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.020]   in a book.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:25.260]   And that's a great way for parents and students to have some difficult conversations.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:31.100]   Another conversation that is sometimes challenging is, um, a conversation about faith.
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:36.780]   Um, what, what do our children really believe and what's life really like once they leave
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.660]   the safe, safety of our homes.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:43.040]   And so Pilgrim's Progress is one of our, our books this year.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:49.020]   Um, and then a little on the lighter side, we have Alice, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:57.680]   uh, which is a delightful tale and full of lovely witty poetry and, uh, just, man, what a great
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.220]   book to read aloud with the whole family.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:00.900]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:06.240]   And then our last book for the year is A Tale of Two Cities by Jennifer's favorite author.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.100]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:12.040]   Jennifer, I was going to ask you, which of the four is your favorite?
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:16.540]   And what if, if I told you, you couldn't pick Dickens, what would you pick?
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.340]   Oh, well, I would then pick Jane Eyre.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:21.360]   All right.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:26.560]   Because that was one of the, the first, you know, really long classics of English literature
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.220]   that I read as a child.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.880]   It is a big place in my heart.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:37.580]   Um, I was also going to say that, you know, we need to have a, a bragging moment on some of
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.020]   classical conversations students.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:46.120]   So not only do we have the lovely Stephanie, Stephanie Bailey meter helping us with footnoting
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:54.220]   these additions, but we also had these four that we just named the covers were designed
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.320]   by, um, challenge students.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:02.000]   And, um, so my daughter did the cover for Alice's Adventures in Wonderland when she was
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:09.100]   interning for us and added to our staff, one of our interns, Hannah Gilmer, who has actually
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:13.320]   been busily laying out these books and finding illustrations for them.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:17.600]   And then we have another intern, Rachel Hiltz, who's been helping us to edit them.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:23.160]   So this really is a multi-generational effort to be keepers of the books.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.940]   Isn't that the coolest thing?
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:33.200]   I absolutely love seeing challenge students grow up to be keepers of the books and to work
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:39.460]   shoulder to shoulder with these young people who, um, have such a great education and such
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:43.780]   a love for, for books is really inspiring and it's a lot of fun.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:52.740]   So Tim mentioned these four, and these are, are books that our students will use at home
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:56.660]   and in community within their challenge community.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:03.360]   Um, Jennifer, there are Copper Lodge titles that parents of younger children might want to
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:08.880]   use specifically, um, in the fall as we are coming up in cycle two.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.240]   Tell us about those.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:16.340]   Yeah, so we designed some of our younger readers to loosely correspond with the geography of each
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.020]   of our nation cycles.
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:25.040]   So coming up for cycle two, we have the literature storybook, um, old world echoes, which is full
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:31.640]   of fairy tales from Europe and, um, and some places in Asia as well.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.260]   So we call it the old world for a reason.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.140]   And it corresponds with the cycle two foundations geography.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.440]   As I said, the memory work that the students are doing.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:46.280]   So we have 24 weeks of stories and poems for families to share together to go right along
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.340]   with our foundations here.
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:54.720]   And then for, um, learning a little bit about the history of Rome, we have our book senators
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:44:01.740]   of Rome, which is so we, Rome's history comes in those three sweeping periods of Kings and the
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.280]   Senate and then on to emperors.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:08.260]   And so that middle period senators of Rome is our reader for cycle two.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:15.260]   And then we have for reading wonderful science stories, um, we have, uh, our uncle Paul series
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:19.880]   and the one that goes with cycle two is exploring the oceans with uncle Paul.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:25.820]   And although that is the title, we should say that uncle Paul is exploring these things with
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.480]   his niece and his nephews.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:31.660]   So that's another thing that makes it a wonderful homeschool read aloud.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:32.540]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:33.560]   Yes.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.040]   Oh, and, and they are fun stories.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:44.660]   We have done some of those, some read alouds from all three of those, um, old world echoes
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.880]   exploring the oceans and senators in Rome.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.920]   We've done some read alouds, summer read alouds.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:55.040]   And, um, I have had feedback that students want to keep asking their parents, what comes
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:55.480]   next?
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.620]   What comes next?
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:57.820]   We need to get that book.
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.220]   So parents out there, you, you've heard it here.
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:07.140]   You know, what books, what Copper Lodge library books you need to look for that are new additions
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.500]   coming out that your challenge students will see in community.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:18.700]   And now Jennifer has told us which cycle two readers would be a great addition to your library
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:25.060]   for summer or fall read alouds at home, um, this coming year.
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:29.520]   Well, it's about time for us to end this episode.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:35.920]   Is there any last word that you want to offer as a keeper of the book, Jennifer or Tim?
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:42.200]   Just that I hope we've inspired our listeners to start to own some of their own books and
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.880]   to build their family library of whatever size.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:49.700]   It doesn't have to be thousands of volumes, as long as you pick a few really good ones to
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:49.920]   own.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:56.660]   And then I'm hoping to also hand those down to my children that we can all have that family
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:57.220]   heritage.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:58.000]   Yep.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.280]   A heritage of reading.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:45:59.860]   That's cool.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:00.720]   Tim, what about you?
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.800]   One final plug to be a keeper of the book.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.620]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.140]   Read early, read often, and read widely.
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.220]   Oh, that is awesome advice.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.080]   Okay, guys, you've gotten all the good advice.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:17.440]   Go and build your library and enjoy reading along the way.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.740]   And I'll see you next week.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:19.600]   Bye-bye.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:20.100]   you
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:20.600]   you
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.100]   you
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:21.600]   you
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.100]   you
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:22.600]   you
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.660]   you
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.160]   you
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:55.140]   Thank you.
