[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480]   Pretty heavy topic today.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.160]   Can we lie?
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.080]   Can we lie to women who are seeking abortions?
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.960]   If by lying, we increase the likelihood
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.960]   of saving the baby's life.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.000]   When this question came in,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.080]   it immediately grabbed my attention.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.520]   It's a question from an anonymous woman,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.240]   Pastor John, hello, and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.220]   I work in a crisis pregnancy center
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.440]   in a small community in the Bible Belt,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.940]   helping meet the needs of pregnant women
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.320]   and single mothers,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.080]   along with providing access to clothing
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.920]   and parenting classes.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.400]   We also share the glorious message
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.640]   of Christ's work on the cross for sinners.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.000]   It is our desire that expecting mothers
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.360]   make the right choice.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.560]   I know God is sovereign and only the Holy Spirit
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.320]   can make dead hearts come alive
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.160]   to make those right decisions.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.240]   And this leads to my question.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.240]   Our clinic has experienced pressure
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.920]   from volunteers and leaders,
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.000]   supported by local pastors,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.160]   to pressure women and couples to save the baby,
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.840]   or else the mother and father
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.680]   will be condemning their child to an eternal hell
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.840]   for withholding from them a chance to be born,
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.840]   to live, and to accept Christ as their savior.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.760]   You have made a strong case that babies who die
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.120]   or who are killed are saved.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.640]   I'm thinking of APJ's 514 and 684,
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.680]   the theology I hear in the clinic is wrong,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.120]   and I think others in the clinic know it's wrong too.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   I've come now to believe that this is an intentionally
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.720]   manipulative scare tactic,
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.120]   an anything-goes approach to the goal of saving lives.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.320]   And that's my question for you.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.960]   Is it permissible to intentionally scare
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.560]   and manipulate mothers with untrue doctrine
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.500]   if it increases the likelihood that a baby will live?
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.600]   If this question were simply a yes and no question
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.120]   with no other implications, I'd probably skip it.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.960]   (laughs)
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.440]   I'd say, "Tony, let's just move on,"
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.920]   because nobody wants to listen to an episode
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.400]   where I say, "No, next question."
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   But that is my short answer, namely, no.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.600]   No, it's not permissible.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.080]   From a biblical point of view,
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.520]   from a Christian point of view,
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.320]   it is not permissible to intentionally scare
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.680]   and manipulate mothers with untrue doctrine
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.040]   in order to increase the likelihood that a baby will live.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.360]   No.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   And I'm not just focusing on the scare and manipulate part.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.860]   That's bad enough.
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.200]   When I say no, I'm mainly focusing
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.320]   on the use of untrue doctrine.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.320]   Doctrinal falsehoods lies in the service of a guess
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:01.760]   as to whether a child's life will be saved.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.760]   In other words, I'm saying no to making a practice of lying
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.600]   about sacred things in order to increase,
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.000]   according to our own human guesswork,
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.280]   the possibility that a child would not be aborted.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.720]   I'm saying no to that.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.480]   But the reason I'm willing to say more about this question
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.720]   rather than just no is that there are wider
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.720]   cultural implications behind that question as I hear it.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.160]   This practice of bending or marginalizing
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.480]   or flatly contradicting serious biblical moral considerations
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.480]   in a human invented so-called life-saving strategy
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.240]   has taken root in American Christianity in recent years
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   with harmful effects, which we have scarcely seen the end of.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.040]   In other words, I don't think this particular practice
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.040]   of compromising moral means to accomplish hoped-for
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.800]   good ends is the only case we're facing.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.560]   So let me try to say something about this kind of strategy
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.680]   against that wider cultural situation.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.000]   The biblical reality at stake,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.280]   the biblical reality at the root of the issue
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.520]   is that God is a God of truth.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.440]   God never lies, Titus 1, 2.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.440]   Let God be true though every man a liar, Romans 3, 4.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.920]   And consequentially, his people are people of truth.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.280]   We are workers for the truth, 3 John 1, 8.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.280]   We speak the truth with our neighbor, Ephesians 4, 25.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.520]   We cannot do anything against the truth,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.920]   2 Corinthians 13, 8.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.120]   We do not lie to one another, Colossians 3, 9.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.120]   We do not join the devil in his nature.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.960]   For when he lies, he speaks out of his own character,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.720]   for he is a liar and the father of lies, John 8, 44.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.400]   Truth is at the heart of who God is
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.040]   and at the heart of who we are as his people.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.560]   So a so-called life-saving strategy
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.000]   built on regular deception
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.320]   is utterly contrary to who God is
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.000]   and who we are as his people.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.600]   It aligns us with the devil,
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.400]   who is not only a deceiver from the beginning,
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.000]   but also a murderer.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.720]   So to think we can borrow the devil's strategy
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.720]   of deception to save life is going to backfire.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.160]   And we are going to be found serving his purposes, not God's.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.160]   Now, add to this basic truth about God and his people,
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.360]   the biblical abhorrence of doing evil that good may come.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.360]   In other words, coming up with human strategies
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.600]   that involve moral compromise
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.760]   in order to pursue human guesses
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.440]   that more good will come that way.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.400]   The Bible opposes that presumption.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.560]   For example, the apostle Paul defending himself
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.560]   against that very accusation in Romans 3, 5, following,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.560]   if our unrighteousness serves to show God's righteousness,
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.880]   what should we say?
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.080]   That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us?
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.440]   I speak in a human way.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.920]   By no means, for then how could God judge the world?
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.920]   But if through my lie, God's truth abounds to his glory,
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.680]   why am I still being condemned as a sinner?
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.080]   And why not do evil that good may come?
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.040]   As some people slanderously charge us with saying
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.160]   their condemnation is just.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.000]   Wow.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.200]   When people accuse Paul of teaching that we may do evil,
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.680]   that good may come, he's angry.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.320]   And he says, let them be condemned.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   That's serious.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.200]   Later in Romans 6, he asks,
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.000]   are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.720]   And his answer is not just no.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.720]   His answer is that it contradicts the very nature
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.840]   of who we are as new creatures in Christ.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.320]   How can you who died to sin still live in it?
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:17.200]   In other words, new creatures in Christ trust God
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.320]   with the outcomes of walking in Christian integrity
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.480]   and holiness.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.120]   We trust God with the outcomes.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.120]   Christians should not do evil that good may come.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.520]   It's a lack of faith.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:38.480]   We should not embrace evil practices or evil people
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.040]   in the vain hope that such compromises
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:47.040]   will advance human created strategies for doing good.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   It is virtually certain that our duplicity will be exposed,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.640]   indeed shouted from the housetops.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:03.400]   And when it is, the undermining of Christian integrity
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:09.320]   may send more people to hell and more babies to the dumpsters
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.160]   than if we had spoken the whole truth,
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.960]   lived consistent lives of radical Christian integrity,
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.400]   loved others, made sacrifices,
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.200]   and been willing to suffer and prayed earnestly.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.360]   I think that one of the great needs of the hour
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.520]   is for Christians to stop compromising
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.520]   our biblical faithfulness by using the weapons of the world
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.280]   in the service of strategies that we think
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.360]   are more likely to do good because we have calculated
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.160]   that compromise will work.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.160]   - Hmm.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.080]   - Here's a closing admonition from Paul
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.960]   in 2 Corinthians 10, 3.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.760]   "Though we walk in the flesh,
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.760]   "we are not waging war according to the flesh.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.400]   "For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh,
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:13.320]   "but have divine power to destroy strongholds."
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:18.320]   God is able to make consistent, humble, trusting,
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.800]   sacrificial obedience have vast soul-saving,
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.560]   life-giving effects beyond all our human calculations
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.000]   of what good may come through compromise.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.840]   - Pointed words.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.680]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.600]   And that Romans 3:8 text is worth a lot of reflection.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.960]   Why not do evil that good may come?
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.480]   That text came up another time on this podcast
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.160]   in another episode on abortion of all places.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.640]   In APJ 684, that episode was about
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.920]   if all babies go to heaven, why oppose abortion?
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.400]   And you can find that one, APJ 684 at askpastorjohn.com,
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.120]   very much related on the other side of the spectrum
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.560]   to this question.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.440]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.480]   And thanks for joining us today.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.400]   If you wanna ask Pastor John, type out your question,
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.160]   even your most sensitive question,
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.400]   and email it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.680]   Feel free to make it anonymous
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.480]   if the question or your situation requires it.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.560]   We always honor that, of course.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.440]   Have a wonderful weekend,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.880]   and we'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:41.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
