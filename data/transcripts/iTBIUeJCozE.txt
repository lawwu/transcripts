[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   We've never been afraid of ruffling feathers on the podcast. And as we move into the epicenter
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.320]   of the Christmas season, that's good because no APJ question is more common this time of year
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.400]   than questions over what Christian parents should do with Santa Claus. What should we do with old
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.240]   Saint Nick, Pastor John? It's been asked of us over 70 times now in the APJ inbox.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.040]   Every year, this question comes up over and over again. Now, of course, Pastor John,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.600]   as you know, there's a fourth century Greek historical figure named Saint Nicholas,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.960]   but most of the questions, in fact, I think all 70 of those questions that we have received are
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.600]   all about the mythic, white bearded, red suited reindeer flying Santa Claus, that guy.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.160]   And James from Ontario recently wrote in to ask us, Pastor John, what do you think about
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.640]   Christian parents who allow their children to believe Santa Claus is bringing them gifts on
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.960]   Christmas? Cut it straight for us, Pastor John. What do you say about Santa this time of year?
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.360]   After Easter, Christmas should be the happiest day of the year in Christian worship.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:11.200]   The reason I say after Easter is that Good Friday and Easter is the goal of Christmas.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.360]   The death and resurrection, the salvation of sinners through the death and resurrection of
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.040]   Jesus is the goal of Christmas. Christmas is not the goal of Easter. Christmas is a means
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.200]   the salvation of sinners on Good Friday and Easter is the goal. Jesus came at Christmas
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.960]   to seek and save the lost. Luke 19. Jesus came at Christmas to save sinners. 1 Timothy 1.15.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.120]   Jesus came at Christmas to give his life a ransom for many. Mark 10. Jesus came at Christmas not to
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.920]   call the righteous but sinners. Matthew 9. Jesus came at Christmas to destroy the works of the
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.760]   devil. 1 John 3. Jesus came at Christmas that through death he might destroy the one who has
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.880]   the power of death. Hebrews 2.14. So the birth of the Son of God, the very God, very man is simply
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.440]   stunning and glorious and infinitely serious and overflowing with happy news. The angel called it
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.200]   good news of great joy. Great joy. Not small joy, not a little bit of joy, but great joy.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:22.720]   So my question is this. How could we possibly even think of giving our children a bowl of bland,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.400]   sugarless porridge when they are offered the greatest meal in the world? Why would we give
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:38.560]   them Santa Claus when they can have the incarnation of the Son of God? I mean, it's just mind-boggling
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.840]   to me that any Christian would even contemplate such a trade, that we would divert attention away
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.800]   from the incarnation of the God of the universe into this world to save us and our children in
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.840]   order toâ€”I mean, I can scarcely have words for it, that people would contemplate this.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:09.280]   Not only is Santa Claus not true, and Jesus is very truth himself, but compared to Jesus,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.920]   Santa is simply pitiful, and our kids should be helped to see this. Santa Claus offers
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.920]   only earthly things, nothing lasting, nothing eternal. Jesus offers eternal joy with the world
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.440]   thrown in. Yeah, the fire engine is thrown in. Santa Claus offers his ephemeral goodies only
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.240]   on the condition of good works. He knows when you are bleep. He knows when you've been bad or good
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.440]   to be good, for goodness sakes. That's a pure works religion. And Jesus offers himself all the
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.760]   gifts freely by grace for faith. Santa Claus is make-believe. Jesus is more real than the roof
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.920]   on your house. Santa Claus, he only shows up once a year. Jesus promises, "I'll be with you always."
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.880]   You say to your kid, "Every night, every night, he's standing by your bed. He's with you when
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.040]   you get up in the morning. He's with you when you go to school today. If mommy and daddy die,
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:15.120]   he will be right there with you." Santa doesn't hold a candle to this flaming Jesus. Santa Claus
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.720]   cannot solve our worst problem. And Jesus did solve our worst problem, our sin and our alienation
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.280]   from God. Santa Claus, he can put some icing on the cake of the good life, but he cannot take a
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.520]   shattered life and rebuild it with hope forever. And our kids need to know that about Christmas.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.920]   Santa Claus is not relevant in many cultures of the world. And Jesus is the King of kings and
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.680]   Lord of lords in all the peoples of the world. Santa Claus will be forgotten someday, and Jesus
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:54.000]   will be the same yesterday, today, and forever. So, Tony, there is no contest here. So I cannot
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.960]   see why a parent, if they know and love Jesus, if they have found Jesus to be the greatest treasure
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   in the world, why they would bring Jesus out of the celebration and Santa into the celebration
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.120]   at all? I mean, he's just irrelevant. He has nothing to do with it. He's zero.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.760]   So my counsel is to give all your efforts to making your children as happy as they can possibly be
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.480]   with every kind of surprise that is rooted in the true meaning of Christmas.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:32.000]   Let your decorations point to Jesus. Let your food point to Jesus. Let your games point to Jesus. Let
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.160]   your singing point to Jesus. Out rejoice the world, out give the world, out decorate the world,
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:47.600]   and let it all point to Jesus. If being Jesus-focused is a killjoy for your Christmas,
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:56.080]   you don't know him well. Wow. A little abrasive, but necessarily so. Also valuable and edifying.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.400]   Thank you, Pastor John, for putting these thoughts together. And coming up on Wednesday,
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.760]   we're going to hear from a listener with a really simple, but it's a question I don't
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.880]   think we've ever received in the inbox before. It's simply this, "Pastor John, what is your
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.600]   favorite hymn?" I'll ask him on Wednesday because you asked. You can email your own questions to us
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   via our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn. I'm your host Tony Ranke. We'll see you on Wednesday.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.000]   you
