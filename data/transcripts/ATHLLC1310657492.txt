[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.920]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.040]   your life, money, and travel, all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.480]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.120]   journey to find all the hacks.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.400]   Now, in today's world, we are constantly surrounded by photos, videos,
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.520]   and more of all the amazing things everyone else is doing.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.280]   And I'd be surprised if you don't often feel the FOMO that comes with it.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.000]   I know I do.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.720]   And if you're an optimizer like me, you might also find yourself facing a fair
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.160]   amount of FOBO as well, which is a new term I learned from today's guests
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.920]   and sort of like FOMO's cousin.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.560]   It's the fear of a better option.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.600]   And it often manifests itself for me as analysis paralysis, and it can take a
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.200]   toll on even the smallest decisions.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.440]   So that's why I am so excited to be talking with Patrick McGinnis, because
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.600]   in 2004, he actually first coined the terms FOMO and FOBO.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.880]   Since then, he's been featured in the New York Times, Politico, and more.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.920]   He's given a popular TED talk on decision-making.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.320]   He's written two bestselling books, The 10% Entrepreneur, Live Your
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   Startup Dream Without Quitting Your Day Job, and most recently, Fear of Missing
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.240]   Out, Practical Decision-Making in a World of Overwhelming Choice.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.440]   Finally, he's the host of the hit podcast, FOMO Sapiens, where I will
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.360]   be joining him next week as a guest.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.440]   In our conversation, we'll talk about the history of FOMO, ways to overcome
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.240]   the toll it can have on our lives.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.040]   We'll talk about FOBO and hear Patrick's framework to vastly
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.320]   improve your decision-making.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.480]   And finally, he'll share some of his favorite life hacks.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.800]   One quick thing before we get started.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.080]   I'm considering working with a few sponsors to support the show.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.480]   They'll only be brands I believe in, and you'll be able to fast forward
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.040]   the ads if you're not interested.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.440]   But I just want to let you know in advance, and hopefully you understand,
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.280]   that it's all in service of continuing to deliver an amazing show to you each week.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.480]   All right, so let's jump in.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.440]   Patrick, thanks for being here.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.800]   It's my pleasure.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.360]   How are you?
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.200]   You know, I fractured my foot last night on the dance floor at a
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.600]   wedding, which was not fun.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.800]   Um, but you know, I'm here.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.200]   If you're going to break your foot, that's a good reason to do it.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.440]   It's either going to be athletics or dancing.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.840]   Those are the only two excuses.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.520]   Although at the hospital, I was telling people, I was like,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.320]   "Oh, they're hedges."
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.000]   I was like, "Dancing."
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.240]   They're like, "Oh, are you a professional dancer?"
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.560]   It's like, "No, I was at a dance.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.400]   I was at a wedding.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.520]   We were drinking.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.680]   The floor was slippery."
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.120]   Anyways, so you've got a word in the dictionary.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.920]   I never even thought to put that on my bucket list.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.200]   And now I'm a little jealous.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.480]   Did you ever imagine FOMO becoming such a major part of our culture
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.880]   when you first coined the term?
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.120]   I did not.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.880]   In fact, I wrote this article back in 2004 and I put it in the humor section
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.560]   of our school newspaper over at Harvard Business School, which, I mean, the fact
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.840]   I was writing for the newspaper at a business school tells you that I was
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.800]   not the usual person, I guess.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.120]   And how long did it take before you kind of realized that you'd created this
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.200]   thing that you'd be hearing every day and in the media and just in casual
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.760]   conversation?
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.320]   So I did a forensic analysis, actually.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.840]   I actually hired a person, like a web, I don't know, forensic expert to try to
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.880]   understand what the heck happened, because I missed out on this whole thing.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.960]   I was not aware of FOMO's prominence, actually, until a reporter called me one
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.840]   day and he said, "You invented the word FOMO."
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.280]   And I said, "Yeah, that's true.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.880]   Why do you care?"
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.280]   And he said, "Well, it's in the dictionary."
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.160]   And I was like, "What?"
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.680]   This was in 2014, 10 years after I wrote that article.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.720]   And so when I got more involved and was working on a book about the topic, I
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.080]   decided to really get into it and try to figure out what happened and what I was
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.600]   able to reconstruct through my own research and then the work of the
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.320]   forensic person is that, you know, my article came out in 2004.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.680]   It was the first time it was used anywhere in an article called McGinnis'
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.360]   Two Foes, Social Theory at Harvard Business School.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.760]   And then it stayed on in the school because it became very popular and it
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.360]   became a term that was used there.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.200]   And then it spread to other MBA programs.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.440]   And in 2007, three years later, Business Week wrote an article about FOMO at
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.240]   business schools. And so that was kind of a moment and it's sort of popularity
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.640]   spreading. And then in 2009, a woman called Katrina Fake, who is the founder
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.200]   of Flickr, wrote a blog post about it in reference to South by Southwest.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.800]   And sometimes people credit her with being the creator of FOMO and, you know,
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   it's just the internet doesn't lie.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.680]   She used the term and popularized it for sure, but it was not her creation.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.080]   And then from there, it really took off and it was admitted to the dictionary in
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.720]   2013.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.360]   Wow.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.480]   And what was the premise of the original article?
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.600]   So the article was, it's actually, I think it's a funny article still.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.800]   I like when I read it, I'm always like, I'm pleased that I wrote it.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.640]   I was like, wow, he's a much better writer than I think I imagined at the
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:49.800]   time. But it's this satirical piece about the day in the life of a typical
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.160]   student in an MBA program and how they struggle to do all of these things.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.480]   And I actually give somebody's calendar, sort of like at six o'clock you go to
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.920]   drinks with friends at six 45, you go stop by a lecture at six, you know, for
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.040]   seven minutes to say hello to this one girl you met.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.280]   Then five minutes later, you're off to dinner.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.040]   And then, you know, I sort of take you through and then there are four birthday
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.400]   parties and, you know, you're out until three.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.800]   And so it sort of, because that was the life that we led.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.400]   And I always, I'm from a small town in Maine called Sanford, Maine.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.840]   It's really simple.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.560]   People don't live that way.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.400]   It's a kind of place where you do like one thing a day.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.320]   And then to find myself in this really uber social environment, which was very
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.360]   much fueled by the fact that we had just come out of 9/11 and people were sort of
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.200]   like, you know, realize the fragility of life and how you have to live life to the
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.480]   fullest because it was so different than the life I had known before.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.720]   I decided I had to write an article about it because it was this, you know, I
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.040]   started using this word FOMO and I was like, I got to write about this because
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.240]   it's like, I'm going to leave this place and go back to the normal world and I'm
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.480]   not going to have this craziness in my life anymore.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.960]   Of course, now we all have FOMO because of social media.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.120]   And funny enough, when I wrote the article, Mark Zuckerberg was a mile away
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.080]   from me on the other side of the Charles River inventing the first version of
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.840]   Facebook. And I credit sort of him and Facebook and social media with making
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.760]   FOMO much more than a sort of high class problem, but something that all of us
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.000]   feel.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.160]   And, and just so we're all on the same page, you know, as the, as the term
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.560]   creator, do you have a definition that you prefer for FOMO?
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.560]   I'm sure there are many in different dictionaries.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.040]   It's a great question.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.440]   Nobody's ever asked me that before.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.480]   And it's true.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.600]   So when I decided to write this book, I did a ton of research because I'm not a
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.280]   psychologist, nor did I ever claim to be a psychologist, but psychologists love to
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:36.960]   write about FOMO.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.080]   And there have been so many journal articles.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.720]   Like it's quite amazing to me.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.520]   Then you have a bunch of PhDs writing articles about FOMO.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.120]   It's just mind blowing.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.640]   And so I read all of them and I realized that there was no consistency in how the
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.480]   academic world and the clinical psychology world was defining FOMO.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.680]   And then I read all of the dictionary versions, obviously, and the urban
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.400]   dictionary definition as well, which is, you know, one of the first times it was
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.080]   written about actually in about 2007, I believe.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.560]   And I realized that it was all over the map.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.720]   And so I formulated a definition that is my standard definition.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.360]   And the definition is this.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:19.640]   FOMO is an anxiety often fueled by social media based on the perception that other
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.160]   people are having more beneficial experiences than you.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.400]   And it is a fear of being excluded from a beneficial collective experience.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.600]   And you said a perception.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.800]   So obviously it doesn't have to be reality to be FOMO.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.920]   Exactly.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.240]   So that's where the rubber hits the road in terms of the pathology of this whole
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.240]   thing is its perception.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.400]   So you see something and that's why social media is so insidious.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.080]   You see something, it looks amazing.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.720]   But we all know that it's filtered and that it's a moment in time and that the
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.840]   things that were being served up, especially on Instagram, for example, are
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.120]   they do not correspond to reality, but we don't think critically about that.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.320]   And so you see something that isn't even real, but it provokes feelings of
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.120]   inadequacy and of anxiety and stress.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.840]   And so you're spending a lot of energy focused on something that's not even
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.840]   possible.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.280]   And that's where the perception comes in.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.720]   I often, you know, the way I think about it is perception is often deception.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.480]   I have to think most people know this, right?
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.240]   Most people, if you ask them consciously are like, yeah, of course, I'm only
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.360]   seeing the best of this.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.240]   I'm seeing my friend with three kids on a vacation and they're all smiling and
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.560]   having fun and a vacation with three kids might have those moments, but it
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.280]   certainly has other moments as well.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.920]   Is there a reason that people are just kind of unable to process that reality
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.280]   when they see these images, when they hear about these things?
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.120]   And is there a way that they can avoid it?
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:52.040]   There is, and you know, I think the reality is that people know, but these
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:57.000]   companies that make social media networks and other things, and not just
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.360]   social media, of course, it can be in things you see on television or things
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.800]   you hear about in the real world.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.280]   But focusing particularly on social media is these companies are extremely
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:12.760]   sophisticated and they are creating habit forming applications that are designed to
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.360]   manipulate you.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:19.560]   You know, the attention economy as it's been referred to, it's all about stealing
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.360]   your attention and presenting you with things that manipulate you.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.960]   So, you know, it's not your fault.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.400]   It's not like we're all idiots.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.400]   It's that the system as it's been created is so powerful and so well done.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.720]   Now, what I tend to think and what I recommend people to do and what I do for
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.520]   myself, because I know highly susceptible, I'm the first FOMO sapiens, right?
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.840]   I am the creator of FOMO.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.760]   I feel FOMO like cripplingly and I've had to really learn how to manage that.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.720]   And so what I have done is I'm very mindful about when I use social media, how
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.520]   it makes me feel.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.880]   And for example, say I'm following some person on Facebook or something and they
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.760]   put a post up, it makes me feel inadequate or it makes me want to devalue what I
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.960]   have in my own life.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.880]   I unfollow that person.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.600]   If I'm using Instagram and it makes me feel stressed, I close it down.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.880]   I think that's the critical thing is understand why you're opening that app,
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.400]   understand what you're getting from it and understand the unintended consequences
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.680]   of the use of that app.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.360]   And if you do that, it's great because it's kind of like eating food, right?
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.200]   Like if you eat something, you just stuff it in your mouth.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.160]   It doesn't make you feel good.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.600]   You're not going to eat more of it.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.880]   So why would you do the same thing with social media?
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.360]   Yeah, I mean, if you want to get to the end of the feed, you want to finish the
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.880]   plate, you know, I grew up in a clean plate club household.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.560]   So, you know, even if you don't like it, I feel like I have this burning desire to
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.440]   finish a meal without any control.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.920]   And so does that mean that you, are you someone who doesn't sleep with the phone
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.040]   on the side of the bed?
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.800]   Or do you treat your phone differently in your household to try to avoid some of
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.440]   these things?
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:01.400]   It's such a good question because I remember I read some stat when I was
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.600]   researching and the number of people who sleep with their phone by the bed is
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:07.960]   mind-blowing.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.120]   It's north of 80% might be north of 90% these days.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.280]   And I remember, I mean, I, we all know these people, maybe it's you who's
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.920]   listening who sleep with their phone under the pillow.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.120]   Do you do that?
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.800]   No, no.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.560]   I keep, I mean, I do keep it near the bed.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.960]   So here's the thing, not good, but about the phone, right?
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.120]   So the phone, they're smart.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.360]   Like it's, again, it's like really well-designed kind of stuff.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.000]   Like the phone manufacturers and designers put an alarm clock on the
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.320]   phone and that's the Trojan horse.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.720]   Cause you're like, it's very reliable.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   And so you want to have the phone near you.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.680]   So you have the alarm clock.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.280]   That's why a lot of people started the culture of bringing the phone into the
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:48.780]   bedroom.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.440]   And once you do that, then you've let it into your personal space and then
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:52.920]   you're done.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.800]   And so what I learned, I used to do that myself.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.280]   And then I decided a number of years ago to leave it in the other room.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.840]   And I found it had a tremendous benefit for me.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.760]   And then I was given this phone bed.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.080]   Ariana Huffington actually makes these phone beds.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.360]   Like you tuck your phone into a little bed at the end of the day.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.800]   It's really cute actually.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.400]   And so she gave me one of those.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.320]   So I use that now for my phone.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.600]   Are there other habits to adopt that help lighten?
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.880]   I guess now that I have a noun for it, since FOMO is an anxiety to lighten that
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.380]   anxiety.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.600]   So a couple of things that I would recommend people to do.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.080]   Number one is you need to monitor your phone use and all of our phones have
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.960]   these digital wellness suites now that are built into them.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.040]   And so I take a good look every week at how I'm spending my time online.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.720]   It's just helpful to be mindful of like, oh my goodness, why did I spend 43
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.840]   minutes a day on Instagram?
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.000]   Like, what did that give me and why did I pick that up?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.360]   So just thinking about the root cause of why you engage in social media, it's
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.480]   really important to do.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.280]   Another thing that I recommend people to do is if you find that you're unable to
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.480]   control your use of a certain site, like there's a site called Political Wire
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.720]   that is very addictive and I love it, but it makes me feel bad.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.520]   So I have a rule that I'm only allowed to look at that site when I'm at a
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.680]   desktop and not on my phone.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.440]   And that really helps me to cut down on my usage.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.320]   It's just like a rule I have.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.040]   I'm not allowed to look at Twitter either on my phone and I don't do that.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.440]   And when I slip up, I notice that my quality of life goes down dramatically.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:27.640]   And then there are some other hacks that I don't have any distractive apps on my
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.120]   front page.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.120]   I have to go into a folder to find them.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.680]   And so I create sort of a barrier and that makes it a bit hard to use them.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.960]   And the other thing that some people do, which I have not chosen to do, but some
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.240]   find helpful, is to put your phone in grayscale.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.200]   And I'm actually going to try, I have a little hack I'm going to try now.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.440]   I'm announcing this to the world today on your show.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:51.480]   I'm going to buy the iPhone mini because it is my view that if you have a smaller
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.480]   phone, you are less likely to want to pick it up all the time and look at stuff
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.000]   because it's less of an in-your-face kind of thing.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.960]   The bigger the screen, the more the temptation is to watch a video and all
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.520]   that sort of stuff.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.920]   I want less fun in my life, a lot more.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.600]   And so I'm going to get a smaller phone.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.320]   I like that.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.960]   I mean, you could go all the way back and get an old Motorola Razr that can't do
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.520]   anything.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.960]   I'm not interested in that.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.720]   It's a fascinating concept because I know people who have done that.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.720]   My view with all of this stuff is it's not about abstinence.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.280]   It's about sort of having a healthy diet.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.920]   If you're trying to lose weight and you just don't eat anything for days and
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.560]   days, that's not sustainable.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.280]   It's not healthy.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.320]   And also it's not fun.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:39.480]   And so I would much more be interested in changing my diet to something that I
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.920]   can learn to enjoy.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.640]   I lost like 50 pounds in high school.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.160]   I used to eat bacon double cheeseburgers every Friday night and a Boston cream
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:47.640]   pie.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.200]   I mean, that was what I thought I liked.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.640]   And nowadays I have a much healthier diet and I enjoy that.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.560]   And I don't want Boston cream pie, actually.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.280]   Like if you gave me Boston cream pie, I would say I'm good.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:58.840]   Right.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.080]   And so I think it has to be that with the way that we think about how we engage
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.720]   with technology.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.220]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.600]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.320]   I get it.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:14.120]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.080]   good hang.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.080]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.960]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.680]   for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.480]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.320]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.480]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.280]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.360]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.440]   list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.720]   ever leaving yours.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.480]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.920]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.120]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.040]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.920]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.000]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.960]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.240]   Now, we talked a lot about technology.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.040]   You did a lot of research for the book.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.200]   Is this a new phenomenon, right?
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.240]   You talked about it before there was social media.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.280]   How do you think the concept of FOMO has evolved?
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.000]   So FOMO is part of the experience of being a human.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.240]   It goes back to the earliest humans.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.680]   And I did a bunch of research on sort of evolutionary biology.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:48.040]   The fact that the earliest humans were keenly aware of what they needed and
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.600]   what they didn't have in order to survive.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.840]   So they ran with the pack.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.440]   You stayed in the group because if you weren't in the group, you didn't get the
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.520]   information about where the best water was, where the best food was, where you
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.240]   should do your migratory pattern, where there's good shelter.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.800]   And also you're more vulnerable to attack.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.920]   And in fact, if you've ever been to Africa and seen the migration of the
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.640]   wildebeest, or just Google it if you haven't had a shot to go there, because
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.400]   it's really quite incredible.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:20.200]   The wildebeest migrate across the Serengeti and they stick in a herd.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   And it's called a swarm migration because if one gets separated, then it'll get
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.680]   attacked and the predators will eat them.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.880]   But if they stick together, maybe they get one, but they don't kill them all
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.040]   off.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.640]   And so it's part of their evolutionary biology to stick with the crap.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.360]   So it was part of how we survived physically.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.800]   It has evolved into something much more emotional over time.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.640]   And one of the cool things that I realized in my research, this is like one
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.560]   of the most crazy things that ever happened to me in my life, which is that
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.560]   the term keeping up with the Joneses, that is sort of analog FOMO.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:59.000]   It was a comic strip from a hundred years ago in the New York Globe newspaper
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.880]   about this family that lived next to this Jones family.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.480]   And they were trying to keep up with them all the time.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.800]   And it was like, you know, Oh, Mr. Jones is like wearing a red tie.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.160]   Dad, you got to get a red tie.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.680]   It's not like the most humorous thing I've ever read, but the name of the
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   family that's feeling all this FOMO is the McGinnis family.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.680]   So I have a fictional ancestor who invented FOMO.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.760]   Somebody wrote that in a paper actually.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.280]   And they tied him to me, which was, I couldn't believe it.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.560]   I still kind of blows my mind.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.480]   But I guess the point of all that is that it is something that we've always
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:36.120]   had the difference is that we think about core drivers of FOMO, you know,
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.640]   it's things like information, the quantity of information you're receiving, right?
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.400]   So that you have more data points.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.800]   It's the ability to compare yourself with others.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.320]   The more interconnected we are, the more we can see what other people are doing.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:53.000]   And so over time, just the amount of people that are in your daily sort of
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.040]   experience has gone through the roof, especially with social media.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:02.440]   And so, you know, if you were living a hundred years ago in my hometown in Maine,
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.920]   you didn't really know what was going on outside of there.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.280]   You were served up very specific elements of FOMO, like a cigarette
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.000]   commercial or something where celebrities are like smoking so beautiful.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.200]   Like, isn't this great?
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.160]   Like we love cigarettes and maybe you were susceptible, but now it's like
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.040]   everything you do, you're being served up this content.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.400]   You said something earlier about the abundance of information.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.360]   And it reminded me that your original article was actually about two things.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.640]   It wasn't just FOMO.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.880]   It was this thing FOBO, which since getting to know you, I'd learned as a thing.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:37.960]   And I actually think could possibly, and I'm curious your perspective, be an even more
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:43.240]   difficult or bigger strain on people's days, especially when it comes to
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.640]   work and not just social life.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:51.160]   How do you compare the two and especially the relative impact they have on society
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:51.880]   and people's lives?
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.400]   So FOBO stands for fear of a better option.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.400]   And it's the idea that when you have to make a decision and you have perfectly
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.640]   acceptable things in front of you, that you are sort of holding out for the
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.040]   riskless option, like the perfect thing.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.320]   And so you're like, well, you know, I'm just going to wait until it's so clear to
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.000]   me that this thing is the right decision.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.400]   And so people, you know, sort of delay and it's really, it's an affliction of
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:22.280]   abundance in an affluent society where you have everything you need.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.880]   Then you can get stuck in this place.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.640]   Like if you don't have options, whether it's food, if you don't have sufficient
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.120]   food, you're not going to be like, well, let's see, I don't know what to have
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:30.280]   today.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.760]   You're going to be like, I'm going to eat whatever I can get.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.000]   Right.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.440]   If you live in a place where the economy is terrible and there's no jobs, you're
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.880]   not going to be like interviewing for 17 jobs and waiting for the, it's just,
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.600]   you're not going to do that.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.480]   And so I think it's much more damaging than FOMO for the simple reason that FOMO
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.400]   does have positive aspects.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.600]   FOMO can be a tremendous and powerful motivator of human behavior if used in
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.160]   the right ways.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:02.440]   FOMO is just bad because you don't decide on things and you are, once again,
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.960]   sort of mired in the perception that there's something better that's going to
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.600]   come for you.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.600]   And as you wait for that perfect thing, the exceptional options that you have in
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.720]   front of you right now may disappear and you'll end up with nothing.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.120]   And so I always think of FOMO like drinking wine.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.480]   A little wine is great.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.360]   Loosens you up.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.640]   Maybe try something new.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.680]   Dance on that dance floor.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   Don't break your foot.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.560]   Too much wine.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.320]   You know, you're not going to feel good the next day.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.840]   FOMO is like smoking cigarettes.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.480]   Bad for you.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.160]   Bad for everybody around you.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.120]   Feels good.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:30.360]   Sure.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.520]   But nothing good for you.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:38.600]   And is FOMO directly linked or maybe even a synonym to analysis paralysis or
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.520]   how do you, are those similar?
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.400]   They are.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:46.040]   So the Paradox of Choice, which if any of you read it by Barry Schwartz is a
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.160]   fantastic book.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:47.720]   I love it.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.680]   And I didn't read that book until actually, I think I read it.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.720]   His book came out in 2004.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.280]   So I'm not claiming that I invented the Paradox of Choice.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.160]   He clearly did.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.880]   He's been doing that his whole career, but I think that they have a lot of
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.920]   things in common.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:06.200]   The idea that the more choice we have, the less happy we are is very much in
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.840]   the realm of the FOMO sort of situation.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:13.800]   So I have a lot of FOMO issues and my wife and I used to struggle trying to
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.480]   figure out where we'd go for dinner.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.040]   And my solution, which I'm sure is not the best solution was I printed off a
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.560]   list of like 12 cuisines and we would just pass it between each other and we
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.680]   each had to cross one off.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.040]   And then finally we'd get to the end and we were like, okay, tonight we're
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.160]   having Indian food.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.600]   And I feel like when I go to a restaurant, I'm in a similar mindset where
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.280]   sometimes if it's like a single use menu, I asked for a pen and I start
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.240]   crossing things off until I try to land on something.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.080]   And rationally, I'm like, you know what, if I just looked at what I thought
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.280]   were the top three things and just picked one, I would probably enjoy this
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.880]   dinner experience better because I didn't spend my whole time stressing out
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.320]   about what to pick.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.800]   But I have this burning desire that I think, unfortunately, is coupled very
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.560]   heavily with my optimization personality and probably why I started this
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.200]   podcast.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.520]   But to get the most optimal outcome, to save the most money, to have the best
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.600]   experience, and there are probably circumstances where that matters and
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.320]   some that aren't and circumstances where it doesn't matter at all.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.120]   How can you help me?
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.880]   Okay, this is really good.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.920]   And by the way, I love that we're having this conversation because
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:22.920]   optimization is a good thing, but it can be incredibly crippling.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:27.800]   And I am also an optimizer.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.040]   I also have a crazy amount of FOBO.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.720]   That's the reason I came up with the word because I was like, that is me.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:40.840]   And I have seen, though, when FOBO gets out of control and it gets really
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.600]   messed up, it can ruin people's lives.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.480]   And I'm happy to tell you some stories about what I've seen.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.160]   But here's the thing.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.640]   And I did a TED video about this, a TED Talk video about my decision-making
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.680]   methodology that I've been using now for my entire adult life.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.800]   When I make decisions, I classify them into three areas, three buckets.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.760]   High stakes, low stakes, and no stakes.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.880]   High stakes decisions are ones that need real due diligence and real work and
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.800]   a structured process.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.640]   It's like, where should I go to college?
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.600]   Should I change a job?
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.160]   Things like that.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:19.160]   Low stakes decisions are things that require some judgment, but I won't
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.640]   remember really having decided about these things in about a month's time.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.800]   So it's things like, which printer should I buy?
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.600]   Which hotel should I stay at?
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.480]   Stuff like that.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.320]   So it's like there is some money involved.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.440]   There's an investment.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:37.800]   You want to work well, but you don't need to spend your whole life making a
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.760]   decision.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.680]   And then there's what's called no stakes decisions.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.880]   Those are things that you literally won't remember having decided in three
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.200]   days.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.440]   Could you tell me what you had for dinner three nights ago in your
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.400]   decision-making process?
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.920]   Could you do it?
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.640]   Probably not.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.360]   There you go.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:50.600]   Okay.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:56.200]   So when you have a no stakes decision, and I used to be that guy, I'd go to a
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.000]   restaurant.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.280]   I mean, you know how New Yorkers are too.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.640]   Everybody's like, well, they try to customize their order in every way.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.240]   Can I have a salad, but hold the kale?
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.680]   And also, can you add back the kale?
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.880]   And all that sort of stuff.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.520]   When I have a no stakes decision, I simply outsource.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:14.600]   When I go to a restaurant, I will say, I don't eat this and this, but I eat
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.560]   everything else.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.520]   You decide what we're going to have.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.200]   If I had a strong feeling about it, I would express that opinion.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:25.480]   But if I'm in the FOBO space, then I take myself and the drama out of it.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.840]   So that's how I deal with that.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.280]   When it's a low stakes decision, which is something that has some relative
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.960]   importance, I outsource it to people.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.880]   So I will say, you know, say I'm buying that printer.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.600]   Like I have a friend who knows all about that stuff.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.920]   I'll say to him, I want to buy a printer.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.200]   I need basic functionality.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.480]   I want it to be less than $300.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.200]   What do you think?
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.080]   And this is the guy who sends you three links to Amazon, you know, and then
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.120]   basically decides for you.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:54.200]   Because when you go on Amazon, there's like 973 printers and they all look the
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.000]   same.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.320]   So I just find a person who has some expertise and I outsource to them.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.600]   It's kind of like having a travel agent.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.040]   If you were doing travel, stuff like that.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.480]   And then for the high stakes, I do it myself, but I, you know, I engage with
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.960]   other people and I have a whole structure process that I read about in the book.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.440]   But that outsourcing piece and people notice it.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:10.840]   It's funny.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.000]   People are like, Patrick, you always go with the flow.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.440]   You don't make decisions about these things.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.520]   And I'm like, yeah, it's not that I'm not decisive.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:21.160]   It's that I am freeing up my time and space and energy for things that matter.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.120]   And these just don't.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.480]   And if they did matter and I did have an opinion, I would know it and I would
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.320]   express that opinion, but I just don't care.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:33.480]   Are there any other tactics if you're in that middle ground?
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.000]   I think the low stakes decisions seem like the toughest ones for me.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.040]   You know, I'm thinking the hotel is a great example and I have the exact
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:47.000]   problem you're talking about where it's, there are so many hotels and they're
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.560]   probably all fine above a certain category.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:54.600]   And I could outsource that, but I still have this feeling of, gosh, the person I
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.920]   outsource this to, what if they didn't think about this?
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.120]   What if they didn't think about that?
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.160]   And it's still tough.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:05.320]   What's level two remedy for people who find it very difficult to even outsource
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.280]   those decisions?
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:13.000]   Well, part of it is you need to sort of do the work of accepting the fact that
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.040]   you're being incredibly obstructionist to your own happiness.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.480]   You really are.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.640]   Because again, this is all perception.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.320]   You go on a website, there's three hotels.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.440]   You start worrying about all of these things.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.720]   You have no idea whether even these things, like, even if you ask every
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.760]   question in the book, you would never really know until you got there.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:32.920]   Right?
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:38.200]   So like you are creating a mental model that is flawed because you somehow
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.760]   assume that by doing additional research, you are somehow going to make a better
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.400]   decision.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.840]   And what is interesting about that, and the research shows this, this is a
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.080]   really fascinating point from Barry Schwartz's book, is that people who,
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.840]   there's what's this terms that are called maximizer of satisficer.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.520]   Maximizers are people who do all the research and they, you know, spend a
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.200]   crazy amount of time and energy to make the perfect decision.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.560]   Satisficers are people like me who say, you know, it's good enough.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.120]   Like once we get to good enough, I'm going to move on with my life because I
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.400]   got stuff to do.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:15.000]   In the end, maximizers actually make better decisions.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.560]   They are able to, through their additional work, make a better decision.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:24.840]   However, they are less happy with their decision because they spend so much
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.680]   time researching every aspect that they spend a lot of their time focusing on
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.880]   the other road they didn't take.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:34.280]   And so a big part of why you're feeling FOBO is because you are feeling
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.080]   anticipated regret at what you didn't choose.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.960]   And so, you know, I think that's where you start in terms of the work.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.800]   And it's not like a hack per se, because it's more about being in the mindset
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:51.880]   to recognize like, I am engaging in a type of behavior that is, at the end of
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.320]   the day, extremely unproductive.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:01.720]   And once you do that and you start to think like, will I even remember this?
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.360]   Then, you know, then you will be free.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:08.280]   And the reality of decisions and the thing that people don't think about is
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.560]   decisions are like doors.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.560]   If you never walk through the first door, you can't see what's inside the room
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.120]   and then go through the next door and so on and so forth in your life.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.520]   With decisions, if you can't make a basic decision, you don't open the door
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.160]   to the next set of things you're going to have to deal with.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.160]   And so that's really important.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.840]   But I think, you know, in terms of like a specific thing with hotels, again, I
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.920]   think it's about trying to think of the people that you know or the sources that
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.680]   you know that are going to offer you the best advice and then going with them
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.240]   and recognizing that you are taking the thing about decision.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.280]   Every decision is a risk.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.400]   You are taking risks, but there is no perfect decision.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.280]   It doesn't exist.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.960]   And I think realizing that going in is really helpful.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.760]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:55.480]   You mentioned earlier one of the abundance of choice is in the job world.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.360]   There's so many jobs and that is a high stakes decision.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.680]   I think right now there are a lot of jobs.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.520]   There's a lot of, you know, I've driven by, you know, at every level of the
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:11.640]   spectrum, there are people dying to get workers and there's a thing going on
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.920]   right now, at least that I've read a little bit about the great resignation
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:19.560]   that all these people who have been locked up in the one job for, you know,
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.200]   the last year or two because it's been COVID and they haven't really made a
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.240]   lot of change.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.960]   They're all going to go find something better.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:31.720]   Is that something you think is driven by this kind of FOBO and FOMO all kind of
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.600]   meshed into one?
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.360]   Do you think this is a real thing?
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.720]   I've read that up to 40% of people are going to change jobs this next year.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.000]   I'm curious to get your thoughts.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.040]   I have been thinking a lot about the great resignation as well.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:50.040]   In fact, I did a whole podcast episode on it because it is a fascinating trend.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.960]   I think in the month of April alone, 4 million people quit their jobs.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.200]   And I just see it in my, I'm sure you have friends too.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.840]   Like I have all these friends who are unemployed right now and they're like
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.120]   living their best life.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.760]   And, you know, why do all unemployed people go to Joshua Tree?
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.240]   That's a mystery to me, but I've noticed it.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:11.160]   And so maybe somebody can write us the answer, but it is, I think what's
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.000]   happening there is a couple of things.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.600]   If I put on my sort of like demographics sociologist hat, number one is I think
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.200]   a lot, and there's a really good episode of This American Life that actually
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.640]   looked at the great resignation.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.600]   So I'm sort of taking a page out of their notes.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:34.600]   People recognized during the last year and a half, if their company really,
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.960]   truly cared about them.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:40.200]   And this kind of reminds me in 2008, I was in the middle of the financial
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.560]   crisis and it was awful.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.560]   I was at AIG and my whole career blew up.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:48.760]   And what happened to me in that moment was I realized that my company didn't
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.120]   care about me at all.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.640]   And it was incapable of caring for me for so many reasons.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.880]   And I lost faith in the company and kind of in the corporate world in general.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.400]   Like I was, I was like, as good, I was like, you know, like the way that
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.720]   somebody is like a good Catholic, I was like a good corporatist.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.840]   And I believed in the whole institution and then I didn't anymore.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.640]   And I thought it was deeply flawed and bad for me.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:13.960]   And I think people feel that way about employers, the ones that didn't show,
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.040]   you know, much caring for them.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.440]   I think people also recognize the fragility of life much as I did after 9/11
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.240]   when I went to business school and, you know, felt all the FOMO.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.800]   People, you know, we have been through such a deeply scarring experience as
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.400]   a society that people are just like, life's too short to put up with this
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.680]   malarkey as like Joe Biden would say.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:39.240]   Now, all of that aside, here's the problem.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.800]   And this is where it gets nasty.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:47.240]   Chris, have you ever been unemployed for like a long period of time?
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.120]   Yes.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.840]   I actually also 2008 got laid off, tried to find a bunch of different side
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.640]   hustles and part-time jobs.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.760]   I wouldn't say I was like necessarily looking for a job,
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.120]   but I was not working for about a year.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.080]   So it's similar.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:03.320]   Okay.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.480]   So you'll, I think you'll appreciate this.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.720]   I quit my job on Wall Street.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.840]   I had saved like every dime I ever made.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.920]   My parents were great in teaching me to save.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.800]   So I had like years of runway.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.080]   And so I felt like, I was like, this is going to be chill.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.200]   I'm going to quit my job.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.160]   I'm going to be chill.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:21.800]   It's gonna be great.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.120]   As I started spending my money that I had saved and watched my bank account go down,
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.960]   it's stressful.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.760]   I felt bad.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.080]   It's like, I don't want to like, Oh, I don't want to have a muffin.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.440]   That's a 350.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.160]   Right.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:41.480]   And so I realized that like, even if you saved living out of your savings is like,
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:45.000]   it's very scary and awful and you don't enjoy anything.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.200]   And I was told that by a friend and I was like, that won't be me.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:48.840]   And it was me.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.000]   And so I found it really difficult.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.200]   And so that was from the very privileged position of having savings.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.240]   Like if you don't, then you're not, it's even worse.
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:35:59.400]   Right.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.600]   And so what I fear for people, it's like when you quit your job, I remember I felt joy,
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.600]   like a deep and abiding joy every day.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.960]   I'd wake up and I'd like, like, it was like out of like an animated movie, like a bird
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.800]   would land on my shoulder and I'd like sing to it.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.520]   I was so happy.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.920]   And I was just, I was like, I feel so free.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.800]   And that feelings, they last for a while, actually.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.480]   They're shockingly powerful.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:24.200]   But then eventually over time they fade because, you know, you get used to it like anything
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:24.920]   else.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.200]   And then the fear and the insecurity and the, Oh my God, what am I going to do?
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:28.840]   Am I going to find another job?
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.800]   All that sort of stuff comes in.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.640]   And that is what I fear for people who quit.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:39.400]   And so what I encourage people to do, rather than up and quit your job, is find a way to,
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.440]   you know, if you want to try something new, if you're like, I always want to be a chef.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.680]   And right now I'm a programmer.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:49.000]   And instead of just quitting your job and going to cooking school, do some diligence
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.760]   into whether you even like, this is FOMO, like perception or deception.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.120]   Maybe you like cooking at home.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.320]   Do you want to cook every day?
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.000]   946 people come to your restaurant.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.360]   Like a lot of the things that feel so attractive to us, if we actually dug into them, we would
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.480]   not enjoy it professionally.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.920]   And I remember reading this article in the New York Times about this woman who was a
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.640]   lawyer, a corporate lawyer, and all she wanted to do was bake.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.640]   And she quit her job and opened a bakery.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.840]   And you know what she realized?
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.720]   She hated it.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.640]   And she would dream about being a lawyer again while she was baking her cookies.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.000]   So you just want to know that.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.960]   I think it's really, and if you are going to quit, have a very structured plan about
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.240]   how you're going to live and what you're going to spend money on and how you're going to
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.520]   sort of manage the finances.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.920]   Because if you go in with a solid plan, I think you're much better positioned.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.760]   - Yeah, that makes total sense.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:41.960]   And I've actually read that a massive number of kids nowadays say that they want to be
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.760]   entrepreneurs.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:48.600]   And you wrote a book about this 10% entrepreneur concept, which I think is fascinating because
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.240]   most people don't realize what it really takes until you experience it.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.960]   And I know I kind of saw entrepreneurship with rose-colored glasses before going full
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.800]   force into running a company and managing a team and trying to find customers and trying
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.880]   to make it work and ultimately realizing it didn't.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:11.240]   Do you think that is a framework for people who have something they want to pursue, but
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.920]   feel they need to pursue it full-time because that's just the norm?
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:20.520]   Is there a way to kind of overcome that feeling of, "Oh, I have to quit my job to go bake."
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:25.160]   But is there a way to just kind of adopt this 10% lifestyle easily?
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.920]   Or what's a process for doing that?
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:33.560]   - So we're all sold this bill of goods that, you know, unless you're suffering and in pain,
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.120]   as an entrepreneur, you can't succeed.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.440]   And you see it all the time.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:46.360]   Like there's a whole entrepreneurship porn kind of industry, like grinding really hard.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.960]   And people are realizing that's kind of all BS.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:55.800]   But it is still a cultural thing that unless you're bleeding, somehow you didn't play hard
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.200]   enough.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.080]   And that's just not me.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:05.080]   And so when I left Wall Street, I was like, "Oh man, I should be an entrepreneur because
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.160]   it's the way to go."
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.720]   And I have a lot of friends who are entrepreneurs, but I didn't have the guts to just jump into
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.520]   one thing.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.200]   Especially after the AIG debacle, I was like, "I want to be diversified.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.760]   I want to have a much more portfolio approach."
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:24.760]   And, you know, as I started to do all these things on the side, I realized actually this
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.480]   is pretty amazing because you can have sort of like a steady income stream from stuff,
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.960]   but then you can kind of up, you know, sort of put 10% of your time, money, and energy
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.760]   into very high risk things that, you know, potentially have high reward.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.040]   And it's also a great way to try an idea.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.760]   And then if you like that, you could then scale up, you know, you don't have to stay
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.120]   at 10%, you can go 50, 100.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.920]   In fact, many of the people that I interviewed for my book started at 10%, figured out the
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.480]   idea worked.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.400]   Like, you know, they did their minimum viable product.
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:55.240]   They got some paying customers and then they went to their company and said, "Hey, I have
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.360]   this startup.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.800]   Can I work one day a week on it?
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.400]   Or can I work three days a week on it?"
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.960]   And, you know, companies need good people.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.160]   So they were pretty amenable.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.760]   And then over the course of a period of time, then they ended up going full time.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.240]   So I think it's a really sensible thing to do.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:14.040]   It also, the statistics show us, there was a study out of University of Wisconsin that
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:19.480]   people who start something on the side and then go full time are 50% more likely to succeed
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.760]   than people who just jump in because they give themselves the runway to fail and make
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.840]   mistakes before they have to live off the business.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.160]   So it makes a lot of sense.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.920]   I mean, it doesn't work for every business model.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.440]   If it's super capital intensive, like that's not going to make a lot of sense for you because
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.400]   you need to raise money and investors aren't going to back you if you're a part-timer.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.480]   But I think it's really sensible.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.400]   And the reality is that many businesses that we all know were started as 10%, you know,
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.440]   Apple was started as 10%.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:47.480]   Jobs in Western Europe were working at HP and they started it in their cubicle.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.000]   You know, the garage story is a lie.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.520]   It's like it was made up.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.800]   And I think it's, I've done it now for a really long time.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:59.240]   I know many people who do it and I think it's an incredible way to make your career way
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:40:59.880]   more interesting.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.100]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:05.640]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.440]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:19.960]   Okay.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.240]   So you've got Hacks for FOMO.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.880]   You've got Hacks for Manifesting Entrepreneurship Without Having to Quit Your Job.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.000]   I know you'd emailed me and said, "You've got lots of hacks.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.080]   What else is in your arsenal of things people can use to improve life, improve work or anything
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.200]   around that area?"
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.120]   So I have a funny hack.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.160]   Well, I think it's funny.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:44.520]   You might not, but I'm going to say it anyway because it makes life just a little more interesting
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.000]   and fun.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.360]   And I think it has some benefits.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.320]   Whenever I go to a restaurant and I put my name down, I say my name is Pierre.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.840]   Now, can you guess why I do that?
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:56.760]   I don't know because French people are great at food.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.080]   Yeah, I always think that if my name is Pierre, they'll assume that I have higher standards
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.000]   than the average person and treat me better.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.720]   And do you think it works?
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.120]   I do.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.800]   I feel like I get tables much more quickly.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.320]   The only downside of it is that nobody knows how to spell Pierre.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.520]   They spell it P-I-E-R, Pierre.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.360]   So that's kind of weird.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.640]   But it's not that offensive if your fake name is misspelled.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.840]   Yeah, that's one.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:28.360]   Another one that I really love, this has actually been a transformative hack for me, is do you
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:28.840]   meditate?
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:34.600]   It's one of those things that I've seen value from and I've gone off and on, but I've never
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.240]   been able to make it a habit that kind of lasts.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.480]   Why do you think?
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:44.280]   I think, I mean, I had Laura Vanderkam, who's written a lot about productivity, came on
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.720]   the podcast and kind of challenged the idea that you don't have time for something.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.320]   It's like, no, you haven't prioritized it.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:55.400]   So I can't say I don't have time for it, but I'd say I haven't continually prioritized
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:55.960]   it.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:01.240]   And it's one of those things that I think it's hard to see the tangible, immediate
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.720]   benefit, but it's easier to see the long-term benefit.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:08.680]   So on any given day, it's like, "Well, if I don't do it today, it's probably going to
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.080]   be fine."
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.840]   And then that just kind of snowballs into not doing it for weeks at a time.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.240]   And then it kind of just stops being a routine.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:15.720]   Totally.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.760]   That's exactly right.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.120]   That's exactly how I was.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.280]   My brother has been meditating for a really long time, and I saw the effect on him.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.320]   I was amazed at his resilience, his ability to deal with when bad things happen.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.840]   He just was so, I don't know, grounded.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:39.160]   And I wanted that, and I couldn't get it.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.280]   I tried.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.960]   I even went to this thing with him, and I didn't like the style or the people, so it
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:44.520]   wasn't for me.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:49.880]   But I would start going to classes, and I realized many other things in the world.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.320]   There's no one way to do things.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:56.680]   If somebody tells you you're meditating wrong, it's not like that.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.360]   There's many different ways to achieve that objective and many different styles of
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:00.840]   meditation.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.560]   So I thought that was a good thing to know.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.560]   But still, I couldn't do it.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.800]   I would do it once a week or something.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.600]   And then I recognized that I really needed it.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.640]   And about three years ago, I was at brunch with a friend of mine, this guy Ajay Kishore,
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:16.680]   who is an entrepreneur.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.960]   And he and I were kind of new friends at the time.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.960]   And it was right at the end of the year.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.680]   And he was like, "Do you have any New Year's resolutions?"
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.400]   And I was like, "No, I don't actually believe in New Year's resolutions.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.720]   I think they're not for me."
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:33.880]   In fact, anytime I start something new in the beginning of the year, I start it on the
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:39.240]   2nd of January so that I've already broken my resolution, the little thing I do.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.000]   I've done that since I was a child.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.560]   But I said, "I really want to meditate."
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.000]   And he said, "Me too."
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.200]   And so what we did is we created an accountability pact.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:56.280]   And every day for the last three years, I go on this app called Habit Share.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.080]   I love the app.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.120]   I should reach out to them, actually, because it's not a fancy app.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.160]   It is so no-frills.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:09.320]   But you just go and you create a habit pact with somebody, and you both sign up.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.400]   And then every day when you check in that you've done the thing, it sends a notification
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.120]   to the other person.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.880]   So I started that.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.680]   And I started at five minutes a day.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.120]   So I didn't try to go hardcore.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.320]   Five minutes a day.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:25.480]   And then it was 5.10, 5.20, 5.30, so on, up to 10 minutes, which is what I do today.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.960]   And I have done that now.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:33.400]   I have missed three days in the entire year so far.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.240]   I didn't miss a day last year.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.200]   I'm also very competitive.
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:41.000]   So I call it competitive meditation, because it's sort of like, I mean, it's ridiculous,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.840]   but it's true, because I want to have my stats be perfect.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:50.120]   But even though that's kind of whack and not in line with the spirit of why you meditate,
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.680]   I will say I do it every day.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.200]   And I think it's much more important to be every day than to worry about how long you
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:56.600]   did it for.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.840]   I had this friend who started meditating.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.160]   And he was like, "Well, you don't do it long enough.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.360]   You have to do this much time."
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.200]   And I was like, "Okay."
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.960]   And then, of course, he doesn't meditate ever.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.680]   He's completely fallen off the wagon, because it wasn't sustainable.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.520]   And I also plan it into my day.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.320]   I have it on my calendar.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.760]   I look in for a spot of my day, and I know going into the day when I'm going to do it.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.920]   So I encourage you.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.760]   By the way, you can join my accountability group if you want, Chris, if you want to take
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:26.840]   it on, because it will, especially you, I can tell, you're not going to be cool having
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:27.640]   crappy stats.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.600]   And so you will make time for it.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.000]   And it is amazing, because at the end of the day, what it has done for me, and I'm not
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.040]   like some new-agey guy.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:36.920]   That's just not me.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.680]   I'm just like a practical person.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:43.320]   But it has really sapped me of my ability to freak out and get angry about anything.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.040]   I just can't.
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.360]   Like, I'm much more low-key, calm.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:50.840]   I'm still outgoing and fun, but I just can't get mad at somebody.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.880]   Like, I don't freak out.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.320]   So that's good.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.920]   That's amazing.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.480]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:01.480]   I can actually see my Peloton in this room, and I was thinking about how the Peloton,
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:06.440]   the reason that I used it for so long, and now, of course, I'm going to have to take
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.920]   a break here, was to be competitive with people.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:14.120]   And I loved the feeling of texting someone after and being like, "I just beat your
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.480]   record on that ride."
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.880]   And then I was like, "Oh man, Peloton actually does meditation.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.760]   Why haven't they come up with their version of competitive meditation?"
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.400]   But I feel like maybe it takes away the spirit.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:28.600]   But if I need to use HabitShare, competitive meditation sounds like a great way to get
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.160]   back into it.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.640]   You're very welcome.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.840]   Anybody listening is welcome.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.560]   If you reach out to me at Let's Connect with Patrick McGinnis, you can join my group.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:40.120]   But if you join me, and then you don't do it, and you're always missing it, I will
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.680]   kick you out.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:44.040]   Because I'm not here to see bad stats.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.080]   I want excellence.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.920]   That's awesome.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.120]   Any other final hacks?
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:53.160]   Oh man, well, this is not so much of a hack, but it's something that I did that really
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:58.200]   was life-changing as well for me that I would encourage everybody to do, which is get yourself
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.800]   a proper setup for your home office.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.000]   I have been working for myself for a decade.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.720]   I worked off of a laptop for nine years.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.560]   And then when I moved into this new place that I moved into this year, I got myself
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.680]   an extra large screen.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.920]   I got the trackpad, the wireless one.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.120]   I got the wireless keyboard.
[00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:18.440]   I got a really good webcam, much better than the one that's on my laptop.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.880]   I got a nice light, a ring light, because it's 2021.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.560]   So you want to look good.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.760]   And I invested in all of that.
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:29.240]   And what it has done for me is radically improved my productivity.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:34.440]   And also I enjoy sitting at that desk, working off a laptop.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.920]   And now when I do it, by the way, I hate it.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.680]   If I'm at a coffee shop on my laptop, I'm like, "How did I do this for so many years?"
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:45.480]   And so it's just better for your health, but it also just makes your work better.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.200]   And so I encourage people to make that investment.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.360]   And by the way, I was actually, this was kind of crazy.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.600]   It was so much cheaper than I could have ever thought to get all of this stuff together.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.760]   You know, stuff is just really cheap now.
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.720]   And so, you know, you're not going to break the bank to do it.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:05.000]   I have a setup and now I can't really work on a laptop, which actually is good.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.640]   While I might not leave my phone out of the bedroom, I often never use my computer in
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.040]   the bedroom because I'm like, "No, no, I want to work at my desk.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.600]   I don't want to work on a laptop in the bed or on a couch."
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.040]   So I totally agree.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.920]   I just think like, I'm like, "I really want to look at Twitter.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.960]   I'm going to sit at my desk."
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.880]   That's why I run over there.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:24.600]   It's so sad.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:30.680]   But I will say there are a lot of companies and they may or may not publish this.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.200]   You may want to reach out.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:37.240]   But I've heard of a lot of friends whose companies were willing to help pay for something to
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.920]   make their office setup good.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.240]   So even if there's not a formal policy, I would reach out to your manager or your HR
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:47.480]   team and say, "Hey, is there any room in the budget for me to upgrade my desk?"
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.880]   "Upgrade my chair, get a monitor, get a light."
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:55.240]   And I would be surprised if most people couldn't get someone to pay for something to make their
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:59.400]   experience better, especially because a more productive employee is a better employee for
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.200]   the company as well.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.080]   That's a smart idea.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.040]   All right.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.400]   This is awesome.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.040]   Gosh, you have so many things going on.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.480]   Where should people find everything you're working on right now?
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:09.880]   All right.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:14.840]   So first of all, everybody, this is a momentous week in the history of podcasting because
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.600]   me and Chris are going on each other's shows.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:23.800]   So Chris kindly had me on his show and he is coming over to FOMO Sapiens, which is my
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.640]   show at FOMOSapiens.com.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   And so you can find that wherever you get podcasts and smash that subscribe button for
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.280]   all the goodies.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.720]   That's number one.
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:38.760]   Number two, if you want to learn more about my work, you can also check out PatrickMcGinnis.com.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:44.440]   And the links to all the socials, I have a really, I think it's a pretty cool Instagram
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.880]   @PatrickJMcGinnis.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:48.920]   And as you've probably just heard a million times, I love Twitter.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.040]   So I'm @PJMcGinnis.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.000]   So all of those places.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.840]   And you'll also be able to...
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:57.400]   If you're interested in 10% Entrepreneur, I've released an audio course in a podcast
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.240]   format with a company called Himalaya.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:05.960]   So if you go to Himalaya.com/parttime, you can get a free trial subscription and check
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.280]   it out.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.560]   Awesome.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:11.240]   I will link to everything here that we talked about and some of the books you mentioned
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.120]   all in the show notes.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.120]   Thank you so much for coming on.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.360]   And I'm excited to swap sides and be on the other side of the table.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.240]   Thank you so much.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.360]   It was a pleasure being here.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.640]   And yes, we will continue the conversation over a phone with Safekids.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.160]   That was fantastic.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.880]   I hope you all enjoyed this conversation as much as I did.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:33.080]   And I'll make sure to put links to everything we discussed in the show notes.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:38.440]   I'm about to kick off the process of finding the guests, scheduling and recording the next
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.800]   few months of episodes.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.880]   So if there's a topic or person you have in mind, please send me a note and I'll do my
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.640]   best to try to make it happen.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.520]   My email is chris@allthehacks.com.

[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:53.480]   this show.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:57.960]   I love getting all your emails and I'll do my best to respond to every single one.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.600]   All right.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.760]   Thank you so much for all your support.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.880]   See you next week.
