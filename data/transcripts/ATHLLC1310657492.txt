[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.920]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.040]   your life, money, and travel, all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.480]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.120]   journey to find all the hacks.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.400]   Now, in today's world, we are constantly surrounded by photos, videos,
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.520]   and more of all the amazing things everyone else is doing.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.280]   And I'd be surprised if you don't often feel the FOMO that comes with it.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.000]   I know I do.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.720]   And if you're an optimizer like me, you might also find yourself facing a fair
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.160]   amount of FOBO as well, which is a new term I learned from today's guests
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.920]   and sort of like FOMO's cousin.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.560]   It's the fear of a better option.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.600]   And it often manifests itself for me as analysis paralysis, and it can take a
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.200]   toll on even the smallest decisions.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.440]   So that's why I am so excited to be talking with Patrick McGinnis, because
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.600]   in 2004, he actually first coined the terms FOMO and FOBO.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.880]   Since then, he's been featured in the New York Times, Politico, and more.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.920]   He's given a popular TED talk on decision-making.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.320]   He's written two bestselling books, The 10% Entrepreneur, Live Your
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   Startup Dream Without Quitting Your Day Job, and most recently, Fear of Missing
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.240]   Out, Practical Decision-Making in a World of Overwhelming Choice.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.440]   Finally, he's the host of the hit podcast, FOMO Sapiens, where I will
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.360]   be joining him next week as a guest.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.440]   In our conversation, we'll talk about the history of FOMO, ways to overcome
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.240]   the toll it can have on our lives.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.040]   We'll talk about FOBO and hear Patrick's framework to vastly
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.320]   improve your decision-making.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.480]   And finally, he'll share some of his favorite life hacks.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.800]   One quick thing before we get started.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.080]   I'm considering working with a few sponsors to support the show.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.480]   They'll only be brands I believe in, and you'll be able to fast forward
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.040]   the ads if you're not interested.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.440]   But I just want to let you know in advance, and hopefully you understand,
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.280]   that it's all in service of continuing to deliver an amazing show to you each week.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.480]   All right, so let's jump in.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.440]   Patrick, thanks for being here.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.800]   It's my pleasure.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.360]   How are you?
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.200]   You know, I fractured my foot last night on the dance floor at a
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.600]   wedding, which was not fun.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.800]   Um, but you know, I'm here.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.200]   If you're going to break your foot, that's a good reason to do it.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.400]   It's either going to be athletics or dancing.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.840]   Those are the only two excuses.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.520]   Although at the hospital, I was telling people, I was like,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.320]   "Oh, they're hedges."
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.960]   I was like, "Dancing."
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.240]   They're like, "Oh, are you a professional dancer?"
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.560]   It's like, "No, I was at a dance.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.360]   I was at a wedding.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.520]   We were drinking.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.680]   The floor was slippery."
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.080]   Anyways, so you've got a word in the dictionary.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.880]   I never even thought to put that on my bucket list.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.160]   And now I'm a little jealous.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.440]   Did you ever imagine FOMO becoming such a major part of our culture
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.840]   when you first coined the term?
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.080]   I did not.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.840]   In fact, I wrote this article back in 2004, and I put it in the humor section
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.520]   of our school newspaper over at Harvard Business School, which, I mean, the fact
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.800]   I was writing for the newspaper at a business school tells you that I was
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.760]   not the usual person, I guess.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.440]   And how long did it take before you realized that you'd created this thing
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.720]   that you'd be hearing every day in the media and just in casual conversation?
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.280]   So I did a forensic analysis, actually.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:08.760]   I actually hired a person, a web forensic expert to try to understand what the
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.840]   heck happened, because I missed out on this whole thing.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.080]   I was not aware of FOMO's prominence, actually, until a
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.200]   reporter called me one day.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.840]   And he said, "You invented the word FOMO."
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.280]   And I said, "Yeah, that's true.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.840]   Why do you care?"
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.280]   And he said, "Well, it's in the dictionary."
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.160]   And I was like, "What?"
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.680]   This was in 2014, 10 years after I wrote that article.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.720]   And so when I got more involved and was working on a book about the topic, I
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.080]   decided to really get into it and try to figure out what happened and what I was
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.080]   able to reconstruct through my own research and then the work of the forensic
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.320]   person, is that my article came out in 2004.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.680]   It was the first time it was used anywhere in an article called McGinnis'
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.400]   Two Foes, Social Theory at Harvard Business School.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.760]   And then it stayed on in the school because it became very popular and it
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.400]   became a term that was used there.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.200]   And then it spread to other MBA programs.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.440]   And in 2007, three years later, Business Week wrote an article about FOMO at
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.040]   business schools.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.640]   And so that was kind of a moment and it's sort of popularity spreading.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.200]   And then in 2009, a woman called Katrina Thake, who is the founder of Flickr,
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.240]   wrote a blog post about it in reference to South by Southwest.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.840]   And sometimes people credit her with being the creator of FOMO.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.840]   And you know, it's just the internet doesn't lie.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.720]   She used the term and popularized it for sure, but it was not her creation.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.120]   And then from there, it really took off and it was admitted to the dictionary in
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.760]   2013.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.360]   Wow.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.440]   And what was the premise of the original article?
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.560]   So the article was, it's actually, I think it's a funny article still.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.800]   I like when I read it, I'm always like, I'm pleased that I wrote it.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.960]   I was like, wow, he's a much better writer than I think I imagined at the time.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:51.040]   But it's this satirical piece about the day in the life of a typical student in
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.120]   an MBA program and how they struggle to do all of these things.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.440]   And I actually give somebody's calendar, sort of like at six o'clock you go to
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.880]   drinks with friends at six 45, you go stop by a lecture at six, you know, for
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.400]   seven minutes to say hello to this one girl you met, then five minutes later,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.200]   you're off to dinner.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.000]   And then, you know, I sort of take you through and then there are four birthday
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.360]   parties and you know, you're out until three.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.760]   And so it's sort of, because that was the life that we led.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.360]   And I always, I'm from a small town in Maine called Sanford, Maine.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.800]   It's really simple.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.480]   People don't live that way.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.360]   It's a kind of place where you do like one thing a day.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.280]   And then to find myself in this really uber social environment, which was very
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.240]   much fueled by the fact that we had just come out of nine 11 and people were sort
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.080]   of like, you know, realize the fragility of life and how you have to live life to
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.440]   the fullest because it was so different than the life I had known before.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.680]   I decided I had to write an article about it because it was this, you know, I
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.960]   started using this word FOMO and I was like, I got to write about this cause
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.000]   it's like, I'm going to leave this place and go back to the normal world.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.440]   And I'm not going to have this craziness in my life anymore.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.920]   Of course, now we all have FOMO because of social media.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.080]   And funny enough, when I wrote that article, Mark Zuckerberg was a mile away
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.000]   from me on the other side of the Charles river inventing the first version of
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.600]   Facebook.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.240]   And I credit sort of him and Facebook and social media with making FOMO much more
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.960]   than a sort of high class problem, but something that all of us feel.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.080]   And, and just so we're all on the same page, you know, as the, as the term
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.480]   creator, do you have a definition that you prefer for FOMO?
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.480]   I'm sure there are many in different dictionaries.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.960]   It's a great question.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.440]   I, nobody's ever asked me that before.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.480]   And it's true.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.600]   So when I decided to write this book, I did a ton of research because I'm not a
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.240]   psychologist, nor did I ever claim to be a psychologist, but psychologists love to
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.920]   write about FOMO.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.720]   And there have been so many journal articles, like it's quite amazing to me.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.480]   Then you have a bunch of PhDs writing articles about FOMO.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.080]   It's just mind blowing.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.600]   And so I read all of them and I realized that there was no consistency in how the
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.440]   academic world and the clinical psychology world was defining FOMO.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.640]   And then I read all of the dictionary versions, obviously, and the urban
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.360]   dictionary definition as well, which is, you know, one of the first times it was
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.040]   written about actually in about 2007, I believe.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.560]   And I realized that it was all over the map.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.680]   And so I formulated a definition that is my standard definition.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.360]   And the definition is this.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:19.600]   FOMO is an anxiety often fueled by social media based on the perception that other
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.120]   people are having more beneficial experiences than you.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.360]   And it is a fear of being excluded from a beneficial collective experience.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.560]   And you said a perception.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.760]   So obviously it doesn't have to be reality to be FOMO.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.880]   Exactly.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.200]   So that's where the rubber hits the road in terms of the pathology of this whole
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   thing is its perception.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.360]   So you see something and that's why social media is so insidious.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.440]   You see something, it looks amazing, but we all know that it's filtered
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.880]   and that it's a moment in time and that the things that were being served up,
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.760]   especially on Instagram, for example, are they do not correspond to reality, but
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.120]   we don't think critically about that.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.280]   And so you see something that isn't even real, but it provokes feelings of
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.080]   inadequacy and of anxiety and stress.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.800]   And so you're spending a lot of energy focused on something that's not even
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.840]   possible.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.280]   And that's where the perception comes in.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.680]   I often, you know, the way I think about it is perception is often deception.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.440]   I have to think most people know this, right?
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.160]   Most people, if you ask them consciously are like, yeah, of course, I'm only
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.280]   seeing the best of this.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.160]   I'm seeing my friend with three kids on a vacation and they're all smiling and
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.480]   having fun and a vacation with three kids might have those moments, but it
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.200]   certainly has other moments as well.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.840]   Is there a reason that people are just kind of unable to process that reality
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.200]   when they see these images, when they hear about these things?
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.040]   And is there a way that they can avoid it?
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.640]   There is.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.800]   And, you know, I think the reality is that people know, but these companies
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.480]   that make social media networks and other things, and not just social media, of
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.200]   course, it can be in things you see on television or things you hear about in
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:01.760]   the real world.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.240]   But focusing particularly on social media is these companies are extremely
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.720]   sophisticated and they are creating habit forming applications that are designed to
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.320]   manipulate you.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.120]   You know, this is like, this is all, you know, the attention economy, as it's
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.280]   been referred to, it's all about stealing your attention and presenting you with
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.400]   things that manipulate you.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.960]   So, you know, it's not your fault.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.440]   It's not like we're all idiots.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.480]   It's that the system as it's been created is so powerful and so well done.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.800]   Now, what I tend to think and what I recommend people to do and what I do for
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.560]   myself, because I know highly susceptible, I'm the first FOMO sapiens, right?
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.840]   I am the creator of FOMO.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.840]   I feel FOMO like cripplingly and I've had to really learn how to manage that.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.800]   And so what I have done is I'm very mindful about when I use social media, how
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.560]   it makes me feel.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.880]   And for example, say I'm following some person on Facebook or something and they
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.760]   put a post up, it makes me feel inadequate or it makes me want to devalue what I
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.640]   have in my own life.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.480]   I unfollow that person.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.280]   If I'm using Instagram and it makes me feel stressed, I close it down.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.080]   I think that's the critical thing is understand why you're opening that app,
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.520]   understand what you're getting from it and understand the unintended
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.440]   consequences of the use of that app.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.480]   And if you do that, it's great because it's kind of like eating food, right?
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.840]   Like if you eat something, you just stuff it in your mouth and it doesn't make you
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.280]   feel good.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.280]   You're not going to eat more of it.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.760]   So why would you do the same thing with social media?
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.440]   I mean, if you want to get to the end of the feed, do you want to finish the
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:34.880]   plate?
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.000]   You know, I grew up in a clean plate club household.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.640]   So, you know, even if you don't like it, I feel like I have this burning desire to
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.440]   finish a meal without, without any control.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.040]   And so does that mean that you, are you someone who doesn't sleep with the phone
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.880]   on the side of the bed or do you treat your phone differently in your household
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.480]   to try to avoid some of these things?
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:01.480]   It's such a good question because I remember I read some stat, um, when I was
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:06.440]   researching and the number of people who sleep with their, their phone by the bed
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.040]   is, it's, it's mind blowing.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.320]   It's North of 80% might be North of 90%, um, these days.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.400]   And I remember, I, I mean, I, we all know these people, maybe it's you who's
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.000]   listening, who sleep with their phone under the pillow.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.200]   Do you do that?
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.920]   No, no.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.720]   I keep, I mean, I do keep it near the bed.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.760]   So here's the thing, not, not good, but about the phone, right?
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.240]   So the phone, they're smart.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.400]   Like it's, again, it's like really well-designed kind of stuff.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.040]   Like the phone manufacturers and designers put an alarm clock on the
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.240]   phone and that's the Trojan horse.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.720]   Cause you're like, it's very reliable.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.840]   And so you want to have the phone near you.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.720]   So you have the alarm clock.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.880]   That's why a lot of people started the culture of bringing
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.640]   the phone into the bedroom.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.000]   And once you do that, then you've let it into your personal
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.920]   space and then you're done.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.840]   And so what I learned, I used to do that myself.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.320]   And then I decided a number of years ago to leave it in the other room.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.600]   And I found it had a tremendous benefit for me.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.800]   And then I was given this phone bed.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.160]   Ariana Huffington actually makes these phone beds.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.360]   Like you tuck your phone into a little bed at the end of the day.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.520]   It's really cute actually.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.560]   And so she gave me one of those.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.200]   So I use that now for my phone.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.680]   Are there other habits to adopt that help lighten?
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.840]   I guess now that I have a noun for it, since FOMO is an
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.480]   anxiety to lighten that anxiety.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.400]   So a couple of things that I would recommend people to do.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.200]   Number one is you need to monitor your phone use and all of our phones have
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.640]   these digital wellness suites now that are built into them.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.120]   And so I take a good look every week at how I'm spending my time online.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.920]   It's just helpful to be mindful of like, Oh my goodness.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.880]   Why did I spend 43 minutes a day on Instagram?
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.080]   Like, what did that give me and why did I pick that up?
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.920]   So just thinking about the root cause of why you engage in social media,
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.200]   it's really important to do.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.680]   Another thing that I recommend people to do is if you find that you're
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.840]   unable to control your use of a certain site, like there's a site called
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.560]   political wire that is very addictive and I love it, but it makes me feel bad.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.520]   So I have a rule that I'm only allowed to look at that site when I'm at a
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.640]   desktop and not on my phone.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.560]   And that really helps me to cut down on my usage.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.400]   It's just like a rule I have.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.080]   I'm not allowed to look at Twitter either on my phone and I don't do that.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.480]   And when I slip up, I noticed that my quality of life goes down dramatically.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.560]   And then there are some other hacks that I don't have any
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.200]   distractive apps on my front page.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.040]   I have to go into a folder to find them.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.520]   And so I create sort of a barrier and that makes it a bit hard to use them.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.360]   And the other thing that some people do, which I have not chosen to do,
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.240]   but some find helpful is to put your phone in grayscale.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.280]   And I'm actually going to try, I have a little hack I'm going to try now.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.560]   I'm announcing this to the world today on your show.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.560]   I'm going to buy the iPhone mini because it is my view that if you have a smaller
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.520]   phone, you are less likely to want to pick it up all the time and look at stuff
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.960]   because it's just, let's, you know, it's less of a in your face kind of thing.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.640]   Like the bigger the screen, the more the temptation is to watch a video
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.520]   and you know, all that sort of stuff.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.680]   I don't want, I want less fun in my life, a lot more.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.360]   And so I'm going to get a smaller phone.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.200]   I like that.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.840]   I mean, you could go all the way back and get a, an old like Motorola
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.560]   razor that can't do anything.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.840]   I'm not interested in that.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.320]   It's a fascinating concept because I, I know people who have done that.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.720]   My view with all of this stuff is it's not about abstinence.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.360]   It's about sort of having a healthy diet.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.040]   Like if you're trying to lose weight and you just don't eat anything for days and
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.160]   days, that's not sustainable.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.400]   It's not healthy.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   And also it's not fun.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.320]   Right.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.800]   And so I would much more be interested in changing my diet to something that I can,
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.120]   you know, learn to enjoy.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.520]   Like I used to be, I lost like 50 pounds in high school.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.600]   I used to eat bacon double cheeseburgers every Friday night and a Boston cream pie.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.280]   I mean, that was what I thought I liked.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.680]   And nowadays I have a much healthier diet and I enjoy that and I don't want Boston
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.640]   green pie actually.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.200]   Like if you gave me Boston green pie, I would say I'm good.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:58.680]   Right.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.280]   And so I think it has to be that with the way that we think about how we engage with
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:03.720]   technology.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:10.200]   It seems like with every business you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:10.760]   emerge.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.280]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many manual
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.840]   processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:24.080]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025 one.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.000]   37,000 that's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.400]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.

[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:32.280]   allthehacks.com/netsuite, N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.760]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.920]   for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.360]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.800]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:55.040]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.360]   year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.600]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.480]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.640]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.960]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.760]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-Erh
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.640]   for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-Erh, which helps kickstart digestion
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.400]   and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.680]   favorite things to drink.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.720]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed benefits
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.120]   of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.440]   happy that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.840]   world, but you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.240]   free US shipping, free returns, and a money backed guarantee.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:59.040]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.840]   samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.120]   That's P-I-Q-U-E.

[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.680]   Now we talked a lot about technology.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.160]   You did a lot of research for the book.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.400]   Is this a new phenomenon, right?
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.320]   You talked about it before there was social media.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.720]   How do you think the concept of FOMO has evolved?
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.240]   So FOMO is part of the experience of being a human.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.640]   It goes back to the earliest humans.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.640]   And I did a bunch of research on sort of evolutionary biology.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:40.640]   The fact that the earliest humans were keenly aware of what they needed and what
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.880]   they didn't have in order to survive.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.040]   So, you know, they ran with the pack.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.480]   You know, you stayed in the group because if you weren't in the group, you didn't
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.760]   get the information about where the best water was, where the best food was, where
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.000]   you should do your migratory pattern, where there's good shelter, and also you're
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.360]   more vulnerable to attack.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.800]   And in fact, if you've ever been to Africa and seen the migration of the wildebeest,
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.360]   or just Google it if you haven't had a shot to go there, because it's really
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:11.680]   quite incredible, the wildebeest migrate across the Serengeti and they stick in a
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.320]   herd and it's called a swarm migration because if one gets separated, then it'll
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.760]   get attacked and the predators will eat them.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.400]   But if they stick together, maybe they get one, but they don't kill them all off.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.960]   And so it's part of their evolutionary biology to stick with the crap.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.360]   So it was part of how we survived physically.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.080]   It has evolved into something much more emotional over time.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.120]   And one of the cool things that I realized in my research, this is like one of the
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.360]   most crazy things that ever happened to me in my life, which is that the term
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.840]   keeping up with the Joneses, that is sort of analog FOMO.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:51.680]   It was a comic strip from a hundred years ago in the New York Globe newspaper about
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.200]   this family that lived next to this Jones family.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.840]   And they were trying to keep up with them all the time.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.840]   And it was like, you know, Oh, Mr.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.440]   Jones is like wearing a red tie, dad, you got to get a red tie.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.880]   And it's not like the most humorous thing I've ever read, but the name of the
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.000]   family that's feeling all this FOMO is the McGinnis family.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.960]   So I have a fictional ancestor who invented FOMO.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.960]   Somebody wrote that in a paper actually, and they tied him to me, which was, I
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.600]   couldn't believe it.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.800]   I still kind of blows my mind, but I guess the point of all that is that it is
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.040]   something that we've always had.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.920]   The difference is that we think about core drivers of FOMO, you know, it's things
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.000]   like information, the quantity of information you're receiving, right?
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.400]   So that you have more data points.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.160]   It's the ability to compare yourself with others.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.200]   The more interconnected we are, the more we can see what other people are doing.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.960]   And so over time, just the amount of people that are in your daily sort of
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.320]   experience has gone through the roof, especially with social media.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:54.640]   And so, you know, if you were living a hundred years ago in my hometown in Maine,
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.240]   you didn't really know what was going on outside of there.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.080]   You were served up very specific elements of FOMO, like a cigarette commercial or
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.240]   something where celebrities are like smoking so beautiful, like, isn't this
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:04.560]   great?
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.400]   Like we love cigarettes and maybe you were susceptible, but now it's like
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.320]   everything you do, you're being served up this content.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.640]   You said something earlier about the abundance of information.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.560]   And it reminded me that your original article was actually about two things.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.800]   It wasn't just FOMO.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.080]   It was this thing, FOBO, which since getting to know you, I learned as a thing.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:30.040]   And I actually think could possibly, and I'm curious your perspective, be an even
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:35.520]   more difficult or bigger strain on people's days, especially when it comes to
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.640]   work and not just social life.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:43.520]   How do you compare the two and especially the relative impact they have on society
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.280]   and people's lives?
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.680]   So FOBO stands for fear of a better option.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.800]   And it's the idea that when you have to make a decision and you have perfectly
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.880]   acceptable things in front of you, that you are sort of holding out for the
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.400]   riskless option, like the perfect thing.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.560]   And so you're like, well, you know, I'm just going to wait until it's so clear
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.320]   to me that this thing is the right decision.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.760]   And so people, you know, sort of delay and it's really, it's an affliction of
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:15.280]   abundance in an affluent society where you have everything you need, then you
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.280]   can get stuck in this place.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.040]   Like if you don't have options, whether it's food, if you don't have sufficient
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.520]   food, you're not going to be like, well, let's see, I don't know what to have
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:22.720]   today.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.040]   You're going to be like, I'm going to eat whatever I can get.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.400]   Right.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.880]   If you live in a place where the economy is terrible and there's no jobs, you're
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.040]   not going to be like interviewing for 17 jobs and waiting for the, it's just,
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.960]   you're not going to do that.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.840]   And so I think it's much more damaging than FOMO for the simple reason that FOMO
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.560]   does have positive aspects.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:47.000]   FOMO can be a tremendous and powerful motivator of human behavior if used in
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.520]   the right ways.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:54.840]   Um, FOBO is just bad because you don't decide on things and you are once again,
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.320]   the sort of mired in the perception that there's something better that's going to
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:58.800]   come for you.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.000]   And as you wait for that perfect thing, the exceptional options that you have in
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.720]   front of you right now may disappear and you'll end up with nothing.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   And so I always think of FOMO like drinking wine, a little wine is great,
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.080]   loosens you up, maybe try something new dance on that dance floor.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.800]   Don't break your foot too much wine.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.480]   You know, you're not going to feel good the next day.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.840]   FOMO is like smoking cigarettes, bad for you, bad for everybody around you feels
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.520]   good, sure, but nothing good for you.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:31.200]   And is FOMO directly linked or maybe even a synonym to analysis paralysis or how do
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.720]   you, are those similar?
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.760]   They are.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.320]   So the paradox of choice, which if any of you read it by Barry Schwartz is a
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.480]   fantastic book.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.040]   I love it.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.080]   And I didn't read that book until actually, I think I read it.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.000]   His book came out in 2004.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.600]   So I'm not claiming that I invented the paradox of choice.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.440]   He clearly did.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.480]   He's been doing that his whole career, but I think that they have a lot of things in
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:58.280]   common, the idea that the more choice we have, the less happy we are is very much
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.800]   in the realm of the FOMO sort of situation.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.440]   So I have a lot of FOMO issues and my wife and I used to struggle trying to figure out
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.360]   where we'd go for dinner.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.760]   And my solution, which I'm sure is not the best solution was I printed off a list of
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.240]   like 12 cuisines and we would just pass it between each other and we each had to
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.000]   cross one off.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.400]   Uh, and then finally we'd get to the end and we were like, okay, tonight we're
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.120]   having Indian food.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.560]   And I feel like when I go to a restaurant, I'm in a similar mindset where sometimes if
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.080]   it's like a single use menu, I ask for a pen and I start crossing things off until I
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.280]   try to land on something.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.680]   And rationally, I'm like, you know what, if I just looked at what I thought were the
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.800]   top three things and just picked one, I would probably enjoy this dinner experience
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.360]   better because I didn't spend my whole time stressing out about what to pick.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:48.200]   But I have this burning desire that I think, you know, unfortunately is coupled very
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.600]   heavily with my optimization personality and probably why I started this podcast.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.880]   But to get the most optimal outcome, to save the most money, to have the best
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.680]   experience.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.880]   And there are probably circumstances where that matters and some that aren't and
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.280]   circumstances where it doesn't matter at all.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.560]   How can you help me?
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.280]   Okay, this is really good.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:12.720]   And by the way, I love that we're having this conversation because optimization is a
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.360]   good thing, but it can be incredibly crippling.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:20.160]   And I am also an optimizer.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.680]   I also have a crazy amount of FOBO, like that's the reason I came up with the word
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.160]   because I was like, that is me.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:33.840]   And I have seen, though, when FOBO gets out of control and it gets really messed up, it
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.920]   can ruin people's lives.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.440]   And I'm happy to tell you some stories about what I've seen.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:43.080]   But here's the thing, and I did a TED video about this, a TED talk video about my
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.120]   decision-making methodology that I've been using now for my entire adult life.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:53.080]   When I make decisions, I classify them into three areas, three buckets, high
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.160]   stakes, low stakes, and no stakes.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:01.040]   High stakes decisions are ones that need real due diligence and real work and a
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:01.920]   structured process.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.720]   You know, it's like, where should I go to college?
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.960]   Should I change a job?
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.520]   Things like that.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:11.480]   You know, low stakes decisions are things that require some judgment, but I won't
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.960]   remember really having decided about these things in about a month's time.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.200]   So it's things like, which printer should I buy?
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:18.600]   Right?
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.960]   Which hotel should I stay at?
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.560]   Stuff like that.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.960]   So, you know, it's like, there is some money involved, there's an investment, you
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.480]   want to work well, but, you know, you don't need to like spend your whole life
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.520]   making a decision.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.000]   And then there's what's called no stakes decisions.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.480]   Those are things that you literally won't remember having decided in three days.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.800]   Like, could you tell me what you had for dinner three nights ago in your
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.760]   decision-making process?
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:40.840]   Could you do it?
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:41.800]   Probably not.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.400]   There you go.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:42.920]   Okay.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:48.520]   So when you have a no stakes decision and I used to be that guy, I'd go to a
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.080]   restaurant.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.600]   I mean, you know how New Yorkers are too.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.800]   Everybody's like, well, they try to customize their order in every way.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.640]   Like, can I have a salad, but like hold the kale and also can you add back the
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.160]   kale and all that sort of stuff.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.880]   When I have a no stakes decision, I simply outsource.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:06.720]   I, when I go to a restaurant, I will say, you know, I don't eat this and this, but
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.440]   I eat everything else.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.840]   You decide what we're going to have.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.520]   You know, if I had a strong feeling about it, I would express that opinion.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:17.320]   But if I'm in the Fobo space, then I take myself and the drama out of it.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.000]   So that's how I deal with that.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.600]   When it's a low stakes decision, which is something that has some relative
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.080]   importance, I outsource it to people.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.160]   So I will say, you know, say I'm buying that printer.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.880]   Like I have a friend who knows all about that stuff.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.880]   I'll say to him, I want to buy a printer.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.520]   I need basic functionality.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.840]   I want it to be less than $300.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.320]   What do you think?
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.320]   And this is the guy who sent you three links to Amazon, you know, and then
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.600]   basically decides for you because when you go on Amazon, there's like 973
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.800]   printers and they all look the same.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.120]   So I just find a person who has some expertise and I outsource to them.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.880]   It's kind of like having a travel agent.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.320]   If you're doing travel, stuff like that.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.800]   And then for the high stakes, I do it myself, but I, you know, I engage with
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.280]   other people and I have a whole structure process that I read about in the book.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.760]   But that outsourcing piece and people notice it.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.120]   It's funny.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.280]   People are like, Patrick, you always go with the flow.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.800]   You don't make decisions about these things.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.840]   And I'm like, yeah, it's not that I'm not decisive.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.960]   It's that I am freeing up my time and space and energy for things
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.240]   that matter, and these just don't.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.480]   And if they did matter and I did have an opinion, I would know it and I
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.640]   would express that opinion, but I just don't care.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:25.760]   Are there any other tactics if you're in that middle ground?
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.840]   I think the low stakes decisions seem like the toughest ones for me.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:34.280]   You know, I'm thinking the hotel is a great example and I have the exact
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:39.280]   problem you're talking about where it's there are so many hotels and they're
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.560]   probably all fine above a certain category.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:46.440]   And I could outsource that, but I still have this feeling of, gosh, the person
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.320]   I outsource this to, what if they didn't think about this?
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.400]   What if they didn't think about that?
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.640]   And it's still tough.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:56.640]   Is there like what's level two remedy for people who find it very difficult
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.320]   to even outsource those decisions?
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:04.800]   Yeah, well, part of it is you need to sort of do the work of accepting the
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.440]   fact that you're being incredibly obstructionist to your own happiness.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.800]   You really are.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.640]   Because again, this is all perception.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.560]   You go on a website, there's three hotels, you start worrying
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.560]   about all of these things.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:22.040]   You have no idea whether even these things, like, even if you ask every
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.920]   question in the book, you would never really know until you got there.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:25.320]   Right.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:30.520]   So like you are creating a mental model that is flawed because you somehow
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:35.080]   assume that by doing additional research, you are somehow going to make a better
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:35.520]   decision.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.120]   And what is interesting about that, and the research shows this, this is a
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.440]   really fascinating point from Barry Schwartz's book, is that people who,
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.760]   there's what's this terms that are called maximizer and satisficer.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.840]   Maximizers are people who do all the research and they, you know, spend a
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.240]   crazy amount of time and energy to make the perfect decision.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.920]   Satisficers are people like me who say, you know, it's good enough.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.400]   Like once we get to good enough, I'm going to move on with my life because
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.720]   I got, I got stuff to do.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:07.160]   In the end, maximizers actually make better decisions.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:11.560]   They are able to, through their additional work, make a better decision.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:17.160]   However, they are less happy with their decision because they spend so much
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.960]   time researching every aspect that they spend a lot of their time focusing on
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.320]   the other road they didn't take.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   And so a big part of why you're feeling FOBO is because you are feeling
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.480]   anticipated regret at what you didn't choose.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:34.320]   And so, you know, I think that's where you start in terms of the work.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.120]   And it's not like a hack per se, because it's more about being in the mindset
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:44.200]   to recognize, like, I am engaging in a type of behavior that is at the end of
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.760]   the day, extremely unproductive.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:54.160]   And once you do that and you start to think like, will I even remember this?
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.720]   Then, you know, then you will be free.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.960]   And the reality of decisions and the thing that people don't think about
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.040]   is decisions are like doors.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.600]   If you never walked through the first door, you can't see what's inside the
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.480]   room and then go through the next door and so on and so forth in your life.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:13.360]   With decisions, if you can't make a basic decision, you don't open the door to the
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.000]   next set of things you're going to have to deal with.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.560]   And so that's really important.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:21.200]   But I think, you know, in terms of like a specific thing with hotels, again, I
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.280]   think it's about trying to think of the people that you know or the sources that
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.160]   you know that are going to offer you the best advice and then going with them and
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.520]   recognizing that you are taking the thing about decision.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.680]   Every decision is a risk.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.720]   You are taking risks, but there is no perfect decision.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.600]   It doesn't exist.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.160]   And I think realizing that going in is really helpful.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:47.880]   You mentioned earlier one of the abundance of choice is in the job world.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.400]   There's so many jobs and that is a high stakes decision.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.880]   I think right now there are a lot of jobs.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.840]   There's a lot of, you know, I've driven by, you know, at every level of the
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.560]   spectrum, there are people dying to get workers.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:06.240]   And there's a thing going on right now, at least that I've read a little bit about
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.640]   the great resignation that all these people who have been locked up in the one
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.560]   job for the last year or two because it's been COVID and they haven't really made a
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.040]   lot of change, they're all going to go find something better.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:24.120]   Is that something you think is driven by this kind of FOBO and FOMO all kind of
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:24.960]   meshed into one?
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.800]   Do you think this is a real thing?
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   I've read that up to 40 percent of people are going to change jobs this next year.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.440]   I'm curious to get your thoughts.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.400]   I have been thinking a lot about the great resignation as well.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:42.080]   In fact, I did a whole podcast episode on it because it is a fascinating trend.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.920]   I think in the month of April alone, 4 million people quit their jobs.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.160]   And I just see it in my, I'm sure you have friends too, like I have all these
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.400]   friends who are unemployed right now and they're like living their best life.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.120]   And, you know, why do all unemployed people go to Joshua Tree?
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.200]   That's a mystery to me, but I've noticed it.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.560]   And so maybe somebody can write us the answer.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:05.280]   But, but it is, I think what's happening there is a couple of things.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.040]   If I put on my sort of like demographics sociologist hat, number one is I think a
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.800]   lot, and there's a really good episode of this American life that actually looked
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.960]   at the great resignation.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.920]   So I'm, I'm sort of taking a page out of their notes.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:27.280]   People recognized during the last year and a half, if their company really, truly
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.240]   cared about them.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.520]   And it just kind of reminds me in 2008, I was in the middle of the financial
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.920]   crisis and it was awful.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.880]   I was at AIG and my whole career blew up.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:41.320]   And what happened to me in that moment was I realized that my company didn't care
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.080]   about me at all.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:46.000]   And it was incapable of caring for me for so many reasons.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   And I lost faith in the company and kind of in the corporate world in general.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.840]   Like I was, I was like as good, I was like a, you know, like the way that
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.720]   somebody is like a good Catholic, I was like a good corporatist and I believed
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.960]   in the whole institution.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.280]   And then I didn't anymore.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.920]   And I thought it was deeply flawed and bad for me.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.240]   And I think people feel that way about employers, the ones that didn't show,
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.120]   you know, much caring for them.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.840]   I think people also recognize the fragility of life, much as I did after
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:16.040]   nine 11, when I went to business school and, you know, felt all the FOMO people,
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:20.840]   you know, we have been through such a deeply scarring experience as a society
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.920]   that people are just like, life's too short to put up with this malarkey.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:31.680]   As like Joe Biden would say now, all of that aside, here's the problem.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.200]   And this is where it gets nasty.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:39.640]   Um, Chris, have you ever been unemployed for like a long period of time?
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.480]   Yes.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.880]   I actually also 2008 got laid off, tried to find a bunch of different
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.600]   side hustles and part-time jobs.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:52.240]   I wouldn't say I, I was like necessarily looking for a job, but I was not
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.240]   working for, for about a year.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.400]   So it's similar.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:55.640]   Okay.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.880]   So you'll, I think you'll appreciate this.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.760]   I quit my job on wall street.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.960]   I had saved like every dime I ever made.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.080]   My parents were great in teaching me to save.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.000]   So I had like years of runway.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.280]   And so I felt like, I was like, well, this is going to be chill.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.640]   I'm going to quit my job.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.600]   I'm going to be chill.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.120]   It's gonna be great.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:20.560]   As I started spending my money that I had saved and watched my bank account go down.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.160]   It's stressful.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.200]   I felt bad.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.520]   It's like, I don't want to, it's like, Oh, I don't want to have a muffin.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.800]   That's a 350.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.120]   Right.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:33.480]   And so I realized that like, even if you saved living out of your savings is like,
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.080]   it's very scary and awful and you don't enjoy anything.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.520]   And I was told that by a friend and I was like, that won't be me.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.120]   And it was me.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.320]   And so I found it really difficult.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:48.480]   And so that was from the very privileged position of having savings.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.600]   Like if you don't, then you're not, it's even worse.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:51.760]   Right.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.240]   And so what I fear for people, it's like when you quit your job, I remember I felt
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.960]   joy, like a deep and abiding joy every day.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.080]   I'd wake up and I'd like, like, it was like out of like a animated movie, like a
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.160]   bird would land on my shoulder and I'd like sing to it.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:04.880]   I was so happy.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.320]   You know, like it was just, I was like, I feel so free.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.160]   And that feelings, they last for a while, actually.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.520]   They're shockingly powerful, but then eventually over time they fade because,
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.760]   you know, you get used to it like anything else.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.560]   And then the fear and the insecurity and the, Oh my God, what I'm going to do?
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.000]   Am I going to find out, all that sort of stuff comes in.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.800]   And that is what I fear for people who quit.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   And so what I encourage people to do rather than up and quit your job is find
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.960]   a way to, you know, if you want to try something new, if you're like, I always
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.120]   want to be a chef and right now I'm a programmer and instead of just quitting
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.320]   your job and going to cooking school, do some diligence into whether you even like
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.960]   you, this is FOMO, like perception or deception.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.280]   Maybe you like cooking at home.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.720]   Do you want to cook every day?
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.880]   946 people come to your restaurant.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:55.280]   Like a lot of the things that feel so attractive to us, if we actually dug into
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.840]   them, we would not enjoy professionally.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.280]   And I remember reading this article in the New York times about this woman who was a
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:05.240]   lawyer, a corporate lawyer, and all she wanted to do was bake and she quit her job
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:05.960]   and opened a bakery.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.920]   And you know what she realized?
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.760]   She hated it.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.680]   And she would dream about being a lawyer again while she was baking her cookies.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.280]   So you just want to know that.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.200]   I think it's really, and if you are going to quit, have a very structured plan about
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.440]   how you're going to live and what you're going to spend money on and how you're
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.840]   going to sort of manage the finances.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.280]   Because if you go in with a solid plan, I think you're much better positioned.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.040]   Yeah, that makes total sense.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:34.080]   And I've actually read that a massive number of kids nowadays say that they want
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:39.400]   to be entrepreneurs and you wrote a book about this 10% entrepreneur concept, which
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:44.640]   I think is fascinating because most people don't realize what it really takes until
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.560]   you experience it. And I know I kind of saw entrepreneurship with rose colored
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.760]   glasses before going full force into running a company and managing a team and
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.920]   trying to find customers and trying to make it work and ultimately realizing it
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:01.880]   didn't. Do you think that is a framework for people who have something they want to
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:07.360]   pursue, but feel they need to pursue it full time because that's just the norm?
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:12.320]   Is there a way to kind of overcome that feeling of, "Oh, I have to quit my job to
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:17.880]   go bake," but is there a way to just kind of adopt this 10% lifestyle easily or
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.280]   what's a process for doing that?
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:25.560]   So we're all sold this bill of goods that, you know, unless you're suffering and in
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.560]   pain as an entrepreneur, you can't succeed.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.760]   And you see it all the time.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:37.600]   Like there's a whole like entrepreneurship porn kind of industry, like grinding
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:44.080]   really hard. And people are realizing that's kind of all BS, but it is still like a
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:48.160]   cultural thing that unless you're bleeding, like somehow you didn't play hard
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.400]   enough. And that's just not me.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:57.160]   And so when I left Wall Street, I was like, "Oh man, I should be an entrepreneur
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.240]   because it's the way to go." And I have a lot of friends who are entrepreneurs, but
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:06.000]   I didn't have the guts to just jump into one thing, especially after the AIG
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.560]   debacle, I was like, "I will never, I want to be diversified.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:15.040]   I want to have a much more portfolio approach." And, you know, as I started to do
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.280]   all these things on the side, I realized, actually, this is pretty amazing because
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:22.680]   you can have sort of like a steady income stream from stuff, but then you can kind
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.120]   of up, you know, sort of put 10% of your time, money and energy into very high risk
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.120]   things that, you know, potentially have high reward.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.160]   And it's also a great way to try an idea.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.120]   And then if you like that, you could then scale up, you know, you don't have to stay
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.480]   at 10%, you can go 50, a hundred.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.280]   In fact, many of the people that I interviewed for my book started at 10%,
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.200]   figured out the idea of work, like, you know, they did their minimum viable
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.480]   product, they got some paying customers, and then they went to their company and
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.800]   said, "Hey, I have this startup, can I work one day a week on it, or can I work
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.720]   three days a week on it?" And, you know, companies need good people, so they were
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.440]   pretty amenable.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.600]   And then over the course of a period of time, then they ended up going full time.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.560]   So I think it's a really sensible thing to do.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.840]   It also, the statistics show us there was a study out of University of Wisconsin
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.840]   that people who start something on the side and then go full time are 50% more
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:14.120]   likely to succeed than people who just jump in because they give themselves the
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.240]   runway to fail and make mistakes before they have to live off the business.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.440]   So it makes a lot of sense.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.240]   I mean, it doesn't work for every business model.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.240]   If it's super capital intensive, like that's not going to make a lot of sense
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.880]   for you because you need to raise money and investors aren't going to back you if
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.680]   you're a part timer.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.800]   But I think it's, it's really sensible.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.440]   And the reality is that many businesses that we all know were started as 10%.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.080]   You know, Apple was started as a 10%.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:39.520]   Jobs in Wisconsin were working at HP and they started it in their cubicle.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.240]   You know, the garage store is a lie.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.360]   It's like, it was made up.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.120]   And I think it's for, I've done it now for a really long time.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:51.040]   I know many people who do it and I think it's an incredible way to, to make your
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.200]   career way more interesting.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:59.400]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and trade coffee is a
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.680]   great addition to your new year routine.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.280]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.360]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:12.840]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:17.080]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters, so you can enjoy their
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:21.640]   craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out for
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.160]   coffee.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.840]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with trade, sign up for a subscription
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.160]   or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.600]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:33.760]   it.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:38.280]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from trade, but this
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   last bag of beans from drink coffee, do stuff in Tahoe, it's called bark the moon
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.760]   and it's so delicious.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.280]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a trade subscription.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:52.320]   Right now, trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans.

[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.960]   free bag with select subscription plans, all the hacks.com/trade.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:10.840]   Do you all remember episode 122, when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.000]   up your cooking at home?
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.480]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.880]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:22.720]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.760]   cookware from any day, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.680]   them for this episode.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.000]   Any day is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.440]   scratch in the microwave.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:38.000]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.240]   and simplifies the process so much.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:45.000]   The cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.400]   reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:50.760]   too.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:55.000]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your any day adventure, I highly
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   recommend David Chang's salmon rice.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.480]   It is so good.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:03.240]   And if you haven't checked out the matte black IO collection they launched last
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.040]   year, you have to check it out.

[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:36.960]   Okay.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.240]   So you've got hacks for FOMO.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.880]   You've got hacks for manifesting entrepreneurship without having to quit
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.640]   your job.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.960]   I know you'd emailed me and said, you've got lots of hacks.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:50.640]   What else is in your arsenal of things people can use to improve life, improve
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.960]   work, or anything around that area?
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:53.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.080]   So I have a funny hack.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.120]   Well, I think it's funny.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.400]   You might not, but I'm going to say it anyway, because it makes life just a
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.000]   little more interesting and fun.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.360]   And I think it has some benefits.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:07.920]   Whenever I go to a restaurant and I put my name down, I say, my name is Pierre.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.600]   Now, can you guess why I do that?
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.600]   I don't know, because French people are great at food.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   I just, I always think that like, if the, if my name is Pierre, they'll assume that I
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.040]   have higher standards than the average person and treat me better.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.560]   And do you think it works?
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.080]   I do.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.800]   I feel like I get tables much more quickly.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.320]   The only downside of it is that nobody knows how to spell Pierre.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.520]   They spell it P-I-E-R, Pierre.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.400]   So that's kind of weird.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.640]   But you know, it's not that offensive if your fake name is misspelled.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.440]   It's a, that, that's, that's one.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:43.480]   Another one that I really love, this has actually been a transformative
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.800]   hack for me, is do you meditate?
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:51.240]   I, it's one of those things that I've seen value from and I've gone off and on, but
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.400]   I've never been able to make it a habit that kind of lasts.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.200]   Why do you think?
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:01.040]   I think, I mean, I, I had Laura Vanderkam, who's written a lot about productivity,
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.360]   came on the podcast and kind of challenged the idea that you don't have time for
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:04.720]   something.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.280]   It's like, no, you haven't prioritized it.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:11.640]   So I can't say I don't have time for it, but I'd say I haven't continually
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.560]   prioritized it.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:18.240]   And it's one of those things that I think it's hard to see the tangible immediate
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.760]   benefit, but it's easier to see the long-term benefit.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:25.320]   So on any given day, it's like, well, if I don't do it today, like, you know, it's
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.120]   probably going to be fine.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.840]   And then that just kind of snowballs into not doing it for weeks at a time.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.040]   And, and then it kind of just stops being a routine.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:32.680]   Totally.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.760]   That's exactly right.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.240]   That's exactly how I was.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:43.000]   My brother has been meditating for like a really long time and I saw the effect on
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:43.200]   him.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:48.240]   I was amazed at his resilience, his ability to deal with when bad things happen.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:55.200]   Like he just was like, so, I don't know, like grounded and I wanted that and I
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:55.840]   couldn't get it.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.360]   I tried, I even went to like this thing with him and I didn't like the style or
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:00.800]   the people.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:05.960]   So it wasn't for me, but I would start going to classes and I realized like many
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.720]   other things in the world.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.120]   Like there's no one way to do things.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.800]   Like if somebody tells you you're meditating wrong, like they, they've missed
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.280]   the, there's not, it's not like that.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:17.280]   There's many different ways to achieve that objective and many different styles
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:17.800]   of meditation.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:22.280]   So I thought that was like a good thing to know, but still I couldn't do it.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.480]   Like I would, you know, do it once a week or something.
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.320]   And then I recognized that I really needed it.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:32.200]   And about three years ago I was at brunch with a friend of mine, this guy, Ajay
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.440]   Kishore, who was an entrepreneur and he and I were kind of new friends at the
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.680]   time and it was right at the end of the year.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.720]   And he was like, what do you, do you have any New Year's resolutions?
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:44.360]   And I was like, no, I don't actually believe in New Year's resolutions.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.480]   I think they're, they're not for me.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.840]   And in fact, anytime I start something new in the beginning of the year, I
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:53.960]   started on the 2nd of January so that I've already broken my resolution, the
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.880]   little like, the little thing I do.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:49:00.400]   I've done that since like I was a child, but I said, I really want to meditate.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.040]   And he said, me too.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:07.320]   And so what we did is we created an accountability pact.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:13.400]   And every day for the last three years, I go on this app called Habit Share.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.080]   It's like not, it's just, it's, I love the app.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.680]   I have not, I should reach out to them actually.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.160]   Cause like, it's not a fancy app.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:24.640]   Like it is, it is so no frills, but you just go and you create a habit pact with
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.320]   somebody and you both sign up.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.920]   And then every day when you check in that you've done the thing, it sends a
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.120]   notification to the other person.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.480]   So I started that and I started at five minutes a day.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.120]   So I didn't try to go hardcore.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.360]   Five minutes a day.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:42.400]   And then it was 5.10, 5.20, 5.30, so on up to 10 minutes, which is what I do today.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.000]   And I have done that now.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.120]   I have missed three days and the entire year so far.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.080]   I didn't miss a day last year.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.240]   I'm also very competitive.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:57.480]   So I call it competitive meditation because it's sort of like, I mean, it's
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:01.200]   ridiculous, but it's true because I don't want to, I want to have my stats be
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:06.200]   perfect, but the, even though that's kind of whack and not in line with the spirit
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.680]   of why you meditate, I will say I do it every day and I think it's much more
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.600]   important to be every day than to worry about how long you did it for.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.200]   I had this friend who started meditating and he was like, well, you don't, you
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.160]   know, you don't do it long enough.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.400]   You have to do this much time.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.240]   And I was like, okay.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.840]   And then of course he doesn't meditate ever.
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.720]   He's completely fallen off the wagon because it wasn't sustainable.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.520]   And I also plan it into my day.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:28.320]   I have it on my calendar.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.560]   I look in for a spot on my day and I know going into the day when I'm going to do
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:31.680]   it.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:35.800]   So I encourage you, you, by the way, you can join my accountability group if you
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:41.080]   want, Chris, if you want to take it on, because it will, especially you, I can
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.720]   tell you would, you're not going to like be cool having crappy stats.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:47.600]   And so you will make time for it.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.800]   And it is amazing because at the end of the day, what it has done for me, and I'm
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.960]   not like some new agey guy, that's just not me.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:57.920]   I'm just like a practical person, but it is really sapped me of my ability to
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.080]   freak out and get angry about anything.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.440]   I just can't like, I have much more low key calm.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.840]   I'm still outgoing and fun, but I just can't get mad at somebody.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:08.960]   Like I don't freak out.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.320]   So that's good.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:11.880]   That's amazing.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:12.480]   It's funny.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.760]   I was, I can actually see my Peloton in this room.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:21.560]   And I was thinking about how the Peloton, the reason that I used it for so long.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.320]   And now of course, I'm going to have to take a break here, was to be competitive
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:25.880]   with people.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:30.840]   And I loved the feeling of texting someone after and being like, I just
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.080]   beat your record on that ride.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:34.960]   And then I was like, oh man, Peloton actually does meditation.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.760]   Why haven't they come up with their version of competitive meditation?
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:42.040]   But I feel like maybe it takes away the spirit, but if I need to use Habit
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:46.120]   Share, a competitive meditation sounds like a great way to get back into it.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:46.800]   It is.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.600]   You're very welcome.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.840]   Anybody listening is welcome.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.280]   If you reach out to me at Let's Connect with Patrick McGinnis, you can join my
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:55.560]   group, but if you join me and then you don't do it and you're always like
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:52:01.000]   missing it, I will kick you out because I'm not here to see bad stats.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.160]   I want excellence.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.720]   That's awesome.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.200]   Any other final hacks?
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.680]   Oh man, well, this is not so much of a hack, but it's something that I did
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.560]   that really was a life changing as well for me that I would encourage everybody
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:16.920]   to do, which is get yourself a proper setup for your home office.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.960]   Like I have been working for myself for a decade.
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.440]   I worked off of a laptop for like nine years.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:26.120]   And then when I moved into this new place that I moved into this year, I got
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.640]   myself an extra large screen.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.960]   I got the trackpad, the wireless one.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.280]   I got the wireless keyboard.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.040]   I got a really good webcam, much better than the one that's on my laptop.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.840]   I got, you know, a nice light, a ring light, cause you know, it's 2021.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.200]   So you want to look good.
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.760]   And I invested in all of that.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:45.920]   And what it has done for me is radically improved my productivity.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:51.400]   And also I enjoy sitting at that desk, you know, working off a laptop.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.480]   And now when I do it, by the way, like I hate it.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.440]   If I'm like at a coffee shop on my laptop, I'm like, how did
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.640]   I do this for so many years?
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:02.440]   And so it's just better for your health, but it also just makes your work better.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.200]   And so I encourage people to make that investment.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.320]   And by the way, I was actually, this was kind of crazy.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.880]   It was so much cheaper than I could have ever thought to
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.200]   get all of this stuff together.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.320]   You know, stuff is just really cheap now.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.240]   And so it, you know, you're not going to break the bank to do it.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:22.160]   I have a setup and now I can't really work on a laptop, which actually is good.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:25.880]   While I might not leave my phone out of the bedroom, I often never use my
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:29.120]   computer in the bedroom because I'm like, no, no, no, I want to work at my desk.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:31.600]   I don't want to work on a laptop in the bed or on a couch.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.200]   So I totally agree.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.560]   I just think like, I'm like, I really want to look at Twitter.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.960]   I'm going to sit at my desk.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.720]   That's what I run over there.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:41.680]   It's so sad.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:46.360]   But I will say there are a lot of companies and, you know, they
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.720]   may or may not publish this.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:48.800]   You may want to reach out.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:53.560]   But I've heard of a lot of friends whose companies were willing to help pay for
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.560]   something to make their office setup good.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:00.240]   So even if there's not a formal policy, I would reach out to your manager, your HR
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:04.520]   team and say, Hey, is there any room in the budget for me to upgrade my desk?
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.600]   Upgrade my chair, get a monitor, get a light.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:11.080]   And I would, I would be surprised if most people couldn't get someone to pay for
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.560]   something to make their experience better, especially because a more productive
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.040]   employee is a better employee for the company as well.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.040]   That's a smart idea.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.120]   All right.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.520]   This is awesome.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:23.000]   Where, gosh, you have so many things going on.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.160]   Where should people find everything you're working on right now?
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:26.760]   All right.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:31.040]   So first of all, everybody, this is a momentous week in the history of
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:36.400]   podcasting because me and Chris are going on each other's shows to Chris kindly had
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:41.200]   me on his show and he is coming over to FOMO Sapiens, which is my show at
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.160]   FOMOSapiens.com.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.800]   And so you can find that wherever you get podcasts and smash that subscribe
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.280]   button for all the goodies.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.680]   That's number one.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:54.200]   Number two, if you want to learn more about my work, you can also check out
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.640]   PatrickMcGinnis.com and I'm, you know, the links to all the socials.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.840]   I have a really, um, I think it's pretty cool.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.960]   Instagram at Patrick J.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:02.480]   McGinnis.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:05.920]   And as you, you've probably just heard a million times, I love Twitter.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:06.960]   So I'm at PJ McGinnis.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.960]   So all of those places.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:11.400]   And, and you'll also be able to, if you're interested in 10% Entrepreneur, I've
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.760]   released an, um, an audio course, like in a podcast format with a company called
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.200]   Himalaya.

[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.840]   I will link to everything here that we talked about and some of the books you
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.120]   mentioned all in the show notes.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.040]   Thank you so much for coming on.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:34.800]   And, uh, I'm excited to swap sides and be on the other side of the table.

[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.560]   And yes, we will continue the conversation over a phone with Safekids.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:44.120]   That was fantastic.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.560]   I hope you all enjoyed this conversation as much as I did, and I'll make sure to
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:50.120]   put links to everything we discussed in the show notes.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:54.600]   I'm about to kick off the process of finding the guests, scheduling, and
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.680]   recording the next few months of episodes.
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:00.480]   So if there's a topic or person you have in mind, please send me a note and I'll
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.320]   do my best to try to make it happen.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.160]   My email is chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.800]   You're also welcome to send any questions you have for me or any
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.200]   feedback you have on this show.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:14.480]   I love getting all your emails and I'll do my best to respond to every single one.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.320]   All right.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.400]   Thank you so much for all your support.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.480]   See you next week.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:36.840]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.600]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:44.800]   It's called the personal finance podcast, and it's much more about building
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:48.680]   generational wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.760]   about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:54.880]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.280]   this world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.080]   make this show so entertaining.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:04.000]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.200]   But recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.760]   stats that will blow your mind.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.880]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:17.720]   participating in their employer's retirement plan, and that's just one of
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.000]   the many fascinating stats he shared.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.920]   The personal finance podcast has something for everyone.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:26.560]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.160]   with your money and grow your wealth.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.320]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:34.720]   Just search for the personal finance podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.160]   wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
