[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.360]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.960]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.760]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.560]   and I'm a diehard optimizer who loves doing all the research
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.720]   to help you get the best experience in life
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.320]   without necessarily an expensive price tag.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.420]   Though, here's a thought experiment.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.600]   Imagine that one day you die
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.520]   and you have all this money in your account,
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.600]   but actually you don't.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.620]   How does that feel?
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.680]   You die with zero?
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.500]   Scary, like you did something wrong?
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.160]   That's exactly what today's guest recommends.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.500]   He's Bill Perkins, a long-time hedge fund manager
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.400]   and energy trader who's written a book called "Die With Zero,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.320]   Getting All You Can From Your Money and Your Life."
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.720]   I loved the book.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.860]   You might have a lot of objections to his concept,
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.940]   and I actually did before I read it,
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.900]   but now I'm a huge convert,
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.320]   so we're gonna dive into all of it.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.880]   We're gonna talk about what it actually means
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.040]   to die with zero,
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.200]   why you might wanna stop maximizing net worth
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.960]   and focus on net fulfillment,
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.840]   why you should bank memory dividends,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.780]   and the ways to do that for maximum ROI,
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.480]   why Bill thinks, contrary to financial advice,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.980]   you should save less money when you're young,
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.200]   why you should think about your life
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.140]   as distinct seasons or time buckets,
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.140]   and how that can help you make the best choices
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.420]   about spending your money and a lot more.
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.600]   So let's get started right after this.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.500]   Just a quick heads up
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.040]   that there's some language in this episode
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.720]   that you might not want your kids to hear,
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.420]   so maybe throw your headphones in for this one.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.220]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.540]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.040]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.640]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.080]   in your situation,
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.680]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.960]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.800]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.960]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.040]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.480]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.880]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.140]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.260]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.620]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.340]   Now, the majority of Longangle members
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.140]   are first generation wealth,
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.220]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.380]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.700]   and learn from each other
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.300]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.580]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.920]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.340]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.500]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.460]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.940]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.380]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.740]   to your children's education,
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.040]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.500]   So many of these conversations
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.720]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.380]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.260]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.420]   I encourage you to check out Longangle,
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.500]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.620]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.140]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.080]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.160]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.180]   Bill, welcome to the show, and thank you for being here.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.020]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.860]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.340]   Wow, we got a lot to go over, don't we?
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.180]   - I didn't even mention some of the,
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.100]   oh, we got two daughters.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.540]   There's a lot we could talk about.
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.380]   - Right.
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.980]   - But your book's all about dying with zero,
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.260]   and that many people save too much money
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.660]   and leave it behind instead of spending it
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.580]   in ways that are more meaningful.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.900]   You've obviously been very skilled
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.300]   and fortunate at building wealth.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.400]   So before we jump into all these lessons,
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.980]   I just wanna make sure I understand who this is for,
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.540]   and does it actually apply to people
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.420]   with just a modest income or who haven't built wealth yet?
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.420]   - So the book is a bunch of mental models,
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.900]   and it's a counterfactual regret minimization algorithm
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.940]   that's solving for net fulfillment.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.980]   A lot of people have algorithms for building wealth.
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.260]   It's solving for building wealth.
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260]   I'm solving for net fulfillment.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.460]   So what variables are the inputs?
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.560]   Your wealth, your health, and your time.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.700]   Even though people may have more wealth
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.860]   or better health or more time,
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.960]   those variables still you can use
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.200]   formulaically with these mental models
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.080]   to maximize your net fulfillment.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.200]   I wouldn't say this book isn't for unhealthy fat people.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.700]   They can still get value out of this
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.080]   to maximize their own net fulfillment.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.880]   And the same thing for people with not that much money.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.320]   Like obviously a person who's over-saving by millions
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.200]   is formulaically getting more value
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.040]   in terms of the amount of waste that they're wasting
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.140]   by dying with a bunch of money in the bank.
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.680]   But everybody still gets value relative to them
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.860]   to get more out of this one ride called life.
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.100]   - And how do you define net fulfillment?
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.920]   - So I basically say that the sum of your experiences,
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.620]   your choices, every moment in your life,
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.780]   when you make a decision, those choices,
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.140]   that is what constitutes your life.
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.820]   And the sum of all those decisions and experiences
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.340]   that you consume will determine
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.020]   whether you've had a full life or fulfilling life
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.900]   or not so fulfilling life,
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.980]   relative to the best life you can possibly have.
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.340]   And so I define net fulfillment as your choices,
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.540]   i.e. your experiences.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.580]   And when I use experiences,
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.780]   I mean it in the broadest sense of the word.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.980]   I don't necessarily mean always taking a trip.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.620]   It could be walking with grandmother.
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.260]   It could be donating to a charity.
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.620]   It's just every single choice that you make.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.480]   - And before we jump in,
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.960]   I actually wanna talk about a few common misconceptions
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.140]   because I feel like some of them came up
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.420]   a little bit late in the book.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.300]   Some of them came up early.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.580]   So I feel like this is important.
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.260]   So one I'll share, and I'll ask if there are others,
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.340]   is around retirement.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.460]   And it's that the amount you actually need in retirement
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.020]   is often lower than people think.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.020]   And it's no surprise that also,
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.860]   people increase their assets in retirement.
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.940]   Not all of them, but a good number of them.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.340]   And so something that was helpful for me to realize
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.980]   is if we're all thinking, oh, I should save all this money
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.700]   because I'm gonna need it, because I'm gonna be spending.
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.540]   Well, it turns out you probably will spend less
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.020]   based on actual studies, not just your opinion.
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.980]   And you might actually make more in retirement.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.940]   Are there other things that might be common misconceptions
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.620]   people have that understanding
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.300]   might make this whole conversation easier to process
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.140]   in those minds?
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.220]   - Yeah, adjacent to what you're saying about spending,
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.940]   the data is kind of overwhelming that people spend less,
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.740]   even adjusting for healthcare costs, right?
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.020]   Like people are like, what about healthcare
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.300]   and rising healthcare?
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.160]   It's their bodies, the deterioration,
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.140]   the change in their attitudes, et cetera,
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.220]   their ability to do or enjoy certain activities.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.380]   Probably all of us have a relative
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.860]   that doesn't like to fly.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.220]   You could take them somewhere, but they're like,
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.140]   I don't wanna sit on a plane for three hours
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.660]   because it hurts my back or my knees
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.980]   or something to that effect.
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.180]   There's probably people my age or younger,
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.900]   40s used to be athletic and like could not go play
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.700]   a pickup game of flag football right now.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.700]   It wouldn't be as enjoyable.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.620]   They could play it.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.020]   The misconception that's out there
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.060]   is people think their lives are gonna be
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.100]   like a carnival commercial when they retire.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.160]   And it cannot be further from the truth.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.420]   And having lived in the Virgin Islands
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.540]   where these cruise lines all park up,
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.820]   like we'd have three, four to seven ships
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.260]   during high season coming in.
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.420]   And the main activity is going into the shops, right?
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.100]   Not these athletic activities to buy something,
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.140]   not for themselves, but for their granddaughters
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.520]   or a relative, et cetera.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.660]   Like they're actually looking for ways
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.200]   to consume the money that they have
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.340]   because they cannot consume it into the experiences
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.860]   that they thought they would.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.940]   - You talk about the declining utility of money with age.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.060]   You have all this money and you say,
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.380]   oh, I'm gonna punt on this awesome, amazing trip
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.460]   till I'm retired and I can take time off work.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.820]   And then you're like, I don't know,
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.260]   do I really want to go walk around Japan nonstop?
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.060]   I say this because I took my family,
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.180]   my sister, her husband, my parents to Japan.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.020]   And the degree to which we wanted the kids to go explore
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.940]   was just not the degree to which my parents
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.380]   were willing to go.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.900]   And I don't know if they would have thought
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.860]   that was the case 20 years ago,
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.820]   but there were things they had to miss out on
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.700]   because they're just older and they couldn't keep up.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.460]   - Yeah, I think a lot of people have the model
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.740]   in their head that their ability to convert money
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.700]   into experiences like your body is static,
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.780]   it will remain the same.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.020]   They kind of divorce this idea that,
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.740]   wow, my mental acuity is gonna decline,
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.020]   my lung capacity is gonna decline,
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.900]   my bone density is gonna decline,
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.420]   my muscle mass is gonna decline about 1% a year
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.420]   after age like 35.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.460]   So they don't put all these facts together
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.300]   in that, hey, this is obviating either my desire
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.100]   or ability to actually enjoy these activities.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.820]   And so you have a prime example of walking around Japan
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.940]   and Tokyo and so they delayed that trip
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.500]   or that gratification, let's just assume they did,
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.140]   to a point where there really wasn't any gratification.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.700]   Tokyo was less valuable a trip to them.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.340]   - I think there were things where we came home
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.300]   and we were like, oh, you missed this thing.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.220]   They were like, we're okay because if we had pushed
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.300]   ourselves, it would have been a mess,
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.660]   but we had a great trip.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.900]   Like, I think they had a great trip,
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.900]   but I think that five, 10 years ago,
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.660]   they would have gotten to do 20% more
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.900]   and it would have been a better trip.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.740]   - Correct.
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.580]   - So that's what you have.
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.420]   There's no sense in crying over spilt milk
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.060]   or what they did or didn't do,
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.340]   but you can easily look at the scenario and say,
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.860]   that was not the optimal time for them to take that trip
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.020]   in the totality of the arc of their lives.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.740]   We don't get to play a sim game and Monte Carlo our lives,
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.700]   be like, well, let me do this trip here and that, whatever.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.820]   But what I try to do with this book is get people
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.700]   to think about how do I optimize for net fulfillment?
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.020]   Where do experiences belong?
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.980]   First, what experiences do I want, right, in my life?
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.420]   And then very importantly,
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.460]   where do those experiences belong?
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.380]   Where does the trip to Japan belong?
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.980]   Where does going to the opera belong?
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.460]   Where does hiking this mountain belong?
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.860]   When does the ski trip belong?
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.860]   And that matters.
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.980]   It may matter more than the what.
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.700]   - I'll give an example that you basically put on a banger
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.940]   of a 50th birthday party,
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.300]   but you decided to just do it when you were 45,
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.460]   because it would be a better experience.
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.500]   To me, that was a big moment.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.660]   It was like, oh, you always think let's do this thing
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.100]   at this milestone in life.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.940]   And you were just like, let's just do it earlier.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.380]   So that I get more out of it.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.460]   - Yeah, there's other smaller examples.
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.940]   I was in an island and guys were gonna go wakeboarding.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.100]   You may have heard me say this.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.260]   And I was like, nah, I'm just gonna chill here,
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.380]   relax, et cetera.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.940]   And I have a degenerative cartilage in L3, L4.
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.180]   And so my wakeboarding days are limited.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.260]   And if I was gonna go wakeboarding,
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.780]   it's not five years from now.
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:00.620]   And then I was like, okay,
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.180]   when is the next time I'm gonna be on an island
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.100]   where it's warm and there's actually a wakeboard
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.940]   and a wakeboard boat with these friends, et cetera,
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.740]   and go wakeboarding that I physically can do it.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.020]   And I quickly came to the conclusion, never.
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.340]   It's now or never.
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.220]   This is the last wakeboarding chance
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.580]   I'm probably gonna have for the rest of my life.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.900]   And so I quickly said, I can lounge on the beach
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.380]   and relax until my 80s.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.500]   I can't go wakeboarding.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.820]   So now is the time to go wakeboarding.
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.340]   So I got on the boat and said, I'm just gonna go do this.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.740]   And that was my last wakeboarding run ever.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.100]   - I have a similar experience, but it wasn't my last.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.580]   I had always, as a kid, been a skateboarder, snowboarder,
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.620]   and I'd always wanted to go wakeboarding.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.900]   And for some reason, just the opportunity never arose.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.780]   And finally, I was like, you know what?
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.700]   I'm not getting to the point
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.260]   that I couldn't wakeboard in five years,
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.540]   but I'm getting to the point
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.300]   that if I wanna try to do crazy stuff on a wakeboard,
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.620]   I probably should do it now.
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.460]   - Yeah.
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.300]   - And then we rented a boat.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.140]   My brother-in-law and I went out
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.260]   and literally the boat was defective
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.980]   and could not go fast enough to do anything.
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.220]   So I still need to get that checked off my list
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.020]   because we basically were just trolling around on this boat
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.300]   and we got a refund, which was cool,
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.580]   but I still haven't ticked that one off.
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.540]   - And you talk about trying to bucket these things.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.180]   So you have all these ideas in life.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.980]   Your theory is instead of saying, make this big list,
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.020]   you can have a bucket list,
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.020]   but you kind of have this anti-bucket list.
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.460]   So why is bucketing things so different than a bucket list?
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.220]   And why is the distinction important?
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.580]   - I like to go backwards to either zero and infinity
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.100]   to try and get a concept across.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.180]   Just before you were born, you're in heaven,
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.820]   the universe, the matrix, creators, whatever your thing is.
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.660]   And then God says to you,
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.780]   what experiences do you wanna have
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.340]   on your journey on planet earth?
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.220]   You have 86 years, 79 years, whatever it is,
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.300]   what experiences you wanna have?
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.820]   And you go to the hall of experiences,
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.820]   which is really the hall of choices, right?
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.900]   You're like, I wanna go skateboarding this many times,
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.580]   then I'm gonna go traveling, I wanna have kids,
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.860]   I wanna get a degree, I wanna say I love you
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.980]   this many times, every single thing you can think of.
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.180]   I'm gonna donate charities, I'm gonna whatever.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.620]   You throw it into your infinite bucket of experiences.
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.600]   It's not infinite because you're a human, et cetera.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.340]   God goes, great, you can have all those experiences.
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.740]   There's only one problem, you have to get the order right.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.900]   And so the guy who puts the like, I wanna go hella skiing
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.260]   and puts it in the 80 to 85 bucket,
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.140]   probably doesn't get to go hella skiing, right?
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.820]   'Cause our decisions are dynamic,
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.260]   our body has a health curve, utility curve,
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.340]   and certain things belong in certain areas.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.300]   So I'd pick like kind of these cartoon exaggerated examples
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:31.300]   of the why the timing matters, what experiences belong when,
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.220]   but there's tons of them.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.660]   People have kids and they're like,
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.060]   oh, I'm gonna hang out with my kids
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.500]   when they're 13 or 14 more.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.140]   We're gonna go this, I'm gonna wait for this.
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.500]   And your kids don't wanna know you when you're 13 and 14,
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.100]   or they don't wanna do the same activities
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.940]   when you're younger.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.640]   And people are very acutely aware of how they spend time
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.520]   with their kids and what activities they can do
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.100]   with their kids at certain periods in their life
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.180]   and certain seasons of life.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.740]   But that applies to everyone, in every relationship,
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.580]   even business, your health, spiritual, et cetera.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.740]   And not only are there limits,
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.540]   there's your attitude changes,
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.460]   certain experiences are orthogonal to other experiences.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.820]   My flag football days are done, man.
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.420]   I'm not trying to pull a hamstring twist, a knee, et cetera,
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.220]   because of my body, the recovery time.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.160]   Not that I can't do it,
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.700]   not that it wouldn't be fun while I'm doing it,
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.740]   but it would be less enjoyable afterwards.
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.540]   And it wouldn't be as enjoyable,
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.860]   let's say in my 20s or 30s.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.660]   Like, hey, let's go play football after work.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.100]   Now, I would never say that now, right?
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.220]   Never ever, right?
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.740]   So if I had in my bucket of experiences,
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.700]   that had to happen in the 20 to 33 bucket.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.160]   - We haven't talked about memory dividends,
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.220]   but I think it's interesting because
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.760]   just because you did that in your 30s
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.020]   doesn't mean you don't get value out of it
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.540]   in your 40s or your 50s or your 60s.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.980]   It's just something I'd never seen or heard
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.020]   or thought about, which was you could stack these memories
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.340]   throughout the rest of your life
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.040]   if you actually do them and enjoy them
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.100]   and document them maybe to enhance it.
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.320]   - Yeah, the purpose of money is to fulfill your life, right?
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.660]   It's for your consumption.
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.140]   You wanna use all your resources that you have,
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.260]   your wealth and health and time
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.900]   to get the maximum fulfillment.
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.220]   Let's just go with that.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.060]   I always ask people this, what are you saving for?
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.660]   They'll give me some abstract, like retirement.
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:10.500]   I'm like, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.500]   Like house, home, whatever, okay, I'll give you survival.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.820]   Once your survival is covered, what are you saving for?
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.380]   I wanna know exactly in your mind, what are you saving for?
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.400]   Sometimes people will give me a very definitive answer
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.140]   of like, I wanna take this trip, I wanna go to the opera,
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.860]   I wanna be able to take a cruise every single year
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.960]   of my life from 66 to the grave or whatever it is.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.700]   But a lot of times it's in abstract land.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.180]   It's just this autopilot answer.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.580]   And when you save money,
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.460]   it's attached to some future consumption or experience.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.200]   And that experience is going to give you
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.140]   some sort of fulfillment or joy.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.780]   When you consume an experience,
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.580]   you have joy from that experience,
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.860]   but also when you recall that experience
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.100]   and revisit that experience, you get joy from it.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.380]   So it pays a dividend, what I call the memory dividend.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.900]   Anybody who's had a first kiss,
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.940]   hit a game-winning home run,
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.060]   they've told that story over and over again.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.460]   And when they tell that story and they recall that story,
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.940]   they get a sense of fulfillment from it.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.200]   That experience, that original experience
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.960]   is paying a dividend and also creating a new memory.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.940]   As I discussed with you, hey, my backpacking trip
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.180]   or my trip to Asia, et cetera.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.500]   And that adds up to our fulfillment.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.020]   Now you can do it the other way around.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.740]   You can say, well, here is the original experience
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.780]   and here are the dividends
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.740]   and here's the total fulfillment there.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.880]   Or I could put the money in this investment,
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.900]   it will pay dividends, I'll have more money
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.380]   and I'll buy more experiences in the future.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.700]   And we have to weigh these two things out to optimize it.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.900]   Is it better to take one ski trip now
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.020]   with my friends and buddies
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.180]   or two ski trips 10 years from now?
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.420]   Because the money is for consumption.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.780]   We're going to use it all.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.300]   So the question is, when is the best time to allocate
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.620]   and which provides the total return on fulfillment?
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.860]   What gets me the highest fulfillment?
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.980]   Depending on who you are, what your age is
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.300]   and the things you like,
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.700]   going through that mental exercise
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.940]   may produce different results.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.540]   Me, at 53, a lot of the times,
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.700]   the answer is not two trips 10 years from now.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.260]   It's the activity now plus the dividends
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:23.260]   will surely exceed two of the activity later in life.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.640]   You can just calculate what that return is.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.300]   - Is it as simple as a rule of thumb
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.820]   where it's like for however many years in the future,
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.660]   this thing will be a memory?
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.540]   It is worth, I don't know, 10% more every year.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.840]   Is there some simple math?
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.340]   - I would put it to you and your followers
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.100]   and be like, hey, we're going to run a calculator
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.660]   and you can put in your health degradation,
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.100]   all these formulas and we'll give you a better idea
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.180]   of what it's going to be worth to you
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.500]   later in life versus now.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.300]   But for me, I just deeply think about it.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.100]   Like I sit down, like wakeboarding.
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.860]   There is no future wakeboarding, right?
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.900]   It might've been two wakeboarding trips later,
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.500]   spend the money, be with your friends, et cetera.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.540]   But generally, as you get older,
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.340]   I think the answer is like when you're 20, 22,
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:08.660]   maybe two ski trips, two and a half ski trips at 30
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.860]   is a much better deal.
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.860]   You're more mature, you'll have your stuff together,
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.780]   other things been going on, I'll have some friends,
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.980]   it'll be bigger and better, I can afford the upgrade,
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.500]   whatever, maybe it's a better trip.
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.620]   For me at 53, two ski trips is not the answer.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.140]   - I went on this trip, my wife and I,
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.500]   and I hadn't read your book, so somehow I had this spark
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.580]   of let's quit our jobs and let's spend all our savings
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.940]   and let's backpack around the world for seven months.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.620]   And we did this in our 20s.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.620]   I am 100% certain that the money that we spent
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.820]   wouldn't even buy one trip around the world for two months
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.620]   now that we have a different lifestyle,
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.020]   we have kids and all this stuff.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.700]   So I think it's especially interesting for someone
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.980]   in their 20s or early 30s, foregoing that trip now
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.500]   isn't gonna let your money grow to be two trips
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.380]   because I'm almost certain that by the time that money
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.220]   is enough for the two trips, the cost of a trip
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.940]   is gonna be twice or three times as much,
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.820]   it might not even be enough to go on one.
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.180]   - You're including also the economic inflation of the trip,
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.060]   also the fact that you become more bougie as you get older.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.940]   Like it's hard to do the youth hostel backpacking thing
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.900]   as you get older.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.100]   That's not even a physical thing,
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.660]   that's like your attitude changes.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.740]   You realize that certain activities,
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.420]   going back to this time bucketing, belong in your 20s
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.980]   and they don't transfer well to your 30s.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.780]   Now you may be able to do them,
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.420]   but it's just not as enjoyable
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.300]   or it'll cost infinite more money or whatever it is.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.220]   And that the 20s activity,
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.940]   not only do you get to enjoy it more,
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.780]   but you get to enjoy the discussion,
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.380]   the memories, the conversation,
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.700]   it's the thing that makes you interesting.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.740]   Like when I sit down and talk with somebody at a dinner,
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.020]   I just met them.
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.340]   I'd say 80% of the conversation is what have they done?
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.620]   What experiences that they have?
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.940]   What were their learnings?
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.260]   What has been their journey?
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.180]   And maybe 20% is what they're going to do
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.020]   or what's going on currently, et cetera.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.540]   And that is what drives your fulfillment
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.500]   when you're meeting somebody.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.820]   It makes you an interesting character.
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.380]   And so getting the order right and figuring out,
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.300]   hey, is it worth it to delay or not,
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.140]   is a very personal thing.
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.140]   And it's very dependent on which activities
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.620]   or things fulfill you.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.460]   But it's definitely the thought process
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.820]   that you wanna go through.
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.980]   - My takeaway so far is don't necessarily focus
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.940]   on accumulating money to all extent
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.420]   because you can use that money earlier
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.100]   to create experiences that provide value
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.180]   the rest of your life.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.820]   - If the purpose is I'm gonna get the max value
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.140]   and I say the max value is fulfillment,
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.860]   you gotta change your optimization algorithm in your head
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.780]   to optimize for fulfillment.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.780]   A lot of people keep optimizing for money
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.780]   and I'm like, listen, okay,
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.780]   why don't you optimize for the most money at 86?
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.820]   And they'll obviously will go, no, that's dumb.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.780]   Well, it's the same thing is true at 85 or 84 or 83
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.580]   or any year we should be optimizing for fulfillment.
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.700]   Money is just a tool for your fulfillment.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.220]   You are not a tool to make money.
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.220]   And a lot of people operating in the latter, not the former.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.180]   - I wanna come back to identifying that,
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.340]   but there's a couple of things on bucketing experiences
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.180]   and memoring them.
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.380]   So we had a wedding as many people do
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.860]   and we paid for a photographer, videographer,
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.540]   although many people that have listened
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.860]   know that we negotiated to pay for the videographer
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.500]   by swapping frequent flyer miles instead of dollars
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.580]   'cause we wanted to get a deal.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:24.000]   But looking back, that video has not been seen
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.020]   by millions of people, it's friends and family
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.180]   and we've watched it every few years.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:32.340]   But I think it's really reinforced the memory of the wedding
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.660]   and the photos do the same.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.960]   I'm curious if there are any other tactics
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.820]   that can enhance the dividends that our memories pay
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.500]   so that we can get more value of them after we have them.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.500]   - I think technology is doing something wonderful.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.340]   Google photos or iPhones will do this.
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.540]   They'll be on this date and then photos will pop up
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.540]   of what happens and then you get joy out of that
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.860]   and it sparks a conversation.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.100]   You get fulfillment from an experience that you had
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.420]   and the recall of it.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.940]   So it's triggering and tapping in to your memory dividend,
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.900]   to your memories to provide you value.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.460]   One of the gifts my fiance at the time gave me was a box
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.680]   and it had photos and memories and little comments
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.480]   on what it was and I was like, this is the best gift.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.620]   Close to zero cost of any kind of purchase, et cetera.
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.660]   Paper, cards, some photos printed out, et cetera
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.740]   and her perspective.
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.440]   But it was amazing on how much joy it was
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.900]   and really I was just mining the prior experience
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.000]   and experience dividend.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.340]   If somebody comes up with another tool or another idea
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.260]   or another method, I'm open to it.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.180]   I really wanna mine the memory dividend
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.920]   and get the most out of my investments.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.980]   And my investments are, I invest in experiences
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.440]   'cause that's what fulfills me.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.540]   Just like Warren Buffet says,
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.740]   when do you start investing?
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.640]   Early, now, now, now.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.700]   In order to get the maximum, what I call memory dividend,
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.700]   maximum return.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.820]   - Everyone says compound interest is so important,
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.500]   you should invest as early as you can
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.100]   to have the most money possible.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.220]   You're saying, I have the same principle.
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.940]   It's just I'm not optimizing for money.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.180]   So invest, invest, invest as early as possible
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.480]   in the kinds of experiences
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.980]   that will maximize your fulfillment of life.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.340]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.240]   When people are focused on returns
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.300]   and compound interest, et cetera,
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.940]   they're optimizing for maximum money.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.300]   That's a vertical, your wealth, getting your wealth up.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.220]   And there's lots of books and lots of tools, tricks, hacks
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.920]   on how to get the most out of every dollar you spend,
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.100]   how to make the most money, et cetera.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.700]   But I'm at a top level optimization.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.420]   I'm at a much higher optimization
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.480]   on like your life fulfillment, your net fulfillment.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.220]   And the memory dividend is a huge calculation in it.
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.180]   And I really encourage people to invest
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.580]   in making those memory dividends
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.660]   or at least think about that when you're deciding
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.980]   whether to delay gratification
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.980]   or actually have gratification now.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.420]   - One thing that's helped me in this is
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.980]   if you think about the marginal dollar that you're saving,
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.380]   and so often I hear people,
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.920]   this is probably people with a little more money,
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.020]   but they're like, oh, well, I should save more money.
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.860]   And I'm like, well, why?
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.380]   And they're like, well, then I'll have more money
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.420]   and I get a higher net worth.
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.420]   And I said, well, what's that next marginal dollar
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.580]   gonna do for you?
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.700]   Because people always say,
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.000]   well, if I save an extra thousand dollars a month,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.020]   that's my kid's college.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.620]   And it's like, well, do you already have
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.540]   your kid's college saved?
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.660]   'Cause if so, then what's that extra dollar doing?
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.220]   And would that extra dollar actually be better spent today?
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.220]   - Yeah, going back to, I try and get people
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.820]   to map their money to what the consumption is.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:17.980]   A lot of people saving, they're like,
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:18.920]   oh, I'm saving, I'm working.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.620]   I'm like, listen, it's okay to save.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.500]   Just tell me what the party is and when's the party.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.580]   Just tell me when the party is.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.580]   I'm okay with it.
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.040]   Like it gets them thinking like, well, 65?
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.040]   No, that's not really when I have the party.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.380]   Wait, what kind of party do I have?
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.220]   What are the things I really wanna do?
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.260]   Because what happens is, I believe,
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.960]   is people get habituated.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.820]   They get really good at optimizing for money,
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.940]   making money, doing deals, whatever it is they are,
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.460]   programmers, et cetera, and they keep piling it.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.820]   And much like a rat in a wheel with the cheese experiment,
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.340]   pretty soon you can just show them the wheel
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.420]   and not give them the cheese.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.340]   There's no reward.
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.180]   And so people are in default mode network
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.780]   of accumulating wealth, making money,
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.500]   earning money, optimizing money.
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.220]   I read the book on how to save on this.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.180]   I got 18 million flea-quit-flyer miles.
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.180]   I discounted that.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.540]   Look at all these Chuck E. Cheese tokens I got.
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.220]   And then they die with a bunch of Chuck E. Cheese tokens
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.220]   and never really go to Chuck E. Cheese.
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.500]   And I'm like, when you going to Chuck E. Cheese?
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.340]   You know?
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.620]   You've been running in this rat wheel, right?
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.060]   You got all these tickets, everything,
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.260]   but what are we buying here?
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.380]   What are we saving for?
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:29.280]   And I think people become detached
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.940]   from what their original dream was,
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.300]   what they really wanted to do,
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.760]   such that the game and the puzzle solving,
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.820]   people become addicted to the puzzle of saving more money
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.860]   as opposed to being addicted to the puzzle
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.980]   of how do I fulfill my life?
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.140]   What potluck thing am I going to do?
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.060]   How do I expose myself to other things?
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.820]   What choices should I be making today?
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.500]   What experiences do I want in this time period of my life
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.660]   and the next time period of life?
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.740]   And how do those fit together?
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.080]   They're more focused on a different puzzle.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.060]   - When it comes to these bucketing of experiences,
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.600]   is there a number of years that you say,
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.100]   well, try to bucket them in tranches of five years
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.500]   or 10 years, or how do you think about that?
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.180]   So people can actually go home and be like,
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.340]   let's start doing this today.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.820]   - I try and do five years.
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:17.260]   Like when I got to my 65, I broke it out 65 to 75.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.100]   It gets wider.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.420]   And obviously the further you go in future,
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.840]   the less your visibility, even for yourself.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.940]   Like, okay, you have 53 to 58.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:26.860]   This is what I want to do.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.700]   I want to do this.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.520]   I want to take a train.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.980]   I'm going to go to my daughter's graduation.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.180]   I want to stay healthy.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.180]   I want to go on a trip.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.380]   I want to go to Tokyo again.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.140]   I have all those things kind of down, right?
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.140]   And then the next five years it gets harder.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.900]   I kind of think I want to be doing this, right?
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.580]   They're a little bit more thematic.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:44.060]   And then 65, 75, 75 to the grave,
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.620]   it gets even more thematic.
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.900]   But I can tell you that when I look at those choices,
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.900]   when I try and time bucket my life,
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.100]   I can see the level of activity going down.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.980]   I see it harder for me to spend money.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.340]   It's like, visit grandchildren, hang out with daughters,
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.340]   read the books I haven't read.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.620]   It's not like go raging, stay up till 7 a.m.
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.580]   in a club in Tokyo, travel here, swim that.
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.740]   If you could perfectly lay out the experiences
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.420]   you wanted to have, which you can't,
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.960]   you would see this natural curve
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.340]   in the cost of those experiences,
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.420]   this natural consumption pattern.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.820]   And then you start to say, well,
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.420]   I don't want to give up hours of my life
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.820]   for a bunch of Chuck E. Cheese tokens
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.380]   that I'm not gonna use, so I'm gonna go to Chuck E. Cheese.
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:28.380]   And then you start to lay out,
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.820]   well, I'm probably gonna go to Chuck E. Cheese a lot here.
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.780]   I'll play the Whack-A-Mole game, that costs a lot,
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.620]   and I'll do whatever.
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.820]   And then another time, I'm just gonna sit around
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.020]   and eat pizza.
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.820]   And then you have this nice, beautiful curve
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.040]   on consuming and spending your money down to zero
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.540]   as you have the most fulfilling Chuck E. Cheese experience.
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.020]   Basically the most fulfilling life.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.460]   Now I don't know why I'm stuck on Chuck E. Cheese,
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.580]   but I am for some reason.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.500]   - This is strange, but two nights ago,
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.940]   we talked about Chuck E. Cheese randomly,
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.140]   and I was showing our au pair from Spain
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.060]   what Chuck E. Cheese was, because she was like,
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.260]   I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.740]   I was like, man, Chuck E. Cheese has kind of become
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.900]   a more depressing place than I remember it in my childhood.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.620]   You're talking about it, I'm like, oh man,
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.020]   don't want to be the Chuck E. Cheese guy.
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.220]   Don't want to be going there in my 50s.
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.540]   - It's kind of, to me, like cold water.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.540]   It was like going into the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.580]   I was like, wow, I used to go in here as a kid all the time.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:14.420]   Like, no problem.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.260]   Now it's freezing.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.300]   I would never go in there.
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.020]   That's kind of like an activity if you were in heaven.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.940]   It's like go swimming and frolicking
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:21.940]   and body surfing in the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.140]   You're probably not going to enjoy it
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.460]   as much as when you were nine or five
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.380]   and immune to the cold for whatever reason,
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.860]   because it was just so wee,
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.460]   to when you're like 20 something,
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.740]   you're like, this is freezing.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.780]   Like, why am I here?
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:33.620]   That type of thing.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.180]   - Are there any experiences that maybe you regret
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.620]   not doing more of younger,
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.780]   or things that people listening in their 20s and 30s
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.580]   should maybe prioritize more?
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.180]   - Yeah, I think it's very personal,
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.900]   and it has to do with like travel,
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.660]   that kind of backpacking experience,
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.740]   that kind of gap year thing that people do.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.980]   I just really didn't take advantage of that time period.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.220]   I was so focused on trying to get ahead
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.300]   and make money and not taking breaks
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.780]   and was on this autopilot of like, must succeed.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.740]   And not saying that wasn't a great focus
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.180]   and didn't help me get to here,
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.660]   but the success I want is the most fulfilling life.
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.180]   And I gave up things that would have been
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.460]   extremely fulfilling, not only then,
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.900]   but now as I look back on my life.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.220]   And that's going to be different for everybody.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.540]   I'd be like, oh, I wish I went to go play
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.420]   in this chess tournament.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.580]   It could be anything.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.660]   I knew at an early age that travel and meeting new cultures
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.900]   and doing adventurous things really fulfills me.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.420]   I really enjoy that.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.060]   And I did not take advantage of those opportunities
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.580]   that I had.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.100]   I didn't really think about the context.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:34.940]   I'm like, you know what?
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.660]   I can go to a club in Manhattan any day.
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.380]   I can hang out in this weekend any day.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.020]   Like, why don't I get the Super Saver ticket,
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.740]   go here for the weekend, come back, et cetera.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:44.820]   That type of thing.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.580]   - I was really lucky because I got laid off in 2008.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.220]   And so I didn't have a job.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.940]   And my wife was working at a company
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.620]   that she just absolutely hated
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.580]   and didn't want to stay in that field.
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.780]   And so we kind of got forced in this situation
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.700]   where she was like, well, I'm going to quit my job
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.780]   and I don't know what's next.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.500]   And I already didn't have a job.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.620]   So we ended up taking this trip for, I don't know,
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.700]   seven months backpacking, just as you describe.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.220]   But I think it would have been so much harder
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.980]   had at least one of us not been forced out of a job
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.780]   and kind of pushed into this.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.060]   And so what I'm curious to get your take on is
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.860]   the culture of work in America, at least,
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.780]   and probably many other countries,
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.180]   makes it so hard to be like, let's take a year off.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.740]   And now I'm thinking in 30s and 40s,
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.940]   let's cut back so I'm not grinding so hard.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.260]   Or my wife's thinking in her career,
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.780]   she's like, oh, wow, if I ever got another job,
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.100]   like it's got to level it up, got to level it up.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.500]   Whereas usually leveling it up
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.300]   is more responsibility and more time.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.740]   How can people in the work environment
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.780]   you've created in this country still live to these ideals
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.740]   and not get caught in that hamster wheel?
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.580]   - Wow, it's really tough to escape your culture, right?
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.020]   It's extremely tough.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.980]   Culture changes slowly.
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.620]   Regards to work and optimizing for
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.140]   not being afraid of running out of money and status
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.300]   and having more and more money,
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.220]   it's really hard to step back and go,
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.420]   wait, does this serve me?
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.100]   Does this serve my one and only life that I have?
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.260]   Is this really going to fulfill me?
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:18.900]   Or have I become a robot hamster in a wheel,
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.780]   grinding and puzzle addicted to solving this puzzle
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.740]   called more money, more status, more fame, et cetera.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:25.780]   I call that autopilot.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.660]   I say, we're always on autopilot.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.540]   I'm on autopilot just as much as the next person.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.420]   And we have to snap out of it and be like,
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.940]   what really fulfills me?
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.740]   What do I really want out of life?
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.060]   What do I really want out of life
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.580]   out of these next five years?
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.340]   We're so trained, like I want the promotion
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.180]   and I want the thing.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.180]   Well, why do you want the promotion?
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.060]   Because the promotion, the thing, and I have more money.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.860]   Well, why do you want the more money?
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.900]   'Cause the more money is better, the thing.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.100]   It's all the way down.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.820]   It's so inculcated into us about success.
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.420]   Success is more money.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.180]   And it's so abstract that we lose the final connection
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.780]   that money is an abstract.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.620]   It's a tool.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.460]   It's like a hammer and a saw.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.380]   Builders don't want hammers and saws
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.060]   because they love hammers and saws.
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.020]   They want hammers and saws to build houses.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.380]   That is the goal.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.900]   They're not like, must accumulate more hammers and saws,
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.940]   more hammers and saws.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:14.860]   This is how people are.
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.340]   They're like, we must accumulate more money
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.700]   to have more money, to more money, money, money.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.380]   And I'm like, no life, motherfucker.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.700]   We're here to fulfill your life.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.620]   You are solving the wrong problem.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.900]   You're optimizing for the wrong problem.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:33.500]   And culture has pretty much jammed that on everyone.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.500]   Really hard because there's this fear of not having money.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.580]   You don't want to run out of money.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.980]   And fear of retirement is this whole fear game
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.300]   with retirement.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:44.100]   People ask, why do old people keep growing their wealth
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:44.940]   while they're older?
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.460]   And I'm just like, they can't spend it down.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:47.460]   Life is passing by.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.580]   That's the cold hard truth.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.780]   I'm really harsh about that.
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.460]   I'm like, they fucked it up.
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.740]   That's why they can't spend it down.
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.300]   They fucked it up.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.140]   And it's too late for them.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.900]   My book, these algorithms, these mental models
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.940]   are to help you not fuck it up as much.
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.140]   We're all gonna fuck it up a little bit.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.220]   Like, it can't be perfect,
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.340]   but it's like, let's not fuck it up.
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.780]   - Hey everyone, Amy here, Chris's wife.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.500]   I convinced him to let me do this today
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.940]   because I am truly obsessed with Viorey
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.540]   and I'm so excited they're partnering for this episode.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.260]   Viorey makes performance apparel
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.580]   that's designed to work out in,
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.780]   but also looks great in everyday life outside of the gym.
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:26.220]   It is so versatile, buttery soft, and stylish
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.220]   that I wear it out to drinks with friends,
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:32.020]   on morning runs, to work meetings, and when I'm traveling.
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.180]   Honestly, I'm decked out in Viorey every single day
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.420]   because why choose between comfort and style
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.700]   when you can have both?
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.020]   Some of my favorites are the daily leggings,
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:44.500]   the mudra fitted tee, and the Sunday performance joggers.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.980]   In fact, if you all do nothing else,
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.380]   get their Sunday performance joggers.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.540]   Hands down, they're incredible.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.140]   They come in men's and women's,
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.820]   and they are the best article of clothing I own.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.540]   I've also gifted Viorey to friends and family enough now
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.180]   to know that it's my go-to gift
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.380]   because it's always going to be a winner.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.220]   Pro tip with the holidays coming up.

[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:29.420]   - I use Daffy to organize all my giving
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.860]   and charitable tax savings in one place,
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.700]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.980]   for this episode.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.940]   Daffy is a new modern way to give
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.620]   that makes it so much easier
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.900]   to maximize your charitable deductions,
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.300]   especially before the upcoming December 31st deadline.
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.980]   And pro tip, you should always donate appreciated stocks,
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.480]   ETFs, or crypto over cash if you can.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.940]   You'll avoid paying capital gains taxes,
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.340]   and you'll immediately claim the full value
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.940]   as a charitable deduction in the year you make the donation.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.780]   Plus, the charity gets more money
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.560]   when you donate the stock directly
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.460]   because they never have to pay the capital gains tax either,
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.180]   so it's a win-win.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:12.060]   Daffy makes it easy to donate stocks, ETFs, or crypto
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.160]   to nearly any charity, nonprofit, place of worship,
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.280]   or school in the US.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.500]   To learn more about charitable tax savings
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.080]   and to make all your tax-deductible donations
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.340]   before year-end in one place,
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.420]   go to allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.260]   Also, it's free to get started,
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.620]   and there is a special offer
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.380]   when you donate stocks, ETFs, or crypto this year.
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:38.060]   Just go to allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.500]   - I worked with this woman whose job is to kind of
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.700]   help people take their outlook on life
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.060]   that might have some different
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.540]   unconventional contrarian thoughts
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.300]   and really boil it down to some frameworks, a model.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.580]   And we kind of arrived at like my nine principles
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.820]   of living an optimized life,
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.620]   and I'm not ready to share them all yet,
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.060]   but one of them was questioning
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.060]   the outcome you actually want.
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:58.940]   And I wanna bring it up
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.140]   because of what you just said earlier.
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.740]   Met someone who said, "Gosh, I need more money."
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.020]   And I was like, "Why do you need more money?"
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.700]   And they said, "I wanna spend more time with my kids,
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.700]   "and if I have more money, I'll be able to retire sooner
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.060]   "and spend more time with my kids."
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.780]   And through this conversation, we were like,
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.420]   "What if you had a different job
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.000]   "that earned you a little less money,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.940]   "but gave you the freedom to work four days a week,
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:16.920]   "and now you have a whole day
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.840]   "that you could spend more time with your kids
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.220]   "and you weren't grinding as hard?"
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.580]   And they're like, "Well, then I wouldn't have any money."
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.380]   And I was like, "You don't need the more money anymore
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.780]   "because you don't need to retire early
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.560]   "to spend your time with your kids at 50.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.220]   "You could start spending it now."
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.380]   And in product management, when we're building software
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.900]   and talking to customers, we always ask the five whys.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.060]   So if someone says, "Oh, I want this."
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.880]   And it's like, you gotta ask why five times
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.140]   before you actually understand what someone wants.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.500]   So I'll challenge people thinking they want more money
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.420]   to go through that thought experiment themselves
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.780]   of being like, "Why do you want the more money?"
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:46.180]   And drill down, and then ask yourself,
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.540]   "Is there actually, once you get to that fifth why,
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.600]   "a way you could achieve what you want
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.100]   "that actually isn't about just accumulating more money?"
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.140]   And I would argue that more often than not,
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.260]   the answer will be yes.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.500]   - The book, "Your Money or Your Life"
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.820]   kinda hits on this concept of enough,
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.500]   and what are you really solving for?
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.700]   You're doing like spend more time with your kids,
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.220]   but I'm making more money, save time with your kids.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.580]   But if you make more money, are they really kids then?
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.060]   Do they wanna spend time with you?
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.380]   There's a lot of variables going on,
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.380]   but going through that thought experiment,
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.820]   you actually get to pull out more from them.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.540]   They're like, "It's really about the status.
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.260]   "It's really because you've been habituated
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.460]   "into making more money."
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.960]   There may be this desire to spend more time with your kids,
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.220]   but it's not the real reason.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.980]   There's other reasons, whether they be habit
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.740]   or some sort of goal, et cetera, that we gotta address.
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.380]   We gotta look at and be like, do those reasons serve you?
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:33.540]   - What would you say to someone,
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.660]   let's say in their mid-30s, who's got a great job
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.820]   and looking to do something new
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.460]   and feeling like the only option is to go take
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.300]   that next level up job that's gonna be higher pay
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.980]   and more responsibility and probably limit their ability
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:50.380]   to have the kinds of experiences they want
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.940]   because they're so engulfed in work,
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.180]   but they're stressed out because they feel like
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:58.220]   doing anything else would be a downgrade in their career.
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.660]   How would you talk them through that?
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.660]   - The main thing is what are we solving for?
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.740]   And all of them, the first variable, the second variable,
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.860]   and the third variable, and how can we max them out?
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.760]   They're like, "Oh, I wanna actually spend time
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.340]   "and have more fun and do X, Y, and Z."
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.020]   And I'd be like, "Well, okay, this is one of 'em."
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:13.380]   I'm gonna be my own insurance agent.
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.420]   I talk about that in a book,
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:17.500]   like people try and basically be their own insurance agent
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.980]   by saving enough money for every single calamity.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.460]   That's their backup default skew.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.620]   Well, just what if this happens?
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.460]   What if that happens?
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.900]   I try and find these things
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.800]   that they're actually solving for
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.060]   and then help them make the decision
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.740]   on what's the best decision for them.
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:30.940]   We may come to the conclusion
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.860]   that taking on more responsibility now
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.540]   because the job pays so much damn money
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.020]   and then quitting in a year
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.260]   will actually lead to more fulfillment and more fun,
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.340]   and then I'll quit and I'll goof off and do whatever.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.220]   The stock options are gonna go into money
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:43.540]   and I'm gonna make a zillion dollars
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.980]   and I'm gonna have seven years of just bliss
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.860]   and goofing off as opposed to grinding it out
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.940]   five years in this lower-paying job, et cetera.
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.260]   I'd have 100% of the time.
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.760]   But that's usually the rarity in these scenarios.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.600]   - And they never quit.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.540]   - Yeah, they never quit.
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.500]   It's like, you don't have to quit your job.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.420]   You just have to consume the fruits of your labor.
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.140]   You have to get everything.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.460]   You have to find your balance.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.540]   You can love what you do,
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:11.880]   but you should also be able to do what you love.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.840]   A lot of people went to work 'cause they wanted a house
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.900]   and they wanted to have kids
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.740]   and they wanted to travel and they wanted to ski
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.660]   and they wanted to start a rock band
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.780]   or some expensive hobby with telescopes or whatever it is.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.260]   And somewhere along the way,
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.460]   those things kind of fall to the wayside.
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.660]   They don't exist anymore.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.220]   And it's the money and whatever.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.940]   And we kind of instinctively attack some sort of reason.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.100]   Oh, the kids.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.340]   I'm gonna spend more time on my kids.
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.140]   I'm like, nah, no, you don't.
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.940]   That's not what you're solving for with this job.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.700]   Or at least this equation doesn't compute.
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.540]   If they were my friends, like real close friends,
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.460]   I'm like, no, you don't.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.060]   You're bullshitting yourself.
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.860]   You can lie to me, but just don't lie to yourself.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.260]   And then we go through it.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.300]   And a more gentle approach is
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.380]   let's just see if this formula computes.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.340]   Let's put it up on the board.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.300]   Let's map out the time.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.640]   Get really detailed.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.260]   Like, okay, how much more money are you gonna get?
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:04.740]   When are you gonna have the time?
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.140]   How much more spare time are you gonna have?
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.060]   When does this happen?
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:07.980]   Is your kid still a kid?
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.460]   Do they still wanna hang out with you?
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.840]   Okay, what's this other job?
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.500]   No two-hour commute.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.180]   That's two hours a day you can have your kids.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.520]   Well, it seems like if we're solving for time with the kid,
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.420]   this job may be better than this job
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.640]   because the money you accumulate,
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.100]   you really don't have the time to spend it
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.020]   'cause you're working harder
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.540]   and you have more responsibilities
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.740]   and it's in the future and your kid's not a kid anymore.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.580]   And they're gone.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.900]   We might come to that conclusion
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.780]   depending on what we put on the board.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.540]   So much like you do, you're digging in.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.500]   If I switch this and I fly this plane
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.900]   and I do this on Tuesday,
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.340]   I get the most frequent flyer miles.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.820]   You're optimizing for the most miles.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.900]   I will look at a trip as like,
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.980]   yeah, miles is one of the things I'm optimizing for,
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.880]   but ultimately I'm optimizing for the best fucking trip
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.420]   and the most memory dividends
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.340]   and the most fulfillment out of this trip.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.700]   So that's number one priority and number two is the miles.
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:56.940]   - I think when we went to South Africa
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:57.820]   for this trip around the world,
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.340]   we had like five layovers because we stopped one place,
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.620]   then we changed planes and the plane landed in Sudan,
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.860]   but we couldn't even get off the plane.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.700]   So we just sat there until it took off again
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.060]   and all this stuff.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.820]   Now I'm like, how can I get there with zero to one stop?
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.420]   If it's really far, one stop,
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.060]   if it's really close, zero stops.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.940]   And that's forced me to reprioritize what I want.
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:17.940]   I wanna talk about a few things.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:18.820]   How do we implement this?
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.900]   But maybe first, some of the common objections
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.660]   to changing this.
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.060]   So two things you talked about.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.900]   One is preventing running out of money.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.940]   I think everyone I know is like,
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.340]   oh, I wanna make sure I have enough.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.580]   What if I live to 110?
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.000]   What if health gets so great that I'm living forever?
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.800]   What do you tell to people who are trying to optimize
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.080]   for every possible thing that could happen?
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.200]   How to just get either comfortable with the risk
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.040]   that they don't need it
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.700]   or you've even mentioned the book,
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.220]   like just get an annuity.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.660]   - If you're worried about running out of money,
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.540]   get an annuity.
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.740]   Get the reverse of life insurance.
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:49.820]   Everybody gets life insurance, right?
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:50.740]   They're like, I have life insurance.
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:51.940]   If I die early, et cetera.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.820]   Well, if you're worried about living too long,
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.040]   it's the exact opposite.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.380]   They have an insurance product for that.
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.220]   Or they're worried about what if I need nurses
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.060]   or whatever.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:02.820]   I'm like, long-term healthcare insurance is pretty cheap.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:03.960]   It's actually very cheap
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.980]   because I think one of the reasons is
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.000]   when you need those nurses, you're on your way out.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.340]   They're not gonna be paying that long,
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.300]   but it's pretty cheap,
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.060]   particularly if you get it while you're younger,
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:12.900]   30s and 40s.
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.420]   It's actually trivial for people,
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.660]   the wealth category that you're talking about.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:20.340]   I look at things that people are acting
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.100]   as an insurance agent inefficiently,
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.620]   and I'm like, let's be more efficient
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.700]   on how we insure away these risks.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.780]   And it might be an insurance product, et cetera.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:29.740]   And some of the things that,
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.740]   let's say there's not an insurance product
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:32.980]   or whatever their fear of,
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.980]   I try and convert their fear of,
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.420]   you should fear wasting your life
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.900]   more than you fear running out of money.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.560]   I try and redirect them to that.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.980]   What are the things you wanna have?
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:45.220]   What experience you wanna have when this is your life,
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:48.020]   you will die, it doesn't go on forever.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.980]   What is urgent to you?
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.260]   And what is urgent for each period?
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.460]   When we have that conversation in my presence
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.300]   and their presence while I think about it,
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.140]   and you're like, yeah, you're right.
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.980]   The key is to keep them on that
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.540]   because you have that conversation and they go back
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.540]   and they're right back on the autopilot.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.740]   Let's go run in the wheel
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.020]   'cause it's fun to run in the wheel.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.620]   No tease, no reward, no fulfilling life,
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.240]   just a battery, a robot,
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.680]   a cog in a wheel for the economic system.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.400]   I implore them to stay focused on,
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:19.360]   always attach your efforts to what the goal,
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.840]   what the consumption is.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:24.480]   So that is how I get them on the goal.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.060]   And in every single objection,
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.280]   whether it's what if I live too long?
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.460]   What if I need long-term care insurance, et cetera?
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.360]   There is a way to minimize that risk
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.460]   or mitigate that risk more efficiently
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.000]   than the way they are doing it right now
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.120]   because honestly, they've just been doing it on autopilot.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.920]   It's just a backstop reason to back up why they're doing it.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.500]   You know how some behaviors you just do them
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.720]   and then you'll throw a reason after the fact
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:47.920]   on why you're doing it?
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.160]   And you're just doing it because it's on autopilot?
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.160]   That's a lot of those reasons.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.040]   Well, I'm working real hard because of whatever.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.440]   What if I get sick?
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.160]   Like, okay, when you get sick
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.520]   and it's $20,000 a night in the hospital bed,
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.880]   are you really the insurance agent?
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.240]   No, you're buying insurance for that.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.440]   Let's really think this through.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:05.720]   So when you're sitting across someone,
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.560]   sometimes it's a lot of chalkboard work.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.560]   It's a lot of going through it.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.500]   And that's why I tell people like,
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.360]   you need to sit down and think about this honestly
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.760]   with yourself and work through these priorities
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.920]   and what your fear is.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.800]   Let's go one by one to try to mitigate them
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.840]   because if we're solving for the most fulfilling life,
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.040]   everything else is secondary
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.160]   and everything else needs to be solved.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.720]   We wanna consume as much as possible in the right times.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.280]   - And you talk a lot about risk,
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.760]   but is it sometimes that risk is really just fear?
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.680]   - Yeah, it's just fucking fear.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.040]   And a lot of it's fear of embarrassment,
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.160]   fear of running out of money.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.320]   That is like the worst thing for people,
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.600]   not because they can't go get some basic job and survive,
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.980]   just the embarrassment, the status, the ego attached to it.
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.600]   And I guess why, because like, if you run out of money
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.880]   or you were at high status
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.280]   and now you're working at McDonald's say, or whatever,
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.120]   and you get that shame and people mocking you, whatever,
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.600]   if you waste your life and die, nobody's mocking you.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.000]   You can't know, you're dead.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.040]   The people who are alive are like,
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.400]   wow, that fucking guy, what a clown, dude.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.600]   That guy died with $4 billion.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.440]   What a fucking idiot.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.680]   He got completely habituated to be a cog
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.960]   in the fucking wheel.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.240]   Great one, dude.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.520]   Thank you for your service.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.140]   Thank you for putting out all this value,
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.480]   getting a fraction of yourself and never using it.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.240]   And then donating 40% to the US Treasury.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.680]   We fucking love that guy.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.920]   They don't hear that, they're dead.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.440]   But if you somehow go start some business and it fails,
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.920]   you people are like, I told you so,
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.720]   I knew it was gonna happen, shoulda, woulda, coulda,
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.440]   and your ego can't handle that.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.120]   So I always think it's fear,
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.180]   and the fear is not the actual bad thing.
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:48.000]   The fear is the ego associated with the failure.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.200]   But that's just me.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.700]   - It would help if society put more of an emphasis on like,
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.120]   wow, you didn't go and spend your money.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.460]   You didn't go on a trip this year.
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.840]   You did nothing this year.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.240]   - Yeah, somebody said,
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.040]   I put it to a bunch of 20 year olds or a class or something,
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.320]   it's like, who would switch right now with Warren Buffett?
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.520]   None of them, none of them.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.360]   They're like, well, he's got X billion dollars or whatever.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.200]   I don't wanna be that rich and old.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.240]   There's no amount of money you can give me
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.720]   to give up my life.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.400]   So a lot of people are doing some version of this.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.880]   I always tell people, there's no amount of money
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.480]   you can pay me to do five years in Sing Sing.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.000]   Maybe at 19, you could have done it.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.520]   But right now, no amount of money.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.920]   And some people are doing some sort of version of jail,
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.120]   giving up their life for this money.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.680]   - I liked how you reframed someone
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.240]   who wouldn't take the risk to move,
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.840]   to make more money, to do something,
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.840]   as like they're paying to just sit still.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.680]   - Yes.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.000]   - By not taking up an opportunity.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.480]   I like these mindset shifts that you introduce in the book,
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.080]   which is just like, think about it this different way.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.120]   And maybe that'll help you get over that hurdle.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.200]   - Yeah, just quantify it.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.520]   And you may come to the same decision.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.640]   Yes, I'm happy paying the fine sitting here.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.240]   Or you might be like, that's ludicrous.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.040]   I actually would get much more money
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.360]   and I would be able to spend more quality time
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.080]   with the people I love that I'm leaving.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.080]   Than I do right now.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.560]   I've had this conversation with people like,
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.400]   oh, I don't wanna leave New York
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.360]   because my mom's here and so-and-so's here, et cetera.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.160]   I was like, okay, let's break this down.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.520]   How many times do you see them?
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.880]   A week?
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.720]   A month, okay.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:13.560]   Let's write that down.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.080]   How many, all right, whatever.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.320]   And then, okay, what's the money difference?
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.760]   And then what's a plane ticket back and forth?
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.560]   And then you could probably take them on vacation
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.400]   and you spend more time.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:27.240]   So in theory, you can spend more time,
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.480]   more quality time,
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.920]   and make more money,
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:34.200]   expand your contact network, et cetera,
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.440]   with this move,
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.920]   even though you're saying you don't wanna move
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.680]   because of the people that are here.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.120]   And sometimes that formula doesn't work out,
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.560]   but at least you go through the exercise
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:45.080]   and then you know you don't have this future regret.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.720]   Like you have this regret minimization,
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.640]   but like I made the right decision.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.840]   I went through all the avenues, et cetera.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.160]   I actually get more time with my family by staying here.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.200]   Or I've made the right decision.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.000]   I've actually expanded my network,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.080]   have more money,
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.360]   and actually spent more time with the people I love
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.400]   in a better way, in a better format,
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.800]   in a more fulfilling format.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.920]   And so that's the book.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:08.920]   This is the mental model.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.600]   We're solving for net fulfillment.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.720]   - I did an interview episode 40 with Dan Pink,
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.160]   who wrote a book about regret.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.360]   And he talked about like one of the big four regrets
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.800]   is a regret of boldness.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.600]   And people in their old age are like,
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.240]   I just wish when I wanted to do this thing,
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.440]   I went and did it.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.200]   And I almost feel like a default assumption should be
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.400]   instead of when you're thinking, should I move?
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.840]   Should I go on this adventure?
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:31.840]   Should I do this thing?
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.680]   Just try to every time be like, should I not do it?
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.920]   Try to always assume that you're going to do this bold thing
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:40.520]   and see if you could talk yourself out of it
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.160]   instead of talk yourself into it.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.560]   It's not easy,
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.720]   but if you're ever faced with this kind of tough,
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.760]   should I do this big thing?
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.600]   Just try to say, okay, let's assume I do it.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.600]   Why shouldn't I do it?
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.280]   And I think that could help change that mindset.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.760]   'Cause I think it's hard.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.640]   One thing I did once, and you did a similar one,
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.040]   and I think it was more extreme is,
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.120]   I find that if you're ever worried about money,
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.800]   go experience what it's like to make money
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.280]   doing something without a job.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.040]   So for me, my wife was at Lyft and I was like,
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.480]   I'm just gonna sign up for a Lyft driver.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.480]   I did it for two reasons.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.440]   One, it was really rewarding to realize like,
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.640]   I can convert my time to money in a moment.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.920]   If I don't have a job, if I don't have anything,
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.480]   I could still convert it to money.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.800]   The second thing it was good was,
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.600]   it just put probably too low,
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.640]   but it put a threshold on what my time is worth.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.160]   And it helped me realize that like every hour
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.800]   I'm not driving my car around picking people up,
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.560]   I am spending money to not do that,
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.040]   because I could be making money.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.000]   You went panhandling just to try to,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:34.840]   similar experience. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:35.680]   I've done that.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.120]   That was an exercise from an emotional intelligence class.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.840]   I went panhandling and it was really, really, really
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.280]   moving, enlightening, humbling,
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.560]   all these things at the same time.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:46.400]   One, it was like, oh, I can survive.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.760]   Like I can make $54,000 easy panhandling a year.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.640]   That was the kind of annualized, I was running the rate
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.600]   and I didn't even really have a sign or anything.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.920]   I just took my shirt out, put it in size out,
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.480]   rubbed it on the concrete,
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.480]   and then just had a cup on a corner on an intersection.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.920]   And I was like, well, if I was at a busier intersection,
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.320]   you know, I was like doing the calculations, et cetera.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:09.120]   But I was like, I may be in a humbling situation,
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:13.160]   but I can make money just in a panhandling way.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.720]   It was also kind of freeing,
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.080]   but I've always had that risk mindset.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:21.240]   Like I'll always be able to exchange hours of my life
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.600]   for money in order to eat, shelter myself.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.680]   And I don't mean like, hey, I'm living on high on the hog.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.520]   I can get like these cheap ass apartments,
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.920]   these one bedrooms, et cetera.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.240]   I will always be able to do that.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.000]   So it liberates me to go,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.280]   there's really not that much downside.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.320]   It's an ego downside, it's a humbling downside,
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.320]   but there's really not much downside.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.660]   I should be swinging for the motherfucking fences,
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.320]   even more so, like I'm okay with it.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.920]   - You don't really need to insure yourself
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.280]   against the risk that you run out of money
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.300]   because you've now established that like just sitting
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.160]   on the ground can make you money.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.080]   You could do that when you're young,
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.000]   you could do that when you're old.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.760]   If you've established that you can,
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.560]   maybe you're comfortable not saving
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.640]   to insure against every possible risk.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.440]   - There's people out there who insure against these risks
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.280]   that you don't wanna have.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.520]   These bogeymen that do it for less of a cost
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.740]   of you wasting your life.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:07.580]   Like they're more efficient.
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:10.040]   Think, any kind of waste in your time,
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.480]   whether you're exchanging your time for money
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.320]   or your money for time,
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:16.240]   any kind of waste leads to less fulfillment.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.840]   And so you really wanna be like,
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.280]   am I the right person to insure myself
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.660]   against this calamity or should I pay an insurance agent,
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.420]   whatever this fee is, and that will be more efficient,
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:28.320]   result in net fulfillment for me.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.400]   When I look at this activity or whatever,
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.400]   should I be exchanging hours of my life for money
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.200]   or should it be the other way around?
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.020]   What's an hour of my time worth?
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.320]   At this level, at that level, et cetera.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.960]   These are questions we should be asking ourselves
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.800]   all the time.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.840]   Like, is that shirt really worth two hours of my time?
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.880]   Am I gonna get two hours of fulfillment out of it?
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.400]   Does that really fulfill me?
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.840]   You know, that was the beauty of the money or your life
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.680]   is that it really connected me with my values.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.840]   It really made me think what I want out of life,
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.840]   what I'm willing to give up an hour of my life for or not.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:03.280]   And then also hit home that I really want a value
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.400]   of hour of my time to be extremely high.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.960]   I went the other way so that I didn't have to worry about it.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.920]   But even after like, I'd not have to worry about it,
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.720]   now let's say I have all these resources called wealth
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.120]   and I have my health,
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.000]   how am I gonna allocate this over my life
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.560]   to get the max fulfillment?
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:18.400]   That was the next step.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.560]   I was like, great, now I'm rich.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.880]   Now what do I do?
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.680]   When should I spend it all?
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.520]   - Perfect.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.720]   You just teed up what I wanna talk about,
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.040]   which is like implementing this.
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.160]   I now have a lot of the mindset ideas
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:30.640]   and the frameworks on how to do this.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.200]   And when I left the book thinking, I was like, okay,
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:38.200]   how does someone figure out based on where I'm at today,
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.440]   should I be spending more money?
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.920]   Should I be spending less money?
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.160]   How do you answer that question?
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.000]   - It's a tricky question.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.480]   The first thing I ask is the experience that we all want
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.680]   for us is survival.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.120]   So have we survived for our survival number?
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.840]   So I introduced that concept of like, okay,
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.080]   when you no longer can work or et cetera,
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.400]   do you have enough to have the very basics
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.600]   like food, shelter, clothing?
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.880]   And depending on where you are, that's a different number.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.200]   And then after that, like, how do I spend my money?
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.680]   I try and use health as a forcing function,
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.120]   because it is, on the allocation of spending money.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.720]   I look at my parents, my ancestors,
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.800]   we literally had to kidnap my mom
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.840]   to take her to Scotland for her 80th birthday.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:19.680]   It was an ordeal.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.520]   She had the time of her life,
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.480]   but it was like an ordeal to get it.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.200]   We're like, you're coming, whatever,
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.160]   we're getting you out here.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.320]   But what I realized is that my mom
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:31.040]   does not consume much money at all.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.100]   My grandmother did not consume much money at all.
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.000]   My dad did not want to leave his apartment
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:37.840]   when it come at all.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.080]   Now I always say I'm gonna be different
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:40.280]   'cause I'm gonna be in shape or whatever,
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.600]   but the reality is I'm going to be some version of that.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:47.200]   So I'm like, the idea that I'm going to be
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:52.200]   having this Chronicle Cruise life at 77 to 86 is bullshit.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.740]   I'm not gonna be consuming that much.
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.680]   So I'm thinking, if I'm going to have parties,
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.200]   if I'm going to travel,
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.180]   if I'm going to hike these mountains,
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.720]   if I'm going to do these activities,
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.240]   if I'm going to even just go on a walk in the park
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:10.240]   and do a seven mile hike with my kids, a free activity,
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:14.520]   those activities belong here and I need to consume them now.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.360]   So even the free ones have to get bucketed.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.740]   And I always think about that aspect of it
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.960]   because I'm like, how do I allocate my fund
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.560]   once my survival is covered?
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:28.840]   There is no perfect answer, but I do look at that,
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:33.840]   hey, my net worth should be peaking between 45 and 55.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:38.080]   And if I'm in the peak, how does this curve go down?
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.800]   And I try and match it for me.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:43.160]   I've been talking to these doctors like Peter Tia
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:45.480]   and Chris Renna, et cetera.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.840]   And what I really want to know is
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:48.760]   what is the pace of my body deteriorating?
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.440]   What is the pace of my mind deteriorating?
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:53.040]   What is the pace of my lung capacity deteriorating?
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:58.040]   And then I know like, oh, if you are this type of activity,
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:03.560]   your enjoyment of activity goes down linearly
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.880]   with this decline and your ability to do it
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:09.000]   completely cuts off once you reach this level.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.800]   And I think it's like two watt hours per kilogram
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.800]   to climb a flight of stairs or something like that.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.000]   There's like formulas out there.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.080]   I'm like, oh, okay.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.800]   So if you need to run and play soccer
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.760]   and jump and play basketball,
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.840]   you need X watt hours per kilogram of energy, muscle,
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:22.880]   and what that converts to.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.640]   And then we know how many watt hours per kilogram
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.480]   people have as they age.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.160]   And I was like, wow, this would be great
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.520]   to figure out where my consumption is.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.300]   And that's what I was trying to build with this model.
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.760]   Like you're an optimizer and build this model.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.980]   And I realized this is impossible.
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:39.680]   There's so many goddamn inputs.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:44.680]   So really it comes down to a mental model of each activity.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:48.960]   Like, okay, here's the straight line to the grave
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.600]   of spending down all my money.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.800]   Here's kind of the curve I think it should be
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.600]   to get to my survival number, et cetera.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:59.300]   And then when I look at my time bucketing,
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.540]   wait a minute, I said I was gonna be spending less,
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:04.360]   but I like riding on trains and that doesn't take any energy
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.380]   but it costs a lot of money.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:07.760]   So let's change the spending and the curve like this.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:10.540]   So it's not gonna necessarily always be this perfect
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.880]   log normal curve down to zero from your peak.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.880]   It could be no, but there's trains
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.760]   and I wanna ride trains and then down.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.620]   Each person is different.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.060]   It really takes a lot of thinking,
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.600]   a lot of off autopilot
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.480]   'cause you have to know what you want.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.920]   You have to have an idea at least 70% of what you want.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.060]   A lot of it's gonna be discovery, potluck.
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:31.580]   And then you have to think about the wins.
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.920]   You have to be honest with yourself.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.860]   A lot of people are like, oh, I'm in better shape
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.700]   than I was when I was 30 and 50.
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.900]   I'm like, well, that means you were just
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.340]   really out of shape at 30.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.900]   And so that's it.
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:44.080]   And I know that's not like the answer people wanna hear.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.020]   They're like, I want the spreadsheet and the formula
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.740]   and the detailed thing and I wanna be told.
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:51.980]   I present like kind of the macro top line.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.960]   Your net fulfillment is an operation
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.220]   of your wealth, health and time.
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:57.440]   And I leave it to the crowd to go and be like,
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.280]   I built this kick-ass spreadsheet.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.860]   - So let me throw out my version,
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.140]   which is not yet a spreadsheet,
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:04.580]   but you had this formula where you're like, okay,
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:08.100]   your survival threshold is how much it's gonna cost you
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:11.500]   to live one year times the number of years left to live
[00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.300]   and then deduct 70% 'cause that money will grow
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.040]   and you can withdraw from it.
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.700]   So what I'm doing in my head is,
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.340]   okay, assuming you can make money,
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.940]   at some point you'll stop being able to make money
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:23.700]   and then you'll live for some number of years.
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:26.340]   Let's call that number 20.
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.000]   Okay, so you can live for 20 years.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.880]   How much does it cost you to live in one year?
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:33.940]   I think everyone always estimates the highest amount
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.020]   it could ever cost you.
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.780]   And I'm gonna use your standpoint of like,
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.740]   actually estimate low 'cause many people end up saving more
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.360]   than they think and spending less.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.700]   So it doesn't make sense to go to the extremes.
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:47.100]   So let's say for the sake of math,
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:50.900]   you need $50,000 to live in your old age
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:55.900]   for 20 years times 0.7, that's $700,000,
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.500]   which might seem like a lot,
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.580]   but if you have your whole life to save that $700,000
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.240]   and let it grow and compound,
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.540]   I guess that would be a number
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:06.060]   that once you've saved an amount of money
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:10.060]   that by the time you're, let's call it 65,
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:13.180]   you will have that, you could stop saving effectively.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.780]   I didn't even include social security
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:15.780]   and all these other things.
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.740]   - It's not necessarily you can stop saving for survival.
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:22.060]   Now it's maybe you wanna go on some big expensive trip
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:23.580]   when you're 75.
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:25.700]   Now we can start talking about our enjoyment,
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.820]   the things that fulfill us besides surviving.
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.420]   We can solve for thriving.
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:33.940]   - So you could decide I want to equally distribute
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:36.100]   my enjoyment of life over my life.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.640]   And then your goal is as long as you're putting aside enough
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.780]   to get to 700,000 by the time you're 65,
[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:45.140]   well then every year you could just spend
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:48.540]   all the excess on enjoyment and you'd be fine.
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:51.560]   What that wouldn't let you do is maybe you wanna take
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:54.780]   this crazy giant adventure when you're 45 or 50,
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.420]   you might wanna save for that.
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:59.580]   But it made me think that if you've already saved enough
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:03.940]   that 30, 40 years from now it'll grow to be enough
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:07.340]   to survive in retirement, all of the excess
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.940]   you can maybe even think of as a separate bucket
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.060]   for enjoying life.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:12.380]   How do I wanna distribute it?
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:17.180]   And separate your savings that's for living in retirement,
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:20.300]   in a home, being able to feed yourself, there's that money.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.820]   And I think maybe one thing that I've never really thought
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.740]   of until I'm speaking it out loud right now
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.940]   is in my mind I'm saving one amount of money
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.780]   that's savings for the future.
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:30.780]   But if we separated it out and said,
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:32.560]   okay well here's how much you've saved
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.100]   and let's set that aside 'cause you need it to live.
[00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.220]   Now the rest is all money you can spend however you want.
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:40.820]   And you need to make sure that balance also goes to zero.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.300]   Like the other one's probably gonna go to zero
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.500]   'cause you're gonna spend it in retirement.
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.300]   But that one needs to go to zero.
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.740]   - Correct, and that's what I do in the book.
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.980]   If separating it out makes it easier for you
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.900]   to figure out what experiences do I bring forward
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:54.540]   or which money do I bring forward and spend now
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:56.980]   and what do I push back in terms of just the fun bucket.
[00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:57.820]   My life is covered.
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.580]   Let's just say you had the best pension ever.
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:02.460]   Now it's just like, wee, where do I spend the money?
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.420]   So like you've covered your pension
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:05.580]   that covers your survival.
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:07.140]   Now it's like what fulfills you
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:10.620]   and when's the best time to consume those experiences
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:11.900]   that fulfill you.
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:15.140]   - And it's probably not when you're retired.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:18.600]   - For 99.999, many nines of people,
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.300]   it's absolutely not.
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:21.260]   - Yeah.
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.900]   - And particularly for Americans
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:26.020]   because we don't have the health for the activity.
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:27.100]   If I went to the Japanese,
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:30.860]   I would say the curves are distinctly different in Japan
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.940]   than they are in America.
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:33.780]   Because when you go to Japan,
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:35.380]   you'll see 80s and 90s year old shopping,
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:36.900]   hanging out, cleaning, doing whatever,
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:38.540]   like having this very active life.
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:39.380]   - Hiking.
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.340]   - Hiking, doing whatever, all kinds of consumption.
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:42.780]   They're like, yeah, well, I'm gonna travel.
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:43.780]   I'm gonna go to Australia.
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.220]   And they'll be like, whoa, wait, what?
[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:47.460]   You're 85 traveling by yourself going to Australia?
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:50.980]   They can actually consume it for most American, no shot.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:51.800]   I've seen it.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.580]   So many people die on cruise ships,
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:57.140]   getting out and trying to go swimming on the warm water,
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.660]   having heart attacks and stuff like that.
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:01.100]   It's amazing when you watch it in real life.
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:02.500]   Like if you just observe it.
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.140]   I'm not saying I was out there with a lab coat,
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.220]   watching people, et cetera,
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:10.220]   but I've seen so many senior geared entertainment activities
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:13.620]   where it's really not that active.
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.120]   - I love this idea of creating a bucket that is your pension
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.020]   and then the rest you decide how you spend over your life.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.680]   And if that number is not decreasing,
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.780]   it sounds like by the time you're 55,
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.280]   non pension side of it,
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.100]   you're probably doing something wrong
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.140]   or you figured out how to live much longer
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:30.980]   than I'm aware is possible.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:34.780]   - You either have kind of like a abnormal time bucket
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.180]   where there's some sort of activity in the future
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.060]   that costs a lot of money and that can happen.
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:42.100]   You can be like, I really love super yacht cruises
[01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.080]   and this is what I'm saving for.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.520]   And that's really gonna fulfill me the most.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.580]   I don't really care about anything.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:49.180]   I really want to just play chess
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.920]   because my mental acuity is really stronger now
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.760]   and you're gonna be better at chess now
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.600]   and I want to win tournaments
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.880]   and I just want to play chess tournaments.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.680]   And then I want to go on yacht trips later.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.520]   And so you can be like, okay,
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.000]   maybe you're not consuming the most money now,
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   but by and large, the rule is it's now or it's a mistake.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.460]   You're completely fucking it up.
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:07.760]   You're doing life wrong.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.420]   - And it's not just that it's now,
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.840]   it's that now benefits you.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.440]   I want to recap what we talked about earlier.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.160]   It's like doing it now will also benefit you later.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.440]   - Yeah, it benefits your future self
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.600]   'cause your future self reaps the memory dividends.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.760]   Things you did in high school,
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.300]   the things you did in college,
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.580]   the trips you had, the honeymoon you had,
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.680]   the adventure you took,
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.160]   the business you started and failed,
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.480]   the business you started and succeeded.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.980]   Like all those things right now,
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.960]   you are reaping the dividends right now.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:35.880]   And as I'm talking,
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.280]   there's probably people in the audience,
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.560]   oh yeah, I remember that, remember that.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.480]   They're like filled, right?
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.000]   They were getting the same endorphins, et cetera,
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.720]   a piece of that fulfillment as actually doing the activity.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.800]   My favorite thing on this is the Coke Pepsi experiment.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.800]   Do you know about this one?
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.680]   That Pepsi tends to win in a blind taste test,
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.340]   but people, you know, Coke destroys them.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.640]   And it's because when you consume a Coke,
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.280]   you consume not only the Coke,
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.800]   but all the memories and the advertising
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.920]   associated with it,
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.160]   'cause it was more advertised.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.360]   And they've done this with fMRI.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:08.820]   You literally consume the experiences
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.780]   when you have a Coke, your prior experiences.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.400]   You literally are getting memory dividends
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.960]   from the commercial and the advertising
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.140]   and the feel good and have a Coke and a smile
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.160]   and all that stuff.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.280]   The years and years of that in your brain
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.200]   is unlocked when you consume a Coke
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.640]   and you know it's a Coke.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.800]   Same thing happens with every activity you have.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.780]   It's like you access and partially relive
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:30.560]   every single experience that you have when you recall it.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.960]   And so I always say maximize positive life experiences.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.440]   - One of your memory dividend enhancements
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.140]   was like reunions with the people
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.860]   you enjoyed the memories with.
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.760]   And I went on this crazy trip to Australia once
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.000]   where we basically had a bunch of money
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.960]   that we had to spend in seven days.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.820]   And so it was just kind of a wild, fun time.
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.800]   And every time I hang out with my friend
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.920]   who we went on this trip with,
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.120]   it's not 100% whether we're there, but it's not zero.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.480]   I feel like we have a society
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.480]   where there were lots of family reunions
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.160]   because families are way more distributed.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.080]   That kind of goes down.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.800]   And my wife and I have been talking about
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:04.920]   whether we have like, I don't know what you call this.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.400]   Like we have a second wedding
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.680]   where you just invite all of your best friends.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.160]   It's like what you did for your birthday.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.620]   Invite all the people you care about
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.280]   on some regular cadence,
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.880]   get to really relive those memories
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.360]   and get all this value.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.320]   And you don't even have to do the things again.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.160]   It's not a cultural thing to have friends reunions,
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.340]   but I think we should.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:21.480]   - I was just joking recently.
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.880]   Like these dates on the calendars,
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.000]   these events are just excuses for us to throw parties
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.420]   and see each other.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.880]   And somebody also just said to me,
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.240]   work is something we do.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.280]   So we have an excuse to hang out with each other.
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.320]   I thought that was pretty powerful.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.720]   And that's true to a certain extent.
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.600]   That's the people that, well, I love my job.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.200]   Well, you really love the people.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.720]   - I think that's a lot why people I know
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.160]   in the last few years being home and not seeing them,
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.360]   they're like, I hate my job.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.240]   It's like, well, maybe you don't hate your job.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.560]   Maybe it's just the thing that you thought you loved
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.400]   was your job.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.240]   And you actually just love the people
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.440]   you're around all the time.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.440]   And if you're not around them,
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.880]   or you're just only seeing them on a screen or something,
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.560]   and you don't have that social stuff, it feels different.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.920]   - I encourage people to deconstruct
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.560]   what is it about the job you love
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.000]   and has the job replaced other muscles?
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.200]   Have you atrophied your social muscle
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.480]   to go meet people and hang out and have dinner
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.000]   and go out to lunch with people
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.360]   because work is the only place that you did these things.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.240]   And so the thing you loved was,
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.680]   oh, wow, I let work consume everything.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.120]   Like I don't take vacations.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.320]   I don't do walks in parks.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.920]   I'm not really to the extent that I would like to do.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.320]   And I've let work take it all over.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.960]   It's how I met my spouse or my significant other.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.600]   It's where I go figure out to go eat.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.000]   It's where most of my dinner is going out on a town
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.480]   or business dinners or whatever.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.600]   Where I go to lunch is usually close to work, et cetera.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:38.160]   And those things are enjoyable, but it's not the work.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.560]   It's, I like going to lunch with people.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.600]   I like camaraderie.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.960]   I like seeing these people.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.320]   I like going to fancy dinners and stuff like that.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.680]   When people retire or quit these jobs, sit in remote,
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.080]   they're like, fuck, I don't know what to do with myself.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.040]   And I'm like, it's because you've atrophied
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:58.160]   all these other muscles and you put all your time
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.800]   into habituating yourself and to being very good
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.760]   at this thing and this thing has been your whole life,
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.600]   your whole world.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.320]   But it doesn't mean that's the optimal place
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.960]   for you to build social relationships,
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.800]   to find a mate, to pick dinner spots, to pick lunch spots.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.400]   It just became the default autopilot thing to do.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.240]   - I've learned so much this past year
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.320]   from the classes I've taken on Masterclass
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.120]   and I am excited to partner with them for this episode.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.300]   With Masterclass, you can learn from the world's best minds
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.400]   anytime, anywhere and at your own pace.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.760]   You can learn songwriting from John Legend,
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.520]   improve your cooking skills from Gordon Ramsey
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.020]   or learn business strategy from Bob Iger,
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.680]   which is especially interesting now
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.000]   that he's back in as CEO at Disney.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.240]   With over 100 classes from a range
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.160]   of world-class instructors,
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.720]   that thing you've always wanted to do
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.520]   is closer than you think.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.480]   One new class I'm really excited about
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.360]   is intentional eating with award-winning journalist
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.360]   Michael Pollan, who wrote "The Omnivore's Dilemma."
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.900]   Instead of being about restrictions or diets,
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.000]   it'll teach you how to eat more ethically,
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.360]   healthfully and sustainably.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.040]   And with every class I've taken,
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:07.140]   I'm blown away by the depth of knowledge
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:10.380]   the instructors have and the quality of the experience.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.980]   And a Masterclass membership makes such a good gift
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:14.740]   for someone this holiday season.
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:17.900]   I know because I gifted it to my dad last year.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.900]   I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:24.160]   This holiday, give one annual membership and get one free.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.500]   Go to allthehacks.com/masterclass today.
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:31.260]   That's allthehacks.com/masterclass.
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.220]   Terms apply.
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:36.340]   Do you all remember episode 122,
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.660]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.820]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.820]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.760]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.200]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:53.060]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:55.700]   from Anyday, I am a total convert
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.780]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.100]   for this episode.
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:02.140]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:05.420]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:08.780]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:12.780]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.380]   The cookware is 100% plastic free
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:18.340]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:21.500]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.700]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.340]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:29.540]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.820]   so you should definitely check that out.

[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:08.300]   I've spent a bunch of time talking to people
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.980]   in the financial independence movement,
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.880]   people who are, let's save all the money we can,
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.900]   let's spend nothing so that we can be financially free.
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:17.640]   Some want to retire early, some just want independence.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.980]   What's your take on FIRE?
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:20.820]   I have a couple of takes.
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:21.640]   The things I like about it
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.080]   and the things I absolutely hate.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:26.140]   The thing I like about it is the FIRE movement
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:29.500]   forces you to be aware of the concept of enough.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.540]   It forces you to get on autopilot,
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.340]   what things are important to me,
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:36.060]   what am I consuming because I really enjoy it
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.700]   and fulfills me, and what am I consuming just to consume it?
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:40.300]   Like advertising and I'm on some sort
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.960]   of consumption autopilot.
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.060]   It really gets them to think about their lives
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:46.900]   in their totality, what the things
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:48.060]   that they really wanna be doing.
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:49.900]   Like I really wanna do this for the rest of my life.
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:50.940]   I really wanna do this for my life.
[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:54.600]   And they use FIRE as a tool to get that.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:55.740]   Things I hate about FIRE.
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:59.020]   One is they all follow this model of,
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:08:59.860]   I'm gonna work, work, work,
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:01.420]   I'm gonna save up this money
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.780]   and I'm going to live off the interest.
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:06.220]   And I'm like, what about the fucking principle?
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.780]   You gotta spend down the principle.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:12.020]   It's all about not giving your life away to money
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.140]   but having an enjoyable life.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.140]   But like you're giving your life away to money
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:16.540]   that you're never gonna spend down.
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:18.180]   So they need to readjust their formulas
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.340]   to include spending down the principle, okay?
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:23.940]   Two, at the extreme, these guys are doing
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:27.500]   a version of autopilot and making a fatal error
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.140]   of not paying attention to time bucketing
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:32.100]   and the power of memory dividends.
[01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.100]   They're basically doing a version of,
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:37.880]   I'm going to go to jail for seven years or 10 years
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.900]   in order to be free and have a great life from 40 on
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:43.340]   or whatever their retirement age is.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:44.580]   Going back to my original statement,
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:45.820]   there's no amount of money you can pay me
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:47.460]   to do five years in Sing Sing.
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.020]   Well, these guys are doing 10, 12 year stints in Sing Sing.
[01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.980]   And there are certain activities,
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.140]   certain expenditures that you should be having
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:59.140]   that only fit in that 30 to 45 bucket.
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:02.660]   They're giving that up unconsciously
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:05.180]   for some future Shangri-La.
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.620]   And then they get to the future Shangri-La
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:08.080]   and I'm not saying it's not great,
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:12.180]   but like, fuck, I really regret not doing X, Y, and Z.
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:15.020]   Or I should have done this when grandmother was alive.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.980]   Or I should have done this when my kids were young
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.260]   and we should have went to Disney World
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:21.400]   instead of saving money to go on an extra trip now.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:25.320]   At the extreme, fire is another version of autopilot.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:29.220]   It's not really correctly solving for net fulfillment
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:31.220]   and there needs to be some adjustments.
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:33.600]   - Somewhere in the middle between the fire autopilot
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.480]   and the standard American autopilot is probably optimal.
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.840]   - Yeah, it's definitely great.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.540]   It's just like, okay, these are people who like,
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.200]   they got the spreadsheet, they're in touch
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.040]   with what they want, they know the concept enough.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:43.880]   And I'm like, guys,
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.280]   why are you not spending down a principle?
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.240]   This is craziness.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.480]   You're trying to get the most out of life,
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.760]   but you exchange 10 years of your life
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.320]   for something that you're never gonna consume.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.480]   You're just gonna consume the drips and drabs of it.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.920]   - Is that like the 2% rule?
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.900]   I'm making it up, but it's like,
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:02.440]   if you could live off the interest at 4% forever,
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.120]   what would you need to just not spend it all?
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.080]   - What I tell these people is that basically
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.240]   you're overworking.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.960]   You're giving it up an extra two or three years of your life
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.600]   because you're not including spending down the principle.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:15.680]   You're overshooting.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.000]   The main thing is though,
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   that autopilot really leads to future regret
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.200]   with certain experiences,
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.600]   if they're not really conscious
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.320]   about what experiences belong when.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.360]   - You didn't mention one criticism that I have,
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.880]   which is it assumes often,
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.000]   at least with the retire early side,
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.480]   that once you stop working, you don't make money.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:39.160]   And I think most people, I'm sure there are exceptions,
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.160]   but most people can't just do nothing for 50 years,
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.520]   especially when those years are in your 30s and 40s
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.640]   and 50s and 60s.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:52.160]   So I think if you assume you're not gonna work at all,
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.160]   then you need so much money.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.200]   But if you assume maybe you could work some,
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.360]   then it changes the calculus wildly.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.260]   Like you go from needing millions and millions of dollars
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:04.880]   to maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:05.700]   - Yeah.
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:09.040]   The sledgehammer of fire in our culture
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.360]   is probably more needed than not the sledgehammer of fire
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.840]   because we have so many people just needlessly attached
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.720]   to things that don't serve them,
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:19.160]   that they don't even really want.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.360]   But there's plenty of criticism of the fire's autopilot
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.080]   and that sledgehammer and that kind of militant,
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.680]   I'm gonna save for this and whatever.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.640]   There's these assumptions in there that are not true.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.600]   You pointed out that, yeah, you're probably gonna work
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.780]   or have a side hustle or sell your art
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:35.880]   that you're gonna make or whatever.
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:38.560]   There'll be some form of income that you could have
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.440]   or you will have.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.000]   Not everybody, somebody's gonna be like, not me,
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.640]   I'm going backpacking and I'm not making a dime.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:44.680]   Okay, you're that guy.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.640]   There is a version of autopilot and fire
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.120]   and it's dangerous because I'm talking
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.080]   about wasting your life.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.800]   And when you say, I'm gonna grind, not consume,
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.920]   not go anywhere for 10 years,
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:57.160]   I'm like, that's a lot of fucking life.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.000]   - Yeah.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.140]   - Or 15 years to be giving away.
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:02.080]   That's extremely dangerous in the net fulfillment game,
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.660]   in the not waste your life game.
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:07.080]   - I'm much more comfortable with if there was a way
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.520]   to reframe it as like, you need this much money
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.100]   to experiment with financial independence
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:14.560]   for a period of time, which is like,
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.800]   maybe change your job to a job that pays less,
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.080]   that gives you the time you want.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.040]   But that number is so much smaller
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.320]   that you don't need to save it by giving up everything.
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.120]   So I'm gonna challenge anyone in the audience
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.280]   and email me, just Chris at AllTheHacks.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.400]   If anyone wants to try to like build a model
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.960]   or a framework or something to try
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.540]   to create this middle ground, I wanna see it.
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:34.760]   I wanna get in the spreadsheet.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:37.440]   I wanna build the model with you and see if we could do it.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.560]   - You have to take an individualistic approach though.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.320]   The problem was like building a spreadsheet
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.840]   for just the masses is that everyone is different
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.120]   and everybody has different things that fulfill them,
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.080]   which means they're always gonna have different spend curves
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:50.900]   and different needs.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.180]   And you'd be like, yeah, the thing you want,
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.480]   you really need to just bust your ass for two years
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.400]   and get it, right?
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.800]   'Cause there's this step function and cost.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.680]   Like the only thing I want is a trip to Mars
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.920]   and that ticket costs $225,000.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:04.920]   Well, okay, there's no half going to Mars.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.160]   You have to get the $225,000 or whatever the price is.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.240]   I'm making that up.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.120]   But if it's like, I like roller skating
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:13.080]   and I like hanging out with my kids and I like whatever.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.080]   And then there's some middle ground.
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:14.980]   You can still roller skate.
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:15.960]   Let's go roller skating now.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.160]   You don't have to save up all the money
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.600]   to go roller skating 10 years from now.
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.800]   As a matter of fact,
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.360]   daughter's probably not gonna go roller skating
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.200]   with you 10 years from now.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.680]   She's gotta have her own life and her own thing.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.020]   So let's optimize for that thing that fulfills you.
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.340]   You can build a model spreadsheet
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:29.100]   for kind of like the average person,
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.800]   which there's no such thing as the average person,
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.600]   but it's very like, this is me.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.760]   I've built out this spreadsheet.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.880]   And I think the beauty of that spreadsheet
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.480]   that somebody builds out is not the actual formulas
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.680]   that I'll be able to copy and paste to my life,
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.840]   but the methodology of their thinking.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:48.560]   It's the model that is the most powerful thing.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.160]   You want the method of thinking like,
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.360]   how do I think about this problem?
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.920]   What variables do I consider?
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.720]   - I think the thing we might be able to build pretty easily.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.800]   So in the Wealthfront app, there's this idea of an FU number.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.560]   We call it the financial utopia number.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.440]   But the idea is once you have this amount of money,
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.320]   you could stop working.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:08.520]   And the number that I want to build a simple calculator for
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.000]   is kind of like the pension number,
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.360]   where it's like, once you've started saving X,
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:18.360]   you've solved for the money you need to live in retirement.
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.000]   It's not about stopping working.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.640]   It's about starting to realize you now have crossed over
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:27.720]   a threshold of being on track to pay for life in retirement,
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:29.800]   basic needs, that you're now at a point
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.200]   where you can start to allocate your excess.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.880]   You could allocate it now, you could allocate it
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.080]   in the future, but I imagine that for many people,
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.720]   getting to the point that they're like,
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.120]   just maxing out their 401k gets them to that point.
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.200]   Like if you max out your 401k for your whole life,
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.180]   and I haven't done the math,
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:50.180]   but maybe you have solved for retirement basic needs.
[01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:52.600]   And now you're at a point that you can figure out
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.320]   what to do with all of your excess each month.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.200]   Sure, you could save it so you can spend it in your 50s,
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:59.220]   you can spend it in your 30s, you could spend it in your 70s,
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:00.900]   but at least coming up with a framework
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:02.120]   to help people understand.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.800]   Because in the Wealthfront app, we say, okay,
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.840]   this is your financial utopia number, your FU number,
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:09.120]   but it might be $5 million because if you're 30,
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.840]   it's the amount of money you need today to never work again
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:14.080]   and keep spending what you spend today.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.080]   But I don't know if that's helpful.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:18.140]   I think it'd be more helpful to have a number that is,
[01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:21.720]   here is how much money you need to have saved
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:24.780]   to have retirement solved, and now all the excess
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.280]   that you save each month, you could spend.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.660]   That simple thing might be universal.
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:29.940]   Obviously it would need variables
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:31.720]   of how much you need to spend in retirement.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.280]   - I think it helps get the concept across.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:37.240]   I would say that it's not optimal the front load
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.840]   you're saving for retirement and then go,
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.720]   say the rest of the money I make is for goofing off
[01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:42.560]   and allocating it.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.120]   I think getting the concept across
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.480]   and people freeing their mind, I'm like,
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.680]   holy shit, this money is for fun.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.960]   And when do I want to have fun?
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.180]   And I'm going to allocate the fun
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.360]   at the right times in my life.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.200]   It's powerful.
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.880]   What I would say is that you don't work two years
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.900]   for retirement and then start spending spun.
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.440]   You work some for retirement and some goes to fund,
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.120]   some goes to fund, and it gets there at a certain point,
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.600]   particularly because of time bucketing
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.700]   and the fact that certain experiences belong then.
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.400]   And if you take that money,
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.660]   and if you don't have that experience in this time period,
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.700]   you never have that experience.
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:17.320]   And that leads to future regret and less fulfillment.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:20.720]   And so it is not optimal the front load retirement.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.520]   May solve some sort of fear in you,
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.820]   but to get the concept across,
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:25.640]   I think most of your audience is like,
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.400]   they really have retirement covered, right?
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.200]   They really have their survival number covered.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.320]   So if they could separate that out,
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.920]   maybe some of the young people don't,
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.560]   but if you can separate that out and think,
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.320]   okay, I'm putting this into a retirement bucket.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.960]   I'm on track to hit retirement.
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.940]   How do I spend my fund money?
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.480]   And how do I allocate that throughout my life?
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.880]   I think it's better than nothing.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.960]   'Cause it's mainly getting that concept across.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.560]   It's the way of thinking.
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:47.480]   I want it to sink in.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:49.160]   I wrote the book,
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.480]   not as like some sort of economics book
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.360]   or physics book or calculus book.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.240]   The reason why the book has stories in it
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:58.440]   is because you have to get past people's habits and egos.
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.000]   There's a reason why the book starts out with a death,
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.400]   a premature death.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.360]   It's because immediately your ego disappears
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.320]   and you think, yeah, I'm going to die.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.880]   How am I gonna allocate the hours of my life?
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:09.840]   How am I gonna spend the money?
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.160]   Even though my life is longer,
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.520]   and this guy's was two years,
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.460]   we have the same problem.
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:16.700]   And the reason why we go over objections
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.560]   is to get it in a way to get past your ego,
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560]   the habits that you're formed
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.560]   so that you actually execute on these ideas,
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.320]   build on these ideas to have a more fulfilling life.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.720]   You probably heard me say it.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.680]   I'm out here trying to save people's lives.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:32.200]   And a lot of times people are like,
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.640]   the fuck are you talking about Perkins,
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.480]   save people's lives?
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:37.520]   You wrote a goddamn book about optimizing
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.360]   and net fulfillment.
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:41.120]   And I use this example of,
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.000]   listen, when you pull somebody drowning in a pool,
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.760]   they're drowning and you pull them out,
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:47.760]   you give them mouth to mouth
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.720]   and get the water out or whatever.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.840]   And they're like, oh my God, you saved my life.
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.120]   I'm like, guess what?
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.840]   They're still gonna fucking die.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:58.120]   They're just not gonna die that day.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:01.920]   They're still going to die, 100%.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.720]   So what have you given them?
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.280]   You've given them more choices, more time,
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.680]   more experience, more I love yous,
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:10.960]   more going to the opera,
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:12.680]   more hanging out with their grandmother.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.920]   You've given them more of their life,
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.040]   more experience to have,
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.240]   and then they ultimately die.
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.080]   And so with this book,
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.200]   when I get you to optimize for net fulfillment,
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.120]   I'm giving you more choices,
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.520]   more trips with grandma,
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.880]   more going to the opera,
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.160]   more charities, more ski trips.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.120]   It's the same thing.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.920]   It's the same thing in my mind.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:31.760]   I'm just gonna go with that.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.160]   So I'm like a fanatic when it comes to this,
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.920]   because I truly believe that
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.840]   when you optimize your life that much,
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.680]   just the same way you optimize by saving,
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.440]   you get more trips and more life,
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.840]   that I'm saving people's lives.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.800]   - I've started putting some of this into place.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.240]   My wife and I actually had a conversation about money.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:51.440]   My wife was like, oh, we should try to hit this goal.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:52.440]   And then I was like, no, no, no.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.080]   I've been reading this book.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.480]   Why are we even trying to hit a higher goal?
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.720]   What is it even for?
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:57.560]   And now we're like, no,
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.920]   we actually have a new net worth goal and it's down.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.360]   - Yeah, it might be.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.000]   That conversation is a great one to have
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.400]   because she might pull something out
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.240]   because this is the trip I wanna go on.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:08.800]   And it's like this big expensive thing,
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.280]   or I wanna fly around in a G650 or whatever it is.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.120]   You'd be like, okay,
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:17.400]   at least we've attached what we're working for.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:21.760]   A lot of people forget what they're working for.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.680]   If you ask them,
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:26.280]   they'll just regurgitate the autopilot answer.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.520]   To get more money to the thing or whatever,
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.800]   because it's like, no, stop, stop, stop.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.640]   You're going to work and they're gonna give you money.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.800]   What's the money for?
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:34.920]   Why do you need more money?
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:39.200]   What can you not afford that you need to work for
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.760]   in order to consume?
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:43.160]   And then we have a real conversation.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.640]   - She would be the first to admit
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.440]   she was just on this path of accumulate, accumulate.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.320]   She hadn't taken the pause to think about it.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.440]   And then when we did, it clicked
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.280]   and the conversation was totally different.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.240]   I still think we need to figure out
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.680]   what we wanna do with money and savings and spending
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.040]   and when we wanna do it.
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.400]   But I think we've both now been like,
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.200]   we're off the, let's just rack up money.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.760]   Like that is no longer a goal.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:05.600]   So thank you.
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.440]   - I'm gonna hit a point
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.080]   because a lot of people are probably thinking,
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.400]   well, there's nothing I wanna do.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.560]   They're listening to this and they're like,
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:11.840]   I don't wanna do anything else.
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.640]   And the reason why you don't wanna do anything else
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.360]   is because you've been a rat on a wheel.
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.160]   You haven't been exercising those muscles.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.760]   You don't know how to play anymore.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:21.800]   You forgot.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.000]   You do wanna do things.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   They're just buried so deep
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.880]   under all these routines you built to acquiring money.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:29.960]   And those muscles are so atrophied.
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.760]   It's like you haven't gone to the gym for five years
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.080]   and you come in and you try and lift 225 pounds.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:34.920]   It's not happening.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.040]   You need to build up into it.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.440]   You need to start small and be like,
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.440]   okay, let me think about these things I wanna do.
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.560]   Do I really like that?
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:42.640]   Let me just go out and discover
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.600]   because life is discovery.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.600]   You don't necessarily know everything you wanna do.
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.240]   You have to go out and be exposed to it.
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.040]   But you have only been exposed to work
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.120]   and making more money and climbing the career ladder
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.840]   and doing more deals and solving this puzzle
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.840]   that you've been solving, that you've been addicted for.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.440]   And you haven't been working on the, what fulfills me?
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.520]   What trips do I like?
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.800]   What experience do I have?
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.400]   How would I spend money if I had it?
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.760]   You don't even think about those things.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.600]   And so it takes time.
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.760]   Don't be discouraged.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:12.360]   You're not going to like just show up in the gym once
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.680]   and get in shape overnight.
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.120]   You're not gonna just quit your job
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.880]   and know exactly what you wanna do overnight.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:19.760]   You have to build yourself back up.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:22.640]   You have to get back in touch and don't get discouraged.
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:25.040]   If I quit completely doing trading
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.800]   and I think about this all the time,
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.800]   wow, I got a lot of time.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.040]   I don't know what to do.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.160]   And you get this panic, oh, I gotta go back to work.
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.760]   You just got thrown into the water
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:34.880]   and you forgot how to swim.
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.080]   You're like, calm down, float for a little bit.
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.680]   Do a little stroke, you'll get there.
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:40.440]   Then you'll have the more fulfilling life.
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:41.280]   - Awesome.
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.000]   And a couple of random things totally separate
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.680]   that I think maybe tie in, maybe don't.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.920]   - Okay. - Before we wrap.
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.600]   One, I wanna just get your take.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.600]   You're an optimizer, you wrote a book about optimizing.
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:50.800]   Me too.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:53.240]   Talk me through a few things that I just need someone
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:55.240]   like you to tell me why I'm being crazy.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.020]   I think one of the challenges I have with both money
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.600]   and you made a joke about a person
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.760]   that's accumulated millions of miles, that's me.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:04.600]   And one of my challenges with using money, miles,
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.800]   currency, anything, is that I'm aware
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:10.920]   of how much more optimal it could be used.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.640]   I know that if I really find the right trip,
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.560]   500,000 miles will take the whole family around the world.
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.640]   But if I book it today for the thing I want,
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:20.360]   it's a million and I struggle.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.840]   Or we were talking about the holidays this year.
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:25.360]   We're like, we have time off, we don't have plans,
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.360]   but wow, it's four times more expensive
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.140]   to go on any vacation at the end of December
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.320]   than it is in January.
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.660]   We don't have the time off in January,
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:34.380]   so we're not actually gonna do that.
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:36.840]   But in my mind, it's like punt
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.980]   'cause it's an inoptimal use of that money.
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:42.080]   - My main thing for you is you're solving
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:44.640]   for max flyer miles and you're not solving
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.200]   for max fulfillment.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:50.220]   And so what you don't realize is that max fulfillment
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:53.520]   for you costs this much and that's just the cost.
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:56.060]   So there's a time period where it belongs
[01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:58.160]   and this is the optimal time for it to happen
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.360]   and this is the purchase price.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.320]   And you're like, but I can do the trip
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.520]   at a suboptimal time at less fulfillment
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.360]   for 500,000 miles.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.500]   And I'm like, you can do that,
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:10.560]   but realize that you're solving for spending less miles
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.200]   and not solving for max fulfillment.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:14.840]   If you're the type of guy that when you look back
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:16.220]   on your death bed, you'd be like, wow,
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:19.640]   I saved all these goddamn miles as opposed to,
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:22.640]   holy shit, I fucked up my fulfillment in this time period
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.080]   when my kids were this age,
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.680]   when it was time for me to doing this
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.140]   and I misallocated my time,
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.120]   then go ahead and solve for miles.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.440]   - Or money in that case also.
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.200]   - Yeah, money, miles, whatever it is you're solving for.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.440]   You're optimizing for miles.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.160]   And I'm like, listen, fulfillment first, miles second.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.600]   There's gonna be some blend,
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:40.120]   but the maximum fulfillment is what we're solving for.
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.200]   And so sometimes you're gonna have to vaporize the miles
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:44.160]   'cause that's what it costs.
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.920]   And then lo and behold, the airlines know this.
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:51.520]   They know that like in Western culture, these holidays,
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.380]   this is when people want to fulfill their lives, et cetera.
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:56.560]   So we get to charge more for fulfillment.
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.200]   And when kids are like in finals, et cetera,
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.960]   there's no family trips, et cetera.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.040]   So we can charge less.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:02.880]   They know this.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.040]   This is the cost of fulfillment.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.280]   Like everything costs.
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:08.040]   And you're like, no, no, no, no.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.440]   I wanna just have the lowest cost.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.160]   And I'm like, no, I wanna have the highest fulfillment.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.880]   So if you get back on,
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:16.600]   I'm solving for max fulfillment with my family,
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.120]   I think you'll become less detached
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:21.800]   on the value of the conversion of the points
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:22.960]   for certain activities.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.760]   - Maybe the answer is sit down and say, look,
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.880]   we have two choices.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.280]   And in the next X hours, days, whatever,
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.480]   we're gonna pick one.
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:32.360]   Either we actually do commit
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.520]   and we go book the trip in January when it's better.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.680]   I'm not saying punt years.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:38.040]   I'm saying either you say, look,
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.560]   we're just gonna find a way to make it work
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.640]   at a lower price,
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.480]   or we're just gonna pay the price to go when it's convenient,
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.160]   but not let ourselves escape the decision.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.480]   I think that's the thing.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.720]   It's like you either pay up
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:51.280]   because you want the fulfillment
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.600]   or you adjust life to make it work at a better price,
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:57.920]   as long as you don't not take the experience.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.600]   - To me, it's like trip here, trip here, trip here,
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:01.680]   trip here, trip here.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:03.040]   What is the most fulfilling?
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.240]   Is it worth it?
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.760]   What is gives me the net fulfillment?
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.920]   It might be not the January.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.800]   It might be trip here and another trip and two trips.
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:12.400]   And since they're in the same time bucket,
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.720]   that's actually more fulfillment.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:15.240]   Two different environments, et cetera.
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.360]   There's gonna be a lot of variables.
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:17.720]   Like we'd get off the chalkboard,
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.000]   I'd go over with you and I'm like,
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.240]   all right, you're really gonna take two trips?
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.440]   Yeah, I'm really gonna take two trips.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.320]   And that's a million miles for two trips,
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.080]   but it's not over Christmas.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.920]   How do you feel about the fulfillment score?
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.440]   Let's put a fulfillment score on each trip.
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.840]   Okay, it seems to add up more than the trip over Christmas.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.040]   Are we sure about that?
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.040]   Yeah, we're sure about that.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:34.080]   We're not sure about that.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.960]   We'd go through this whole exercise with your wife
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:39.720]   and talk about it and then we'd come to a decision.
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:42.120]   And then we would make the right decision
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:46.200]   knowing that we solve for net fulfillment, not miles.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.720]   The miles was an input.
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.280]   It's like wealth, health and time, right?
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.440]   So miles is kind of in the wealth bucket.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.000]   That was an input to solve for net fulfillment.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.280]   And we slid it back and forth in time.
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:57.520]   Like, all right, two trips.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.480]   Two trips, not Christmas actually is better.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.800]   We'll hang out at home and play board games
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.200]   and then go on two trips.
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.280]   I look forward to sending you a note saying,
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.120]   "We took the trip."
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.960]   Or the two trips or the three trips.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:09.800]   Or the two trips, right?
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:10.880]   Whatever it works out to be.
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.960]   Or a trip and a half or a trip plus an upgrade.
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.760]   These are the things that I don't have the right answer
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.040]   because the inputs matter the most,
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:18.360]   but like the mental model is there.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:19.720]   Like you're thinking about it.
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:21.600]   The other thing I wanna touch on is health.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.640]   So it seems like one of the biggest opportunities
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:27.520]   to unlock a lot of this equation
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.280]   is to be healthier, live longer.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.600]   You talked about how in Japan people are just,
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.160]   as a society, that.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.280]   I know you've spent a lot of time
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.520]   with some of these great doctors.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.040]   Are there things that someone listening
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.920]   who doesn't get a chance to talk to Peter or Tia
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.600]   or something on a regular basis,
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:43.720]   is there stuff you've learned,
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:46.960]   whether it's tests to consider doing now
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.760]   or ways you've changed your diet or your health
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:53.960]   that people could do to improve or extend the time
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.440]   that they can do more active things
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.880]   and I guess live longer or?
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.480]   - I think I pay a lot for the last 15%.
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.800]   Like 85%, even the fanciest doctors,
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.080]   it's all low-hanging fruit.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.560]   And the lowest hanging fruit is like,
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.720]   hey, do an activity that makes you sweat
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:11.200]   for four hours a week, maintain your weight,
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.160]   try not to consume added sugar,
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.320]   reduce all your sugars in your sugar intake,
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.600]   no alcohol, don't smoke.
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.040]   Like the super low-hanging fruit
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:22.160]   about not being overweight, staying in shape,
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.280]   not consuming added sugars,
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.400]   like sugar is the worst, and exercise,
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.680]   even if it's hiking or walking three miles a day
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:32.640]   or three miles four times a week or something like that,
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.720]   that's amazing low-hanging fruit
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:38.480]   to make your current experiences better
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.040]   and your future experiences better.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:43.360]   Because activity by health is the fulfillment
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.520]   and if your health is shitty,
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.920]   either you don't get to do the activity
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.440]   or the activity is not as enjoyable.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:49.760]   I used to walk like seven to 12 miles around Paris
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.080]   when I was there, just with a backpack on.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.000]   Now I can maybe do six or five before I'm like,
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.760]   my knees kinda hurt, I don't like it anymore.
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.280]   So I got more of Paris on a trip
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:02.720]   for the same dollar than I do now.
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.800]   And the more in shape I am, the less overweight I am,
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.000]   the less weight I'm carrying
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.320]   and force I'm hitting into my knees,
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.200]   the more enjoyable every single activity is.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.640]   I would argue and say to people like,
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:15.480]   that low-hanging fruit has such a huge yield
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:17.220]   on your fulfillment.
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:19.640]   Whether you're gonna be able to enjoy playing
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.960]   with your kids or relatives or be around
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:24.560]   or even enjoy getting on a plane, et cetera,
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.080]   later on in life is highly correlated
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:30.160]   and highly dependent on the state of your health right now.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.240]   I can't emphasize it enough.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.080]   It's not a health book.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.920]   I'm like, listen, there are tons of book,
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:37.840]   podcasts, motivational speakers, et cetera,
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.080]   on like how to be healthy.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:43.180]   And I just say, this vertical is uber important.
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:44.780]   Make sure you're addressed it.
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:48.500]   Try and do activities that fulfill you
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.080]   irrespective of the health benefits.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.600]   And one of the ones I found is hiking.
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.720]   Like going hiking with a friend,
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:55.240]   I get a great experience talking with them,
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:58.400]   seeing nature, discovering what's around me.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.240]   And it's also has these health benefits,
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:03.600]   cardio benefits, strength, legs, et cetera,
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.280]   that make future experiences better.
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.640]   So I get a double whammy.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:07.480]   - Yeah.
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:10.080]   - Not overeating, not doing X, Y, and Z.
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:12.840]   Try and develop the habits that lead you to the goal
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.280]   'cause your motivation goes up and down.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.200]   So develop these habits.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.640]   Get rid of the snacks, make them move far away.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:19.800]   Don't even buy them.
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:20.840]   Then you can't get to them.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.000]   - You said, if you're looking at a cookie,
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.560]   just be like, is this cookie worth an hour
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:25.640]   on the treadmill?
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:26.480]   - That's the way I do it.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:28.920]   I convert all these things into like time.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.640]   So resources that I'm fighting for,
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.640]   which I think at the end of the day,
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.640]   everybody's fighting for.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:33.560]   They want free time.
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.800]   They want time to do what they want.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.280]   They want more time on the planet.
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.360]   And so if I'm trying to maintain my health
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.680]   and my weight is very important to my future enjoyment,
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:41.520]   my knees, et cetera,
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:44.920]   like is that cookie worth an hour on the treadmill?
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:48.000]   Sometimes a cookie is actually worth an hour on a treadmill.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.720]   If it's a nice, good chocolate chip cookie,
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.640]   I will go on the treadmill for these cookies.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.440]   And sometimes it's, nope.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.320]   - What if I push you since you said you'd answer anything,
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:59.000]   like to peel back some of that 15%
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.400]   that you've learned that I might not know?
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.320]   - I think diagnostics is the key.
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:06.320]   Many diseases, ailments, and their progression
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.360]   are thwarted if you find them earlier enough.
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:10.080]   Some of the cancers that are like always fatal,
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:12.680]   if they had a test for it and they found it early,
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.640]   you'd survive.
[01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.440]   Heart diagnostics, MRI diagnostics.
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:16.280]   If somebody once said to me,
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:21.280]   "You should be spending 10% of your income on your health."
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.600]   I was like, that's fucking crazy.
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:24.800]   I have a pretty high income.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.520]   Then I thought about it and I was like,
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.680]   no, that includes like diet,
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:31.200]   whether I buy prepackaged meals or have a chef,
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:34.240]   that includes doctors, diagnosis, et cetera,
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:37.560]   health plans, and I was like, it's actually low.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:38.400]   - Yeah.
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:39.600]   - It's actually low, it's so important.
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:43.800]   And so a lot of the secret sauce of these doctors is,
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.120]   you know, every quarter they come in
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.800]   and they draw like 32, 36 vials of blood.
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.880]   This is your mineral absorption, this is so-and-so,
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:52.320]   this is what your thyroid is doing, and this is whatever,
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.720]   and here's all the metrics and you're kind of out over here.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:57.520]   Like you need to do Edware and here's your cholesterol.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.440]   And these things, that preventative,
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:02.640]   ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:03.640]   that is the key.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:04.480]   - Yeah.
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.400]   - And the prescription of like,
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.360]   you need to be doing more cardio, you need to do this,
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:08.800]   or you should be avoiding these foods
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.640]   because they inflame you and inflammation is death.
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:14.440]   So diagnostics, diagnostics.
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.920]   - One of the companies that I partner with on the show
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:18.280]   is called Inside Tracker,
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:22.840]   and they do 43 biomarker paired with genetic testing
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.320]   to give you an analysis of both like,
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.920]   different biomarkers and what that means,
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.960]   what your optimal range is adjusted for your genetics,
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.560]   and like what your inner age is,
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:33.440]   which is like looking at all the biomarkers
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:36.080]   of where you should be, are you like ahead or behind?
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:39.000]   So that's one thing that's a little more accessible.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.080]   I know there's some GRAIL tests for early cancer detection,
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:45.600]   I know there's PRENUVO, which is like the full body MRI.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.640]   So I'll punt on pushing on the 15%,
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:50.360]   and I'm just gonna go find a doctor who I've met,
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:51.760]   and we're gonna go deeper on this.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:54.160]   - Yeah, you do the MRI, you look at your telomeres,
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:57.240]   they're like, oh, you can do a hyperbaric chamber.
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:58.840]   Like one of the things you can do
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.320]   that is out of Israeli studies,
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:03.440]   I'll go into one of the cutting edge,
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.460]   but pain in the ass things, okay?
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:07.160]   That I actually stopped doing.
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.960]   You can go into hyperbaric chamber for two hours,
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.800]   and in theory, it lengthens your telomeres,
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.800]   it makes you younger at the cellular level.
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.640]   - Wow.
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:14.560]   - Which means in theory, you know,
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.400]   you're gonna live longer
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.320]   'cause your organs are not gonna break down at the time,
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.160]   you're gonna break down,
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:19.920]   you're gonna get some extension on your telomeres.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:23.480]   And it has all these other therapeutic supposed properties.
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:28.100]   So I'd have to go drive an hour to the hyperbaric chamber,
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:30.440]   I was gonna run the same experiment that the Israelis did.
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:34.320]   So you have to do X months of hyperbaric chambers,
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.120]   whatever it is, it's a lot.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:40.560]   But the place I had to go to was an hour away.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:43.100]   You go dive down, you dive to pressure,
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:44.760]   so it takes a while to get to pressure,
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.240]   then you stay at pressure for an hour
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.400]   or whatever the timeframe is,
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.720]   and then you have to come out.
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.840]   And then I gotta drive an hour back.
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:55.280]   And I was like, okay, I'm going to get X benefit
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:56.960]   and live longer this timeframe,
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:59.960]   but I'm wasting three to four hours a day
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:02.960]   traveling to this hyperbaric chamber back and forth.
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:05.840]   And I was just like, nope, not worth it, I'll die earlier.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:06.680]   You know what I mean?
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.400]   I'll die a year earlier or whatever it is.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.680]   Time is too valuable to me right now in this time bucket.
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:12.560]   So that's one, hyperbaric chambers.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:13.440]   - But might not be worth it.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:14.280]   - No, it's not gonna be worth it.
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.160]   I mean, if I had a hyperbaric chamber in my house
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.720]   and I could just do it when I sleep,
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.360]   I'd be like, I would 100% do it.
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.400]   But that commute to the facility
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.560]   was just absolutely crushing me.
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.800]   - Yeah, I feel that way about cold plunge and sauna
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:27.920]   to the extent that it's like,
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.560]   I should just get one and put it outside.
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.540]   - The sauna, there's data on the health benefits.
[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:33.960]   The cold, the studies aren't there.
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:34.800]   There may be benefits
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.160]   and people are raving about the benefits,
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:37.880]   but the research isn't there.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:41.000]   A sauna definitely confers health benefits,
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.080]   longevity, less chance of a heart attack, yada, yada, yada.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:46.640]   The sauna's a hack.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:49.120]   There's all these like other hacks that are out there.
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:49.960]   - That's the show.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:52.800]   So I'm gonna totally hack the sauna.
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.480]   Hyperbaric chamber might not be worth it,
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.520]   but it's out there.
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:59.280]   Full diagnostics, MRIs, those 3D colon scanners
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:01.760]   where they actually scan your whole body.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:04.920]   There's latest and greatest imaging technology, et cetera,
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.000]   where they're gonna scan you and be like,
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.080]   oh, you got too much visceral fat, you got this.
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:10.480]   I remember when I went there and they were like,
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.320]   do you smoke?
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.140]   And I was like, no, he's like, yeah,
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:13.680]   I can tell when I look at your liver.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:14.640]   I can tell what you do.
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:19.280]   They can tell my habits based on looking at my insides.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.120]   - Wow.
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.520]   - And I was like, okay, I like this.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:24.440]   - I just wrote a newsletter about FSAs and HSAs.
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.400]   So one cool hack to compound it
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.600]   is you could put pre-tax money in from your employer
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.880]   and then use that for some of these health things
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.240]   that aren't covered by insurance.
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:38.240]   We've done that for LASIK, for IVF, for blood tests,
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:39.180]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:41.400]   But the last thing I wanna jump on
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.940]   is every time I talk to someone,
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:44.720]   I let them pick a place
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.840]   that they're pretty familiar with in the world
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.960]   and tell people that are headed there
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:50.080]   how to have a great day there,
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.480]   whether it's doing, drinking, dining, anything.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.520]   So pick a place.
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:54.880]   - I'm gonna pick St. Barts.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.400]   So one, get prepared to spend money.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.600]   Not a cheap island.
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:35:59.440]   You can do it cheap.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:02.000]   I'm sure you'll hack away and find the great Airbnb
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.820]   on a discount on a so-and-so,
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:04.960]   or be a room reviewer
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.520]   or something like that gets you down there cheap.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.080]   But let's say you get down there.
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:11.720]   St. Barts is what I think the perfect match
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:15.040]   of beauty and environment and commerce and fun.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.720]   I would recommend either staying on Flamon's Beach,
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:23.000]   Flamon, or Grand Cul-de-Sac, like Bartholomew,
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.240]   or at the Eden Rock.
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.440]   The main thing is the food.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.080]   So you wanna go get yourself a little moke car
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:32.360]   or something that's a convertible when you rent a car,
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.600]   and make sure you drive around the island.
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.320]   It's not that far to drive around the island.
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.920]   You can drive a little bit and check out little areas.
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:41.840]   You wanna go to visit all the beaches.
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:45.460]   I think Governor Beach is probably the best beach
[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:48.000]   in the world, or one of the best beaches in the world.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.640]   But I also enjoy St. Lene Beach, Grand Cul-de-Sac,
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:51.860]   all these places.
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:54.000]   Eating along the beach and just checking the vibe
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.920]   and hanging out is amazing.
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:57.680]   At Shell Beach, there's a restaurant there.
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.080]   You definitely wanna have lunch there.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.840]   There's Le Tamarin, which is like kinda in this garden.
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.640]   At night, you definitely wanna eat there.
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:06.040]   I would say more for dinner than the lunch.
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:09.320]   There's always gonna be a party somewhere, someplace.
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:12.200]   So in Gustavia, walking around and shopping,
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.840]   there's Nikki Beach, there's the hotels,
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:18.660]   there's kite surfing, there's lounging.
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:20.800]   I would say definitely visit the other hotels
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.760]   and have lunch on the beach.
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.680]   Like, that's good places.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:25.320]   And then go check out the little shops.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:30.320]   A lot of it is vibing and hiking and driving around
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.620]   and just finding little places
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:35.480]   and enjoying the nexus of the French culture.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:37.000]   Because the French are known for being rude,
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.680]   but in St. Barts, it's the nicest of the French.
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:42.240]   It's competitive to come work there and come be there.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:45.100]   So you don't get the rude French, you get the nice French.
[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:48.040]   And you get French cuisine, which is amazing.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:48.880]   It's very good.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.760]   And you get a beautiful island and crystal clear water
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:55.600]   and great beaches and windsurfing and paddle surfing
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:58.600]   and swimming with turtles and things like that.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:37:59.420]   And then you get to drive.
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:01.000]   This island has different climates,
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.980]   where it has a dry side and a wet side.
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:07.740]   And there's all kinds of little experiences you can have
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:09.380]   in the island life way.
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:10.220]   - I'm ready to go.
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:11.440]   (laughing)
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:14.120]   - It's developed enough, but not overdeveloped.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:15.760]   That's what I would say.
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.520]   And that's the beauty of St. Barts.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.160]   And it's clean and it's safe.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:20.000]   - Sounds fantastic.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.640]   - The biggest drawback to St. Barts is it's expensive.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.900]   - Well, there's a time for expensive trips.
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:25.740]   Save for it.
[01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:26.560]   - There is a time.
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:27.480]   - Budget it, spend the money on the trip.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.440]   Don't die with it.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:30.020]   I think that's my takeaway.
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:31.240]   - Yeah, that's your takeaway.
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:33.400]   - Any parting advice or places people should head
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.280]   to check you out where you're working online?
[01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:36.920]   - I use Instagram and Instagram stories
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.560]   as kind of like my own life diary.
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.620]   Going back to that hack,
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.080]   how can you use the memory dividend?
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.040]   I use my stories as my memory dividend.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.520]   They save to my phone and get backed up to Google Cloud.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:48.360]   And then, you know, it will show like on this day
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:50.040]   and I'll have all these little snippets and videos
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:52.440]   of like what happened on this trip or what I did.
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.480]   So I am Bill Perkins on Instagram.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:55.880]   You can follow me.
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:58.800]   Sometimes it's just me and my cat doing nothing exciting,
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.440]   but sometimes it's exciting.
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.360]   If you want hot takes or chaos,
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:05.720]   you can follow me on Twitter @bp22 on Twitter.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.680]   I don't recommend it.
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:07.960]   Sometimes it's markets.
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:09.600]   Sometimes it's finance advice.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.840]   Sometimes it's hot political takes.
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:14.120]   I'm a libertarian, so everybody hates me.
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:16.000]   Left, the right.
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.440]   Sometimes it's just goofing off.
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.520]   If you're in for the chaos,
[01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.520]   it's a format that I like where I can actually interact
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:22.360]   with people enough, talk to them, et cetera.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:25.040]   So I love Twitter too much.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.560]   - But diewithzerobook.com.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.400]   - Oh, diewithzerobook.
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.040]   We were talking all where books are sold everywhere.
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:31.320]   It's on audio book.
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.440]   You can listen to it.
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:33.840]   You can read it everywhere.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:35.000]   diewithzerobook.com.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:35.840]   You can go there.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.720]   It'll list the languages that it's sold.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:38.680]   So it's in Spanish.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:39.640]   It's in Polish.
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.080]   It's in Chinese.
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:42.560]   It's in German.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.480]   It's in Japanese.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:46.880]   And actually the book is most successful in Japan.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.720]   - That's awesome.
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:48.560]   - The book is everywhere.
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:49.600]   That's what I mean to say.
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.440]   - I have the book.
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.600]   I recommend the book.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.000]   It's had a huge impact on me.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.080]   Thanks for writing it.
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.240]   Thank you for being here.
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:56.480]   - I'm glad to be here.
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:57.800]   Thanks for hearing me blather.
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:00.240]   I'm always down to blather again if you want.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.760]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.560]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.320]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:06.840]   If you haven't already left a rating
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:10.240]   and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:11.960]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:13.400]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:15.760]   questions for me, or just want to say hi,
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:20.040]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.120]   That's it for this week.
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:22.320]   I'll see you next week.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:28.180]   (electronic music)
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:30.940]   (birds chirping)
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:33.700]   (birds chirping)
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:36.540]   Thank you for coming.
