[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.360]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.960]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.760]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.560]   and I'm a diehard optimizer who loves doing all the research
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.720]   to help you get the best experience in life
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.320]   without necessarily an expensive price tag.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.420]   Though, here's a thought experiment.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.600]   Imagine that one day you die
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.520]   and you have all this money in your account,
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.600]   but actually you don't.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.620]   How does that feel?
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.680]   You die with zero?
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.500]   Scary, like you did something wrong?
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.160]   That's exactly what today's guest recommends.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.500]   He's Bill Perkins, a longtime hedge fund manager
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.400]   and energy trader who's written a book called "Die With Zero,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.300]   Getting All You Can From Your Money and Your Life."
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.700]   I loved the book.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.860]   You might have a lot of objections to his concept,
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.940]   and I actually did before I read it,
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.900]   but now I'm a huge convert,
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.300]   so we're gonna dive into all of it.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.860]   We're gonna talk about what it actually means
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.020]   to die with zero,
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.220]   why you might wanna stop maximizing net worth
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.980]   and focus on net fulfillment,
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.940]   why you should bank memory dividends,
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.780]   and the ways to do that for maximum ROI,
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.480]   why Bill thinks, contrary to financial advice,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.980]   you should save less money when you're young,
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.200]   why you should think about your life
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.140]   as distinct seasons or time buckets,
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.140]   and how that can help you make the best choices
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.420]   about spending your money, and a lot more.
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.580]   So let's get started right after this.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.500]   Just a quick heads up
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.040]   that there's some language in this episode
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.740]   that you might not want your kids to hear,
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.420]   so maybe throw your headphones in for this one.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.780]   Bill, welcome to the show, and thank you for being here.
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.620]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.440]   It's great to be here.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.900]   Wow, we got a lot to go over, don't we?
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.820]   - I didn't even mention something yet.
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.660]   We got two daughters.
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.380]   There's a lot we could talk about,
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.540]   but your book's all about dying with zero,
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.860]   and that many people save too much money
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.240]   and leave it behind instead of spending it
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.140]   in ways that are more meaningful.
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.460]   You've obviously been very skilled
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.860]   and fortunate at building wealth,
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.960]   so before we jump into all these lessons,
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.580]   I just wanna make sure I understand who this is for,
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.100]   and does it actually apply to people
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.000]   with just a modest income or who haven't built wealth yet?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.980]   - So the book is a bunch of mental models,
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.460]   and it's a counterfactual regret minimization algorithm
[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.540]   that's solving for net fulfillment.
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.580]   A lot of people have algorithms for building wealth.
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.820]   It's solving for building wealth.
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.820]   I'm solving for net fulfillment.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.020]   So what variables are the inputs?
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.140]   Your wealth, your health, and your time.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.280]   Even though people may have more wealth
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.420]   or better health or more time,
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.300]   those variables still you can use formulaically
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.620]   with these mental models to maximize your net fulfillment.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.740]   I wouldn't say this book isn't for unhealthy fat people.
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.220]   They can still get value out of this
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.600]   to maximize their own net fulfillment,
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.620]   and the same thing for people with not that much money.
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.840]   Obviously, a person who's over-saving by millions
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.740]   is formulaically getting more value
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.580]   in terms of the amount of waste that they're wasting
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.680]   by dying with a bunch of money in the bank,
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.220]   but everybody still gets value relative to them
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.380]   to get more out of this one ride called life.
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.620]   - And how do you define net fulfillment?
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.440]   - So I basically say that the sum of your experiences,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.140]   your choices, every moment in your life,
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.300]   when you make a decision, those choices,
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.660]   that is what constitutes your life,
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.340]   and the sum of all those decisions and experiences
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.380]   that you consume will determine whether you've had
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.380]   a full life or fulfilling life or a not-so-fulfilling life
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.460]   relative to the best life you can possibly have.
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.860]   And so I define net fulfillment as your choices,
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.100]   i.e. your experiences, and when I use experiences,
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.340]   I mean it in the broadest sense of the word.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.500]   I don't necessarily mean always taking a trip.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.140]   It could be walking with grandmother.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.780]   It could be donating to a charity.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.140]   It's just every single choice that you make.
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.760]   - And before we jump in, I actually wanna talk
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.500]   about a few common misconceptions,
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.660]   because I feel like some of them came up
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.980]   a little bit late in the book.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.820]   Some of them came up early.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.100]   So I feel like this is important.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.800]   So one I'll share, and I'll ask if there are others,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.940]   is around retirement, and it's that the amount
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.620]   you actually need in retirement is often lower
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.580]   than people think, and it's no surprise
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.380]   that also people increase their assets in retirement.
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.460]   Not all of them, but a good number of them.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.860]   And so something that was helpful for me to realize
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.500]   is if we're all thinking, oh, I should save all this money
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.220]   because I'm gonna need it, because I'm gonna be spending,
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.080]   well, it turns out you probably will spend less
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.540]   based on actual studies, not just your opinion,
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.500]   and you might actually make more in retirement.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.500]   Are there other things that might be common misconceptions
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.560]   people have that understanding might make
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.860]   this whole conversation easier to process
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.700]   in those mindsets?
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.780]   - Yeah, adjacent to what you're saying about spending,
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.520]   the data's kind of overwhelming that people spend less,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.300]   even adjusting for healthcare costs, right?
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.620]   Like people are like, what about healthcare
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.860]   and rising healthcare?
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.740]   It's their bodies, the deterioration,
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.700]   the change in their attitudes, et cetera,
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.780]   their ability to do or enjoy certain activities.
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.960]   Probably all of us have a relative
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.420]   that doesn't like to fly.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.780]   You could take them somewhere, but they're like,
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.700]   I don't wanna sit on a plane for three hours
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.220]   because it hurts my back or my knees
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.540]   or something to that effect.
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.740]   There's probably people my age or younger,
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.460]   40s, used to be athletic and like could not go play
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.260]   a pickup game of flag football right now.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.260]   It wouldn't be as enjoyable.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.180]   They could play it.
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.540]   The misconception that's out there
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.580]   is people think their lives are gonna be
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.620]   like a carnival commercial when they retire,
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.700]   and it cannot be further from the truth.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.940]   And having lived in the Virgin Islands
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.100]   where these cruise lines all park up,
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.340]   like we'd have three, four to seven ships
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.800]   during high season coming in,
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.940]   and the main activity is going into the shops, right?
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.640]   Not these athletic activities to buy something,
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.680]   not for themselves, but for their granddaughters
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.060]   or a relative, et cetera.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.220]   Like they're actually looking for ways
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.740]   to consume the money that they have
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.880]   because they cannot consume it into the experiences
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.400]   that they thought they would.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.480]   - You talk about the declining utility of money with age.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.600]   You have all this money and you say,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.920]   oh, I'm gonna punt on this awesome, amazing trip
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.000]   till I'm retired and I can take time off work.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.400]   And then you're like, I don't know.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.840]   Do I really want to go walk around Japan nonstop?
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.640]   I say this because I took my family,
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.760]   my sister, her husband, my parents to Japan.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.580]   And the degree to which we wanted the kids to go explore
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.500]   was just not the degree to which my parents
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.960]   were willing to go.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.480]   And I don't know if they would have thought
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.440]   that was the case 20 years ago,
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.400]   but there were things they had to miss out on
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.280]   because they're just older and they couldn't keep up.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.660]   - Yeah, I think a lot of people have the model in their head
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.840]   that their ability to convert money into experiences,
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.360]   like your body is static, it will remain the same.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.560]   They kind of divorce this idea that,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.320]   wow, my mental acuity is gonna decline,
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.600]   my lung capacity is gonna decline,
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.480]   my bone density is gonna decline,
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.960]   my muscle mass is gonna decline about 1% a year
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.000]   after age like 35.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.480]   So they don't put all these facts together in that,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.480]   hey, this is obviating either my desire or ability
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.640]   to actually enjoy these activities.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.360]   And so you have a prime example of walking around Japan
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.480]   and Tokyo and so they delayed that trip
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.040]   or that gratification, let's just assume they did,
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.680]   to a point where there really wasn't any gratification.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.240]   Tokyo was less valuable a trip to them.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.880]   - I think there were things where we came home
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.820]   and we were like, oh, you missed this thing.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.880]   They were like, we're okay,
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.160]   because if we had pushed ourselves,
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.200]   it would have been a mess, but we had a great trip.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.440]   Like, I think they had a great trip,
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.440]   but I think that five, 10 years ago,
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.200]   they would have gotten to do 20% more
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.400]   and it would have been a better trip.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.120]   - Correct, you do the best with what you have.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.000]   There's no sense in crying over spilt milk
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.640]   or what they did or didn't do,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.520]   but you can easily look at the scenario
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.880]   and say that was not the optimal time
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.440]   for them to take that trip
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.600]   in the totality of the arc of their lives.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.320]   We don't get to play a sim game and Monte Carlo our lives,
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.260]   be like, well, let me do this trip here and that, whatever.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.640]   But what I try to do with this book
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.080]   is get people to think about
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.280]   how do I optimize for net fulfillment?
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.600]   Where do experiences belong?
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.560]   First, what experiences do I want, right, in my life?
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.000]   And then very importantly,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.020]   where do those experiences belong?
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.960]   Where does the trip to Japan belong?
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.560]   Where does going to the opera belong?
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.040]   Where does hiking this mountain belong?
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.440]   When does the ski trip belong?
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.560]   And that matters, it may matter more than the what.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.720]   - I'll give an example that you basically put on
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.520]   a banger of a 50th birthday party,
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.880]   but you decided to just do it when you were 45
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.040]   because it would be a better experience.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.320]   To me, that was a big moment, I was like,
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.240]   oh, you always think let's do this thing
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.680]   at this milestone in life.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.520]   And you were just like, let's just do it earlier
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.920]   so that I get more out of it.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.000]   - Yeah, there's other smaller examples.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.480]   I was in an island and guys were gonna go wakeboarding.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.640]   You may have heard me say this.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.800]   And I was like, nah, I'm just gonna chill here,
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.920]   relax, et cetera.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.480]   And I have a degenerative cartilage in L3, L4.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.720]   And so my wakeboarding days are limited.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.960]   And if I was gonna go wakeboarding,
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.320]   it's not five years from now.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.600]   And then I was like, okay, when is the next time
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.520]   I'm gonna be on an island where it's warm
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.440]   and there's actually a wakeboard and a wakeboard boat
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.420]   with these friends, et cetera, to go wakeboarding
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.280]   that I physically can do it.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.560]   And I quickly came to the conclusion, never.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.880]   It's now or never.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.760]   This is the last wakeboarding chance
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.120]   I'm probably gonna have for the rest of my life.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.440]   And so I quickly said I can lounge on the beach
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.920]   and relax until my 80s.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.000]   I can't go wakeboarding.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.360]   So now is the time to go wakeboarding.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.880]   So I got on the boat and said, I'm just gonna go do this.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.280]   And that was my last wakeboarding run ever.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.600]   - I have a similar experience, but it wasn't my last.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.100]   I'd always as a kid been a skateboarder, snowboarder,
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.160]   and I'd always wanted to go wakeboarding.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.440]   And for some reason, just the opportunity never arose.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.300]   And finally, I was like, you know what?
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.240]   I'm not getting to the point
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.800]   that I couldn't wakeboard in five years,
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.160]   but I'm getting to the point that
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.840]   if I wanna try to do crazy stuff on a wakeboard,
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.160]   I probably should do it now.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.000]   - Yeah.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.840]   - And then we rented a boat.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.680]   My brother-in-law and I went out
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.800]   and literally the boat was defective
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.520]   and could not go fast enough to do anything.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.760]   So I still need to get that checked off my list
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.560]   because we basically were just trolling around on this boat
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.840]   and we got a refund, which was cool,
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.120]   but I still haven't ticked that one off.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.060]   - And you talk about trying to bucket these things.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.700]   So you have all these ideas in life.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.500]   Your theory is instead of saying, make this big list,
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.540]   you can have a bucket list,
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.540]   but you kind of have this anti-bucket list.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.020]   So why is bucketing things so different than a bucket list?
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.740]   And why is the distinction important?
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.100]   - I like to go backwards to either zero and infinity
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.580]   to try and get a concept across.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.700]   So just before you were born, you're in heaven,
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.340]   the universe, the matrix, creators, whatever your thing is.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.180]   And then God says to you,
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.300]   what experiences do you wanna have
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.860]   on your journey on planet earth?
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.740]   You have 86 years, 79 years, whatever it is,
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.820]   what experiences you wanna have?
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.380]   And you go to the hall of experiences,
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.340]   which is really the hall of choices, right?
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.420]   You're like, I wanna go skateboarding this many times,
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.100]   then I'm gonna go traveling, I wanna have kids,
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.380]   I wanna get a degree, I wanna say I love you
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.500]   this many times, every single thing you can think of.
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.700]   I'm gonna donate charities, I'm gonna whatever.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.140]   You throw it into your infinite bucket of experiences.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.140]   It's not infinite because you're a human, et cetera.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.860]   God goes, great, you can have all those experiences.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.260]   There's only one problem, you have to get the order right.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.940]   And so the guy who puts the like,
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.780]   I wanna go hella skiing and puts it in the 80 to 85 bucket,
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.660]   probably doesn't get to go hella skiing, right?
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.340]   'Cause our decisions are dynamic,
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.780]   our body has a health curve, utility curve,
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.860]   and certain things belong in certain areas.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.820]   So I'd pick like kind of these cartoon exaggerated examples
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.820]   of the why the timing matters, what experiences belong when,
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.740]   but there's tons of them.
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.180]   People have kids and they're like,
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.580]   oh, I'm gonna hang out with my kids
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.060]   when they're 13 or 14 more.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.700]   We're gonna go this, I'm gonna wait for this.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.020]   And your kids don't wanna know you when you're 13 and 14,
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.620]   or they don't wanna do the same activities
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.460]   when you're younger.
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.060]   And people are very acutely aware
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.780]   of how they spend time with their kids
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.020]   and what activities they can do with their kids
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.620]   at certain periods in their life
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.700]   and certain seasons of life.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.260]   But that applies to everyone, in every relationship,
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.100]   even business, your health, spiritual, et cetera.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.260]   And not only are there limits,
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.100]   there's your attitude changes,
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.980]   certain experiences are orthogonal to other experiences.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.380]   My flag football days are done, man.
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.980]   I'm not trying to pull a hamstring, twist a knee, et cetera,
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.780]   because of my body, the recovery time.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.700]   Not that I can't do it,
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.220]   not that it wouldn't be fun while I'm doing it,
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.260]   but it would be less enjoyable afterwards.
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.060]   And it wouldn't be as enjoyable,
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.380]   let's say in my 20s or 30s.
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.220]   Like, hey, let's go play football after work.
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.660]   I would never say that now, right?
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.740]   Never ever, right?
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.300]   So if I had in my bucket of experiences,
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.260]   that had to happen in the 20 to 33 bucket.
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.700]   - We haven't talked about memory dividends,
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.980]   but I think it's interesting,
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.300]   because just because you did that in your 30s
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.540]   doesn't mean you don't get value out of it
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.100]   in your 40s or your 50s or your 60s.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.220]   Just something I'd never seen or heard or thought about,
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.540]   which was you could stack these memories
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.860]   throughout the rest of your life
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.580]   if you actually do them and enjoy them
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.620]   and document them maybe to enhance it.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.860]   - Yeah, the purpose of money is to fulfill your life, right?
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.220]   It's for your consumption.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.700]   You want to use all your resources that you have,
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.820]   your wealth and health and time
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.460]   to get the maximum fulfillment.
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.780]   Let's just go with that.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.620]   I always ask people this, what are you saving for?
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.220]   They'll give me some abstract, like retirement.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.620]   I'm like, no, no, no, no, like house, home, whatever.
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.100]   Okay, I'll give you survival.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.380]   Once your survival is covered, what are you saving for?
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.820]   I want to know exactly in your mind,
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.980]   what are you saving for?
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.980]   Sometimes people will give me like a very definitive answer
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.580]   of like, I want to take this trip.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.700]   I want to go to the opera.
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.060]   I want to be able to take a cruise.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.740]   Every single year of my life from 66 to the grave
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.580]   or whatever it is.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.260]   But a lot of times it's in abstract land.
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.740]   It's just this autopilot answer.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.140]   And when you save money,
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.020]   it's attached to some future consumption or experience.
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.780]   And that experience is going to give you
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.700]   some sort of fulfillment or joy.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.340]   When you consume an experience,
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.140]   you have joy from that experience.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.420]   But also when you recall that experience
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.660]   and revisit that experience, you get joy from it.
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.940]   So it pays a dividend, what I call the memory dividend.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.460]   Anybody who's had a first kiss,
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.460]   hit a game winning home run,
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.580]   they've told that story over and over again.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.980]   And when they tell that story and they recall that story,
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.460]   they get a sense of fulfillment from it.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.740]   That experience, that original experience
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.500]   is paying a dividend and also creating a new memory.
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.460]   As I discuss with you, hey, my backpacking trip
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.700]   or my trip to Asia, et cetera.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.980]   And that adds up to our fulfillment.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.500]   Now you can do it the other way around.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.220]   You can say, well, here is the original experience
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.260]   and here are the dividends
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.220]   and here's the total fulfillment there.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.380]   Or I could put the money in this investment,
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.380]   it will pay dividends, I'll have more money
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.860]   and I'll buy more experiences in the future.
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.180]   And we have to weigh these two things out to optimize it.
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.380]   Is it better to take one ski trip now
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.540]   with my friends and buddies
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.700]   or two ski trips 10 years from now?
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.940]   Because the money is for consumption.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.300]   We're going to use it all.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.820]   So the question is, when is the best time to allocate
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.140]   and which provides the total return on fulfillment?
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.380]   What gets me the highest fulfillment?
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.500]   Depending on who you are, what your age is
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.820]   and the things you like,
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.220]   going through that mental exercise
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.460]   may produce different results.
[00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.060]   Me at 53, a lot of the times,
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.220]   the answer is not two trips 10 years from now.
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.780]   It's the activity now plus the dividends
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.780]   will surely exceed two of the activity later in life.
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.180]   You can just calculate what that return is.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.860]   - Is it as simple as a rule of thumb
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.340]   where it's like for however many years in the future,
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.180]   this thing will be a memory?
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.100]   It is worth, I don't know, 10% more every year.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.380]   Is there some simple math?
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.860]   - I would put it to you and your followers
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.660]   and be like, hey, we're going to run a calculator
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.220]   and you can put in your health degradation,
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.620]   all these formulas and we'll give you a better idea
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.700]   of what it's going to be worth to you
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.020]   later in life versus now.
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.820]   But for me, I just deeply think about it.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.620]   Like I sit down, like wakeboarding.
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.380]   There is no future wakeboarding, right?
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.420]   It might've been two wakeboarding trips later,
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.060]   spend the money, be with your friends, et cetera.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.060]   But generally, as you get older,
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.860]   I think the answer is like when you're 20, 22,
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.220]   maybe two ski trips, two and a half ski trips at 30
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.380]   is a much better deal.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.380]   You're more mature, you'll have your stuff together,
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.580]   other things been going on.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.260]   I'll have some friends that'll be bigger and better.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.860]   I can afford the upgrade, whatever.
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.060]   Maybe it's a better trip.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.180]   For me at 53, two ski trips is not the answer.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.700]   - I went on this trip, my wife and I,
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.740]   and I hadn't read your book.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.740]   So somehow I had this spark of let's quit our jobs
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.100]   and let's spend all our savings
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.500]   and let's backpack around the world for seven months.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.140]   And we did this in our 20s.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.140]   I am 100% certain that the money that we spent
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:08.380]   wouldn't even buy one trip around the world for two months
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.140]   now that we have a different lifestyle,
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.560]   we have kids and all this stuff.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.780]   So I think it's especially interesting
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.420]   for someone in their 20s or early 30s,
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.140]   foregoing that trip now isn't gonna let your money grow
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.660]   to be two trips because I'm almost certain
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.780]   that by the time that money is enough for the two trips,
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.500]   the cost of a trip is gonna be twice or three times as much.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.380]   It might not even be enough to go on one.
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.740]   - You're including also the economic inflation of the trip,
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.580]   also the fact that you become more bougie as you get older.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.500]   Like it's hard to do the youth hostel backpacking thing
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.420]   as you get older.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.620]   That's not even a physical thing.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.220]   That's like your attitude changes.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.260]   You realize that certain activities,
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.980]   going back to this time bucketing, belong in your 20s
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.540]   and they don't transfer well to your 30s.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.300]   Now you may be able to do them,
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.980]   but it's just not as enjoyable
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.820]   or it'll cost infinite more money or whatever it is.
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.780]   And that the 20s activity,
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.500]   not only do you get to enjoy it more,
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.340]   but you get to enjoy the discussion,
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.900]   the memories, the conversation.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.260]   It's the thing that makes you interesting.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.260]   Like when I sit down and talk with somebody at a dinner,
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.580]   I just met them,
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.860]   I'd say 80% of the conversation is what have they done?
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.140]   What experiences that they have?
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.460]   What were their learnings?
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.780]   What has been their journey?
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.700]   And maybe 20% is what they're going to do
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.540]   or what's going on currently, et cetera.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.060]   And that is what drives your fulfillment
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.020]   when you're meeting somebody.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.340]   It makes you an interesting character.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.900]   And so getting the order right and figuring out,
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.820]   hey, is it worth it to delay or not,
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.660]   is a very personal thing.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.660]   And it's very dependent on which activities
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.140]   or things fulfill you.
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.020]   But it's definitely the thought process
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.340]   that you want to go through.
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.340]   - My takeaway so far is,
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.460]   don't necessarily focus on accumulating money to all extent
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.980]   because you can use that money earlier
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.660]   to create experiences that provide value
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.740]   the rest of your life.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.340]   - If the purpose is I'm going to get the max value
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.660]   and I say the max value is fulfillment,
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.380]   you got to change your optimization algorithm in your head
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.340]   to optimize for fulfillment.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:05.340]   A lot of people keep optimizing for money.
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.340]   And I'm like, listen, okay,
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.300]   why don't you optimize for the most money at 86?
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.300]   And they'll obviously will go, no, that's dumb.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.260]   Well, it's the same thing is true at 85 or 84 or 83
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.060]   or any year, we should be optimizing for fulfillment.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.180]   Money is just a tool for your fulfillment.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.740]   You are not a tool to make money.
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.700]   And a lot of people operating in the latter, not the former.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.700]   - I want to come back to identifying that,
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.820]   but there's a couple of things on bucketing experiences
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.660]   and memoring them.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.900]   So we had a wedding as many people do,
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.380]   and we paid for a photographer, videographer,
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.260]   although many people that have listened know
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.420]   that we negotiated to pay for the videographer
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.020]   by swapping frequent flyer miles instead of dollars
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.100]   'cause we wanted to get a deal.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.540]   But looking back, that video has not been seen
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.580]   by millions of people, it's friends and family,
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.700]   and we've watched it every few years.
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.900]   But I think it's really reinforced the memory of the wedding
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.180]   and the photos do the same.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.500]   I'm curious if there are any other tactics
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.380]   that can enhance the dividends that our memories pay
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.060]   so that we can get more value of them after we have them.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.100]   - I think technology is doing something wonderful.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.900]   Google Photos or iPhones will do this.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.180]   They'll be on this date,
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.980]   and then photos will pop up of what happens.
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.100]   And then you get joy out of that,
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.420]   and it sparks a conversation.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.660]   You get fulfillment from an experience that you had
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.980]   and the recall of it.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.500]   So it's triggering and tapping in to your memory dividend,
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.460]   to your memories to provide you value.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.020]   One of the gifts my fiance at the time gave me was a box
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.260]   and it had photos and memories and little comments
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.100]   on what it was.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.060]   And I was like, "This is the best gift."
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.220]   Close to zero cost of any kind of purchase, et cetera,
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.260]   paper, cards, some photos printed out, et cetera,
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.300]   and her perspective.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.020]   But it was amazing on how much joy it was.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.460]   And really, I was just mining the prior experience
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.580]   and experience dividend.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.060]   If somebody comes up with another tool
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.820]   or another idea or another method, I'm open to it.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.740]   I really wanna mine the memory dividend
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.460]   and get the most out of my investments.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.540]   And my investments are, I invest in experiences
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.980]   'cause that's what fulfills me.
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.980]   Just like Warren Buffett says,
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.220]   "When do you start investing?"
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.180]   "Early, now, now, now."
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.060]   In order to get the maximum,
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.220]   what I call memory dividend, maximum return.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.340]   - Everyone says compound interest is so important.
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.020]   You should invest as early as you can
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.620]   to have the most money possible.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.700]   You're saying, "I have the same principle.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.460]   "It's just, I'm not optimizing for money."
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.700]   So invest, invest, invest as early as possible
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.020]   in the kinds of experiences
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.500]   that will maximize your fulfillment of life.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.860]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.780]   When people are focused on returns
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.820]   and compound interest, et cetera,
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.460]   they're optimizing for maximum money.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.820]   That's a vertical, your wealth, getting your wealth up.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.740]   And there's lots of books and lots of tools, tricks, hacks
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.460]   on how to get the most out of every dollar you spend,
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.620]   how to make the most money, et cetera.
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.220]   But I'm at a top level optimization.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.940]   I'm at a much higher optimization
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.020]   on like your life fulfillment, your net fulfillment.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.740]   And the memory dividend is a huge calculation in it.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.740]   And I really encourage people to invest
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.140]   in making those memory dividends,
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.220]   or at least think about that when you're deciding
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.540]   whether to delay gratification
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.540]   or actually have gratification now.
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.980]   - One thing that's helped me in this is
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.540]   if you think about the marginal dollar that you're saving,
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.940]   and so often I hear people,
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.460]   this is probably people with a little more money,
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.580]   but they're like, "Oh, well, I should save more money."
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.660]   And I'm like, "Well, why?"
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.820]   And they're like, "Well, then I'll have more money.
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:22.980]   "And I get a higher net worth."
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.900]   And I say, "Well, what's that next marginal dollar
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.140]   "gonna do for you?"
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.140]   Because people always say,
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.420]   "Well, if I save an extra $1,000 a month,
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.540]   "that's my kid's college."
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.060]   And it's like, "Well, do you already have
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:32.980]   "your kid's college saved?
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.100]   "'Cause if so, then what's that extra dollar doing?
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.020]   "And would that extra dollar
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.740]   "actually be better spent today?"
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.580]   - Yeah.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.540]   Going back to, I try and get people to map their money
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.340]   to what the consumption is.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.420]   A lot of people saving, they're like,
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.460]   "Oh, I'm saving, I'm working."
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.060]   I'm like, "Listen, it's okay to save.
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.920]   "Just tell me what the party is and when's the party.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.000]   "Just tell me when the party is.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.100]   "I'm okay with it."
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:53.940]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:54.760]   Like it gets them thinking like,
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.500]   "Oh, 65, no, that's not really when I have the party.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.860]   "Wait, what kind of party do I have?
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.780]   "What are the things I really wanna do?"
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.820]   Because what happens is, I believe,
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.540]   is people get habituated.
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.380]   They get really good at optimizing for money,
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.500]   making money, doing deals, whatever it is they are,
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.020]   programmers, et cetera, and they keep piling it.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:17.380]   And much like a rat in a wheel with a cheese experiment,
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.900]   pretty soon, you can just show 'em the wheel
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.980]   and not give 'em the cheese.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:20.940]   There's no reward.
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.760]   And so people are in default mode network
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.940]   of accumulating wealth, making money, earning money,
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.060]   optimizing money.
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.780]   I read the book on how to save on this.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.780]   I got 18 million flea court flyer miles.
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:32.760]   I discounted that.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.100]   Look at all these Chuck E. Cheese tokens I got.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.780]   And then they die with a bunch of Chuck E. Cheese tokens
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.780]   and never really go to Chuck E. Cheese.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.060]   And I'm like, "When you going to Chuck E. Cheese?"
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:43.900]   You know?
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.220]   You've been running this rat wheel, right?
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.620]   You got all these tickets, everything,
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.820]   but what are we buying here?
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.940]   What are we saving for?
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.860]   And I think people become detached
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.460]   from what their original dream was,
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.820]   what they really wanted to do,
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.300]   such that the game and the puzzle solving,
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:07.340]   people become addicted to the puzzle of saving more money,
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.420]   as opposed to being addicted to the puzzle
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.500]   of how do I fulfill my life?
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.660]   What potluck thing am I going to do?
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.580]   How do I expose myself to other things?
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.340]   What choices should I be making today?
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.020]   What experiences do I want in this time period of my life
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.180]   and the next time period of life?
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.260]   And how do those fit together?
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.580]   They're more focused on a different puzzle.
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.580]   - When it comes to these bucketing of experiences,
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.020]   is there a number of years that you say,
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.540]   "Well, try to bucket them in tranches of five years
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.000]   "or 10 years," or how do you think about that?
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.600]   So people can actually go home and be like,
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.860]   "Let's start doing this today."
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.300]   - I try and do five years.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.760]   Like when I got to my 65, I broke it out 65 to 75.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.600]   It gets wider.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.900]   And obviously, the further you go in future,
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.340]   the less your visibility, even for yourself.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.340]   Like, okay, yeah, 53 to 58, this is what I want to do.
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.180]   I want to do this.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.000]   I want to take a train.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.500]   I want to go to my daughter's graduation.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.720]   I want to stay healthy.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.700]   I want to go on a trip.
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.900]   I want to go to Tokyo again.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.700]   I have all those things kind of down, right?
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.660]   And then the next five years, it gets harder.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.420]   I kind of think I want to be doing this, right?
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.120]   They're a little bit more thematic.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.580]   And then 65, 75, 75 to the grave,
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.140]   it gets even more thematic.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.420]   But I can tell you that when I look at those choices,
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.420]   when I try and time bucket my life,
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.620]   I can see the level of activity going down.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.500]   I see it harder for me to spend money.
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.900]   It's like visit grandchildren, hang out with daughters,
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.900]   read the books I haven't read.
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.180]   It's not like go raging, stay up till 7 a.m.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.100]   in a club in Tokyo, travel here, swim that.
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.280]   If you could perfectly lay out the experiences
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.980]   you wanted to have, which you can't,
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.500]   you would see this natural curve
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.900]   in the cost of those experiences,
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.940]   this natural consumption pattern.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.940]   And then you start to say,
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.940]   well, I don't want to give up hours of my life
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.340]   for a bunch of Chuck E. Cheese tokens
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.740]   that I'm not going to use.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.900]   So I'm going to go to Chuck E. Cheese.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.940]   And then you start to lay out,
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.340]   well, I'm probably going to go to Chuck E. Cheese a lot here.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.500]   I'll play the whack-a-mole game.
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.340]   That costs a lot.
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.160]   And I'll do whatever.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.000]   And then another time,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.540]   I'm just going to sit around and eat pizza.
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.340]   And then you have this nice, beautiful curve
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.580]   on consuming and spending your money down to zero
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.060]   as you have the most fulfilling Chuck E. Cheese experience.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.580]   Basically the most fulfilling life.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.980]   Now I don't know why I'm stuck on Chuck E. Cheese,
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.100]   but I am for some reason.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.060]   This is strange, but two nights ago,
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.500]   we talked about Chuck E. Cheese randomly.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.700]   And I was showing our au pair from Spain
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.620]   what Chuck E. Cheese was because she was like,
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.780]   I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.260]   I was like, man, Chuck E. Cheese has kind of become
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.420]   a more depressing place than I remember it in my childhood.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.300]   You're talking about it.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.540]   I'm like, oh man, don't want to be the Chuck E. Cheese guy.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.740]   I don't want to be going there in my fifties.
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.060]   - It's kind of, to me, like cold water.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.060]   It was like going into the Atlantic ocean.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.100]   I was like, wow, I used to go in here as a kid all the time.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:40.940]   Like, no problem.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.780]   Now it's freezing.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.860]   I would never go in there.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.020]   That's kind of like an activity.
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.500]   If you're in heaven, it's like go swimming and frolicking
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.500]   and body surfing in the Atlantic ocean.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.700]   You're probably not going to enjoy it
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.020]   as much as when you were nine or five
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.940]   and immune to the cold for whatever reason,
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.020]   because it was just so we, to when you're like 20 something,
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.300]   you're like, this is freezing.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.340]   Like, why am I here?
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.180]   That type of thing.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.740]   - Are there any experiences that maybe you regret
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.380]   not doing more of younger or things that people listening
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.140]   in their twenties and thirties should maybe prioritize more?
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.740]   - Yeah, I think it's very personal
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.460]   and it has to do with like travel,
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.220]   that kind of backpacking experience,
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.260]   that kind of gap year thing that people do.
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.500]   I just really didn't take advantage of that time period.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.740]   I was so focused on trying to get ahead
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.820]   and make money and not taking breaks
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:28.300]   and was on this autopilot of like must succeed.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.260]   And not saying that wasn't a great focus
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.700]   and didn't help me get to here,
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.220]   but the success I want is the most fulfilling life.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.700]   And I gave up things that would have been
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.980]   extremely fulfilling, not only then,
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.420]   but now as I look back on my life.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.740]   And that's going to be different for everybody.
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.060]   I'd be like, ah, I wish I went to go play
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.940]   in this chess tournament.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.100]   It could be anything.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.180]   I knew at an early age that travel and meeting new cultures
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.420]   and doing adventurous things really fulfills me.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.940]   I really enjoy that.
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.580]   And I did not take advantage of those opportunities
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.140]   that I had.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.620]   I didn't really think about the context.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.460]   I'm like, you know what?
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.180]   I can go to a club in Manhattan any day.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.940]   I can hang out on this weekend, any day.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.540]   Like, why don't I get the super saver ticket,
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.300]   go here for the weekend, come back, et cetera.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.340]   That type of thing.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.100]   I was really lucky because I got laid off in 2008.
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.740]   And so I didn't have a job.
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.460]   And my wife was working at a company
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.140]   that she just absolutely hated
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.100]   and didn't want to stay in that field.
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.300]   And so we kind of got forced in this situation
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.220]   where she was like, well, I'm going to quit my job
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.300]   and I don't know what's next.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.020]   And I already didn't have a job.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.100]   So we ended up taking this trip for, I don't know,
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.220]   seven months backpacking, just as you describe.
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.740]   But I think it would have been so much harder
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.500]   had at least one of us not been forced out of a job
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.300]   and kind of pushed into this.
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.940]   And so what I'm curious to get your take on
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.380]   is the culture of work in America, at least,
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.300]   and probably many other countries,
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.660]   makes it so hard to be like, let's take a year off.
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.220]   And now I'm thinking in 30s and 40s,
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.420]   let's cut back so I'm not grinding so hard.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.740]   Or my wife's thinking in her career,
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.260]   she's like, oh, wow, if I ever got another job,
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.580]   like it's got to level it up, got to level it up.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.980]   Whereas usually leveling it up
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.780]   is more responsibility and more time.
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.220]   How can people in the work environment
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.300]   we've created in this country still live to these ideals
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.220]   and not get caught in that hamster wheel?
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.060]   - Wow, it's really tough to escape your culture, right?
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.540]   It's extremely tough.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.500]   Culture changes slowly.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.420]   Regards to work and optimizing
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.820]   for not being afraid of running out of money
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.780]   and status and having more and more money,
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.740]   it's really hard to step back and go,
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.900]   wait, does this serve me?
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.580]   Does this serve my one and only life that I have?
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.740]   Is this really going to fulfill me?
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.380]   Or have I become a robot hamster in a wheel,
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.260]   grinding and puzzle addicted to solving this puzzle
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.220]   called more money, more status, more fame, et cetera.
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.260]   I call that autopilot.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.140]   I say, we're always on autopilot.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.020]   I'm on autopilot just as much as the next person.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.940]   And we have to snap out of it and be like,
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.420]   what really fulfills me?
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.220]   What do I really want out of life?
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.540]   What do I really want out of life
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.060]   out of these next five years?
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.860]   We're so trained, like, I want the promotion
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.700]   and I want the thing.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.700]   Well, why do you want the promotion?
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.620]   Because the promotion, the thing, and I have more money.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.380]   Well, why do you want the more money?
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.860]   'Cause the more money is better.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.660]   The thing, it's all the way down.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:22.380]   It's so inculcated into us about success.
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.980]   Success is more money.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.700]   And it's so abstract that we lose the final connection
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.300]   that money is an abstract.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.140]   It's a tool.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:29.980]   It's like a hammer and a saw.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.900]   Builders don't want hammers and saws
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.580]   because they love hammers and saws.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.580]   They want hammers and saws to build houses.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.900]   That is the goal.
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.420]   They're not like, must accumulate more hammers and saws,
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.460]   more hammers and saws.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.420]   This is how people are.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.860]   They're like, we must accumulate more money
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:46.220]   to have more money, to more money, money, money.
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.900]   And I'm like, no life, motherfucker.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.220]   We're here to fulfill your life.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:53.180]   You are solving the wrong problem.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.460]   You're optimizing for the wrong problem.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:00.020]   And culture has pretty much jammed that on everyone.
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.020]   Really hard because there's this fear of not having money.
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.100]   You don't want to run out of money
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.500]   and fear of retirement is this whole fear game
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.860]   with retirement.
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.620]   People ask, why do old people keep growing their wealth
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.460]   while they're older?
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.980]   And I'm just like, they can't spend it down.
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:13.980]   Life has passed them by.
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.100]   That's the cold hard truth.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.300]   I'm really harsh about that.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.020]   I'm like, they fucked it up.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.260]   That's why they can't spend it down.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.860]   They fucked it up.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.660]   And it's too late for them.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.420]   My book, these algorithms, these mental models
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.460]   are to help you not fuck it up as much.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.660]   We're all gonna fuck it up a little bit.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.740]   Like it can't be perfect,
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.900]   but it's like, let's not fuck it up.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.420]   I use Daffy to organize all my giving
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.860]   and charitable tax savings in one place.
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.700]   And I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:41.980]   for this episode.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.940]   Daffy is a new modern way to give
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.340]   that makes it so much easier to maximize
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.900]   your charitable deductions,
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.180]   especially before the upcoming December 31st deadline.
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.980]   And pro tip, you should always donate appreciated stocks,
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.460]   ETFs or crypto over cash if you can.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.900]   You'll avoid paying capital gains taxes
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.340]   and you'll immediately claim the full value
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.340]   as a charitable deduction in the year
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.900]   you make the donation.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.780]   Plus, the charity gets more money
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.540]   when you donate the stock directly
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.860]   because they never have to pay
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.420]   the capital gains tax either.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.140]   So it's a win-win.
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.060]   Daffy makes it easy to donate stocks, ETFs or crypto
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.260]   to nearly any charity, non-profit,
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.260]   place of worship or school in the US.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.460]   To learn more about charitable tax savings
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.060]   and to make all your tax deductible donations
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.300]   before year end in one place,
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.420]   go to allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.260]   Also, it's free to get started
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.620]   and there is a special offer
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.380]   when you donate stocks, ETFs or crypto this year.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:44.660]   Just go to allthehacks.com/DAFFY.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:48.580]   - Hey everyone, Amy here, Chris's wife.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.300]   I convinced him to let me do this today
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.740]   because I am truly obsessed with Viorey
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.340]   and I'm so excited they're partnering for this episode.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.060]   Viorey makes performance apparel
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.380]   that's designed to work out in,
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.580]   but also looks great in everyday life outside of the gym.
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.980]   It is so versatile, buttery soft and stylish
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.020]   that I wear it out to drinks with friends,
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.820]   on morning runs, to work meetings and when I'm traveling.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.980]   Honestly, I'm decked out in Viorey every single day
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.220]   because why choose between comfort and style
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.500]   when you can have both?
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.780]   Some of my favorites are the daily leggings,
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.300]   the mudra fitted tee and the Sunday performance joggers.
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.780]   In fact, if you all do nothing else,
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.180]   get their Sunday performance joggers.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.340]   Hands down, they're incredible.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.940]   They come in men's and women's
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.620]   and they are the best article of clothing I own.
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.340]   I've also gifted Viorey to friends and family enough now
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.980]   to know that it's my go-to gift
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.180]   because it's always going to be a winner.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.020]   Pro tip with the holidays coming up.
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.580]   And for All The Hacks listeners,

[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.600]   and get yourself the greatest clothing on the planet.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.040]   - I worked with this woman whose job is to kind of
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.240]   help people take their outlook on life
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.600]   that might have some different
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.080]   unconventional contrarian thoughts
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.840]   and really boil it down to some framework, some model.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.120]   And we kind of arrived at like my nine principles
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.360]   of living an optimized life.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.140]   And I'm not ready to share them all yet,
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.120]   but one of them was questioning the outcome
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.600]   you actually want.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.840]   And I want to bring it up because
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.680]   of what you just said earlier.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.240]   Met someone who said, "Gosh, I need more money."
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.560]   And I was like, "Why do you need more money?"
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.280]   And they said, "I want to spend more time with my kids.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.240]   "And if I have more money, I'll be able to retire sooner
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.600]   "and spend more time with my kids."
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.320]   And through this conversation, we were like,
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.960]   "What if you had a different job
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.540]   "that earned you a little less money,
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.480]   "but gave you the freedom to work four days a week.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.800]   "And now you have a whole day that you could spend more time
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.880]   "with your kids and you weren't grinding as hard."
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.120]   And they're like, "Well, then I wouldn't have any money."
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.940]   And I was like, "You don't need the more money anymore
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.340]   "because you don't need to retire early
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.100]   "to spend your time with your kids at 50.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.740]   "You could start spending it now."
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.900]   And in product management, when we're building software
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.460]   and talking to customers, we always ask the five whys.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.620]   So if someone says, "Oh, I want this."
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.420]   And it's like, you got to ask why five times
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.660]   before you actually understand what someone wants.
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.060]   So I'll challenge people thinking they want more money
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.980]   to go through that thought experiment themselves
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.260]   of being like, "Why do you want the more money?"
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.700]   And drill down and then ask yourself,
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.060]   "Is there actually, once you get to that fifth why,
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.140]   "a way you could achieve what you want
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.660]   "that actually isn't about just accumulating more money?"
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.660]   And I would argue that more often than not,
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.800]   the answer will be yes.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.060]   - The book, "Your Money or Your Life"
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.380]   kind of hits on this concept of enough
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.060]   and what are you really solving for.
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.220]   You're doing like spend more time with your kids,
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.780]   but I'm making more money to save time with your kids.
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.100]   But if you make more money, are they really kids then?
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.580]   Do they want to spend time with you?
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.920]   There's a lot of variables going on,
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.940]   but going through that thought experiment,
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.340]   you actually get to pull out more from them.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.100]   They're like, "It's really about the status.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.820]   "It's really because you've been habituated
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.020]   "into making more money."
[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:48.500]   There may be this desire to spend more time with your kids,
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.740]   but it's not the real reason.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.520]   There's other reasons, whether they be habit
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.100]   or some sort of goal, et cetera,
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.060]   that we gotta address, we gotta look at
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.900]   and be like, "Do those reasons serve you?"
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.060]   - What would you say to someone,
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.860]   let's say in their mid-30s,
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.380]   who's got a great job and looking to do something new
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.260]   and feeling like the only option
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.420]   is to go take that next level up job
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.020]   that's gonna be higher pay and more responsibility
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.500]   and probably limit their ability
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.940]   to have the kinds of experiences they want
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.460]   because they're so engulfed in work,
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.700]   but they're stressed out because they feel like
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.780]   doing anything else would be a downgrade in their career.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.180]   How would you talk them through that?
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.180]   - The main thing is what are we solving for?
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.420]   And all of them, the first variable,
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.100]   the second variable, and the third variable.
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.420]   And how can we max them out?
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.280]   They're like, "Oh, I wanna actually spend time
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.860]   "and have more fun and do X, Y, and Z."
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.460]   And I'd be like, "Whoa, okay, this is one of 'em.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.940]   "I'm gonna be my own insurance agent."
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.100]   I talk about that in a book.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.020]   People try and basically be their own insurance agent
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.540]   by saving enough money for every single calamity.
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.980]   That's their backup default skew.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.140]   Well, just what if this happens?
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.020]   What if that happens?
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.420]   I try and find these things
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.340]   that they're actually solving for
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.580]   and then help them make the decision
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.300]   on what's the best decision for them.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.500]   We may come to the conclusion
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.420]   that taking on more responsibility now
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.100]   because the job pays so much damn money
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.580]   and then quitting in a year
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.780]   will actually lead to more fulfillment and more fun,
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.900]   and then I'll quit and I'll goof off and do whatever.
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.740]   The stock options are gonna go into money
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.060]   and I'm gonna make a zillion dollars
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.540]   and I'm gonna have seven years of just bliss
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.420]   and goofing off as opposed to grinding it out
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.460]   five years in this lower paying job, et cetera.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.780]   I'll have 100% of the time.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.300]   But that's usually the rarity in these scenarios.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.140]   - And they never quit.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.060]   - Yeah, they never quit.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.020]   It's like, you don't have to quit your job.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.940]   You just have to consume the fruits of your labor.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.660]   You have to get everything.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.980]   You have to find your balance.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.060]   You can love what you do,
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:38.420]   but you should also be able to do what you love.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.380]   A lot of people went to work 'cause they wanted a house
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.460]   and they wanted to have kids
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.300]   and they wanted to travel and they wanted to ski
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.220]   and they wanted to start a rock band
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.340]   or some expensive hobby with telescopes or whatever it is.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.820]   And somewhere along the way,
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.020]   those things kind of fall to the wayside.
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.220]   They don't exist anymore.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.780]   And it's the money and whatever.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.500]   And we kind of instinctively attack some sort of reason.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.660]   Oh, the kids.
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.900]   I'm gonna spend more time on my kids.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.700]   I'm like, nah, no, you don't.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.500]   That's not what you're solving for with this job.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.260]   Or at least this equation doesn't compute.
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.100]   If they were my friends, like real close friends,
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.980]   I'm like, no, you don't.
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.580]   You're bullshitting yourself.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.420]   You can lie to me, but just don't lie to yourself.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.780]   And then we go through it.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.500]   And a more gentle approach is let's just see
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.940]   if this formula computes.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.900]   Let's put it up on the board.
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.180]   Let's map out the time, get really detailed.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.820]   Like, okay, how much more money are you gonna get?
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.300]   When are you gonna have the time?
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.700]   How much more spare time are you gonna have?
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.580]   When does this happen?
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.540]   Is your kid still a kid?
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:35.980]   Do they still wanna hang out with you?
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.380]   Okay, what's this other job?
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.020]   No two-hour commute.
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.700]   That's two hours a day you can have your kids.
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.060]   Well, it seems like if we're solving for time with the kid,
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.940]   this job may be better than this job
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.180]   because the money you accumulate,
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.620]   you really don't have the time to spend it
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.540]   'cause you're working harder
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.100]   and you have more responsibilities
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.260]   and it's in the future and your kid's not a kid anymore.
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.100]   And they're gone.
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.420]   We might come to that conclusion
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.340]   depending on what we put on the board.
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.060]   So much like you do, you're digging in.
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.020]   If I switch this and I fly this plane
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.420]   and I do this on Tuesday,
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:06.900]   I get the most frequent flyer miles.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.380]   You're optimizing for the most miles.
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.460]   I will look at a trip as like,
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.500]   yeah, miles is one of the things I'm optimizing for,
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.420]   but ultimately I'm optimizing for the best fucking trip
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.980]   and the most memory dividends
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.860]   and the most fulfillment out of this trip.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:22.220]   So that's number one priority and number two is the miles.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.460]   - I think when we went to South Africa
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:24.380]   for this trip around the world,
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.540]   we had like five layovers
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.860]   because we stopped at one place,
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.180]   then we changed planes and the plane landed in Sudan,
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.420]   but we couldn't even get off the plane.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.220]   So we just sat there until it took off again
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.580]   and all this stuff.
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.380]   Now I'm like, how can I get there with zero to one stop?
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.940]   If it's really far, one stop.
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.580]   If it's really close, zero stops.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.420]   And that's forced me to reprioritize what I want.
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:44.460]   I wanna talk about a few things.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.340]   How do we implement this?
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.420]   But maybe first some of the common objections
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.140]   to changing this.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.540]   So two things you talked about.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.380]   One is preventing running out of money.
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.420]   I think everyone I know is like,
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.820]   oh, I wanna make sure I have enough.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.060]   What if I live to 110?
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.500]   What if health gets so great that I'm living forever?
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.300]   What do you tell to people who are trying to optimize
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.580]   for every possible thing that could happen?
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.700]   How to just get either comfortable with the risk
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:08.540]   that they don't need it?
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.700]   Or you even mentioned the book, just get an annuity.
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.180]   - If you're worried about running out of money,
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.020]   get an annuity.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.220]   Get the reverse of life insurance.
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.300]   Everybody gets life insurance, right?
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.220]   They're like, oh, I have life insurance
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.460]   if I die early, et cetera.
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.380]   Well, if you're worried about living too long,
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.580]   it's the exact opposite.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.940]   They have an insurance product for that.
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.060]   Or they're worried about what if I need nurses or whatever?
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:29.380]   I'm like, long-term healthcare insurance is pretty cheap.
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.500]   It's actually very cheap.
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:32.500]   Because I think one of the reasons is
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.540]   when you need those nurses, you're on your way out.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.900]   They're not gonna be paying that long.
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:36.860]   But it's pretty cheap.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.660]   Particularly if you get it while you're younger,
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:42.020]   30s and 40s, it's actually trivial for people,
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.220]   the wealth category that you're talking about.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.860]   I look at things that people are acting
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.620]   as an insurance agent inefficiently,
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.180]   and I'm like, let's be more efficient
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:53.220]   on how we insure away these risks.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.300]   And it might be an insurance product, et cetera.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.640]   And some of the things that, let's say,
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.280]   there's not an insurance product
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.300]   or whatever their fear of, I try and convert their fear
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.940]   of you should fear wasting your life
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.420]   more than you fear running out of money.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.100]   I try and redirect them to that.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.500]   What are the things you wanna have?
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.780]   What experience you wanna have when this is your life,
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:14.540]   you will die, it doesn't go on forever.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.500]   What is urgent to you?
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.780]   And what is urgent for each period?
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.780]   When we have that conversation,
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.580]   in my presence and their presence,
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.660]   while I think about it, you're like, yeah, you're right.
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.520]   The key is to keep them on that.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.060]   Because you have that conversation and they go back
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.060]   and they're right back on the autopilot.
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.300]   Let's go running the wheel
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.540]   'cause it's fun to run the wheel.
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.140]   No tease, no reward, no fulfilling life.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.540]   Just a battery, a robot, a cog in the wheel
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.180]   for the economic system.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.900]   I implore them to stay focused on,
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.860]   always attach your efforts to what the goal,
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.340]   what the consumption is.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.980]   So that is how I get them on the goal.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.560]   And in every single objection,
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.780]   whether it's what if I live too long,
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.940]   what if I need long-term care, insurance, et cetera,
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.860]   there is a way to minimize that risk
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.940]   or mitigate that risk more efficiently
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.500]   than the way they are doing it right now.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.620]   Because honestly, they've just been doing it on autopilot.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:09.460]   It's just a backstop reason to back up why they're doing it.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.020]   You know how some behaviors you'll just do 'em
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.260]   and then you'll throw a reason after the fact
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.460]   on why you're doing it?
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.680]   And you're just doing it because it's on autopilot?
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.700]   That's a lot of those reasons.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.580]   Well, I'm working real hard because of whatever.
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.980]   What if I get sick?
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.700]   Like, okay, when you get sick
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.060]   and it's $20,000 a night in the hospital bed,
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.420]   are you really the insurance agent?
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.780]   No, you're buying insurance for that.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:28.980]   Let's really think this through.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:32.260]   So when you're sitting across someone,
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.100]   sometimes it's a lot of chalkboard work.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.940]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:36.100]   It's a lot of going through it.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:36.940]   And that's why I tell people,
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.900]   like, you need to sit down and think about this honestly
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.300]   with yourself and work through these priorities
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.460]   and what your fear is.
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.340]   Let's go one by one to try to mitigate 'em
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:50.380]   because if we're solving for the most fulfilling life,
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.540]   everything else is secondary
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.700]   and everything else needs to be solved.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.220]   We wanna consume as much as possible in the right times.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:58.800]   - And you talk a lot about risk,
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.300]   but is it sometimes that risk is really just fear?
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.200]   - Yeah, it's just fucking fear.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.560]   And a lot of it's fear of embarrassment,
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.680]   fear of running out of money.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.840]   That is like the worst thing for people,
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:15.120]   not because they can't go get some basic job and survive,
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.520]   just the embarrassment, the status, the ego attached to it.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.520]   And I guess why, because like,
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.440]   if you run out of money or you were at high status
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.800]   and now you're working at McDonald's say, or whatever,
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.640]   and you get that shame and people mocking you, whatever,
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.120]   if you waste your life and die, nobody's mocking you.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.520]   You can't know, you're dead.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.400]   The people who are alive are like,
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.840]   "Wow, that fucking guy, what a clown, dude.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.000]   "That guy died with $4 billion.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.860]   "What a fucking idiot.
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.360]   "He got completely habituated
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.400]   "to be a cog in the fucking wheel.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.760]   "Great one, dude."
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.960]   "Thank you for your service.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.560]   "Thank you for putting out all this value,
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.960]   "getting a fraction of yourself and never using it,
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.680]   "and then donating 40% to the US Treasury.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.200]   "We fucking love that guy."
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.440]   They don't hear that, they're dead.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.120]   But if you somehow go start some business and it fails,
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.400]   people are like, "I told you so.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.360]   "I knew it was gonna happen.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.200]   "Shoulda, woulda, coulda."
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.960]   And your ego can't handle that.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.640]   So I always think it's fear.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.720]   And the fear is not the actual bad thing.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.560]   The fear is the ego associated with the failure.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.720]   But that's just me.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.160]   - It would help if society put more of an emphasis on like,
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.580]   "Wow, you didn't go and spend your money.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.920]   "You didn't go on a trip this year.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.400]   "You did nothing this year."
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.760]   - Yeah, somebody said,
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.040]   I put it to a bunch of 20-year-olds or a class
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.640]   or something is like,
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.880]   "Who would switch right now with Warren Buffet?"
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.700]   None of 'em.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:34.540]   None of 'em.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.800]   They're like, "Well, he's got X billion dollars or whatever.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.660]   "I don't wanna be that rich and old.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.700]   "There's no amount of money you can give me
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.280]   "to give up my life."
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.960]   So a lot of people are doing some version of this.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.400]   I always tell people there's no amount of money
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.020]   you can pay me to do five years in Sing Sing.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.540]   Maybe at 19 you coulda done it.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.040]   But right now, no amount of money.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.460]   And some people are doing some sort of version of jail,
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.680]   giving up their life for this money.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.240]   - I liked how you reframed someone
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.800]   who wouldn't take the risk to move,
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.400]   to make more money, to do something,
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.720]   as like they're paying to just sit still
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.560]   by not taking up an opportunity.
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.080]   I like these mindset shifts that you introduce in the book,
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.640]   which is just like, think about it this different way
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.720]   and maybe that'll help you get over that hurdle.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.760]   - Yeah, just quantify it.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.040]   And you may come to the same decision.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.240]   "Yes, I'm happy paying the fines sitting here."
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.760]   Or you might be like, "That's ludicrous.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.560]   "I actually would get much more money
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.840]   "and I would be able to spend more quality time
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.560]   "with the people I love that I'm leaving
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:28.620]   "than I do right now."
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.040]   I've had this conversation where people are like,
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:30.880]   "Oh, I don't wanna leave New York
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.900]   "because my mom's here and so-and-so's here," et cetera.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.620]   I was like, "Okay, let's break this down.
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.000]   "How many times do you see them?
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.200]   "A week, a month, okay.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.040]   "Let's write that down.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.560]   "And how many, all right, whatever.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.800]   "And then, okay, what's the money difference?
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.340]   "And then what's a plane ticket back and forth?"
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.140]   And then you could probably take 'em on vacation
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:48.980]   and you spend more time.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.800]   So, in theory, you can spend more time,
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.480]   more quality time, and make more money,
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.960]   expand your contact network, et cetera, with this move,
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.480]   even though you're saying you don't wanna move
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.240]   because of the people that are here.
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.640]   And sometimes that formula doesn't work out,
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.120]   but at least you go through the exercise.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.640]   And then you know you don't have this future regret,
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.240]   like you have this regret minimization.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.100]   You'd be like, "I made the right decision.
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.280]   "I went through all the avenues, et cetera.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.600]   "I actually get more time with my family by staying here.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.660]   "Or I've made the right decision.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.520]   "I've actually expanded my network, have more money,
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.820]   "and actually spent more time with the people I love
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.840]   "in a better way, in a better format,
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.340]   "in a more fulfilling format."
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.460]   And so, that's the book.
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.460]   This is the mental model.
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.140]   We're solving for net fulfillment.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.260]   - I did an interview, episode 40, with Dan Pink,
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.700]   who wrote a book about regret.
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.900]   And he talked about one of the big four regrets
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.340]   is a regret of boldness.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.080]   And people in their old age are like,
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.680]   "I just wish when I wanted to do this thing,
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.980]   "I went and did it."
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.740]   And I almost feel like a default assumption should be,
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.840]   instead of when you're thinking, "Should I move?
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.300]   "Should I go on this adventure?
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.380]   "Should I do this thing?"
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.220]   Just try to, every time, be like, "Should I not do it?"
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:05.420]   Try to always assume that you're going to do this bold thing
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.060]   and see if you can talk yourself out of it
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.700]   instead of talk yourself into it.
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.000]   It's not easy, but if you're ever faced
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.260]   with this kind of tough, "Should I do this big thing?"
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.060]   Just try to say, "Okay, let's assume I do it.
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.140]   "Why shouldn't I do it?"
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.820]   And I think that could help change that mindset.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.300]   'Cause I think it's hard.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.180]   One thing I did once, and you did a similar one
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.020]   that I think was more extreme,
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.620]   is I find that if you're ever worried about money,
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.280]   go experience what it's like to make money
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.780]   doing something without a job.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.460]   So for me, my wife was at Lyft and I was like,
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:32.980]   "I'm just gonna sign up for a Lyft driver."
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:33.960]   I did it for two reasons.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.940]   One, it was really rewarding to realize
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:41.140]   I can convert my time to money in a moment.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.420]   If I don't have a job, if I don't have anything,
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.980]   I could still convert it to money.
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.300]   The second thing it was good was
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.100]   it just put probably too low,
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.140]   but it put a threshold on what my time is worth.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.660]   And it helped me realize that like every hour
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:54.300]   I'm not driving my car around picking people up,
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.060]   I am spending money to not do that
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.540]   because I could be making money.
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.860]   You went panhandling just to try a similar experience.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.060]   - Yeah, I've done that.
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:04.580]   That was an exercise from an emotional intelligence class.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:07.340]   I went panhandling and it was really, really, really
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:08.780]   moving, enlightening, humbling,
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.060]   all these things at the same time.
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.860]   One, it was like, "Oh, I can survive."
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.220]   Like I can make $54,000 easy panhandling a year.
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.140]   That was the kind of annualized, I was running the rate
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.060]   and I didn't even really have a sign or anything.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.420]   I just took my shirt out, put it in size out,
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.980]   rubbed it on the concrete,
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.980]   and then just had a cup on a corner on an intersection.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.420]   And I was like, "Well, if I was at a busier intersection."
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.820]   You know, I was like doing the calculations, et cetera.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.620]   But I was like, I may be in a humbling situation,
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:39.660]   but I can make money just in a panhandling way.
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:41.220]   It was also kind of freeing.
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.580]   But I've always had that risk mindset.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:47.740]   Like I'll always be able to exchange hours of my life
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:51.140]   for money in order to eat, shelter myself.
[00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.180]   And I don't mean like, "Hey, I'm living high on the hog.
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.020]   I can get like these cheap ass apartments,
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.460]   these one bedrooms, et cetera."
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:57.780]   I will always be able to do that.
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.460]   So it liberates me to go,
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.820]   "There's really not that much downside."
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.860]   It's an ego downside, it's a humbling downside,
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:03.860]   but there's really not much downside.
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.180]   I should be swinging for the motherfucking fences,
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.300]   even more so.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.860]   Like I'm okay with it.
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.460]   - You don't really need to insure yourself
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:11.780]   against the risk that you run out of money
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.700]   because you've now established
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.660]   that like just sitting on the ground can make you money.
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.580]   You could do that when you're young,
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:18.500]   you could do that when you're old.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.260]   If you've established that you can,
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.060]   maybe you're comfortable not saving
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:26.140]   to insure against every possible risk.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.940]   - There's people out there who insure against these risks
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:29.780]   that you don't want to have.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:32.020]   These boogeymen that do it for less of a cost
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.260]   of you wasting your life.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.100]   Like they're more efficient.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.540]   Think, any kind of waste in your time,
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.980]   whether you're exchanging your time for money
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:40.860]   or your money for time, any kind of waste
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:42.740]   leads to less fulfillment.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.340]   And so you really want to be like,
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:47.780]   am I the right person to insure myself against this calamity
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.220]   or should I pay an insurance agent, whatever this fee is,
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.900]   and that will be more efficient,
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.820]   result in net fulfillment for me.
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.900]   When I look at this activity or whatever,
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.900]   should I be exchanging hours of my life for money
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.660]   or should it be the other way around?
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.500]   What's an hour of my time worth?
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.820]   At this level, at that level, et cetera.
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.460]   These are questions we should be asking ourselves
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.540]   all the time.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:12.340]   Is that shirt really worth two hours of my time?
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.380]   Am I going to get two hours of fulfillment out of it?
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.900]   Does that really fulfill me?
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.340]   You know, that was the beauty of your money or your life
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.180]   is that it really connected me with my values.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:22.340]   It really made me think what I want out of life,
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.340]   what I'm willing to give up an hour of my life for or not.
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:29.780]   And then also hit home that I really want a value
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.900]   of hour of my time to be extremely high.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.460]   I went the other way so that I didn't have to worry about it.
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:36.420]   But even after like, I'd not have to worry about it.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.020]   Now, let's say I have all these resources
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.620]   called wealth and I have my health.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.500]   How am I going to allocate this over my life
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:44.060]   to get the max fulfillment?
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:44.900]   That was the next step.
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:47.060]   I was like, great, now I'm rich.
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.380]   Now, what do I do?
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:50.140]   When should I spend it all?
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:50.980]   - Perfect.
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:51.820]   You just teed up what I want to talk about,
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.540]   which is like implementing this.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.620]   I now have a lot of the mindset ideas
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.140]   and the frameworks on how to do this.
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.660]   And when I left the book thinking, I was like, okay,
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.660]   how does someone figure out based on where I'm at today,
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.900]   should I be spending more money?
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.420]   Should I be spending less money?
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.620]   How do you answer that question?
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.460]   - It's a tricky question.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.060]   The first thing I ask is the experience
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.180]   that we all want for us is survival.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.620]   So have we survived for our survival number?
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.140]   So I introduced that concept of like,
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:20.580]   okay, when you no longer can work or et cetera,
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:23.900]   do you have enough to have the very basics
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.100]   like food, shelter, clothing?
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.380]   And depending on where you are, that's a different number.
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:31.700]   And then after that, like, how do I spend my money?
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.180]   I try and use health as a forcing function
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:37.620]   because it is on the allocation of spending money.
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:39.220]   I look at my parents, my ancestors.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:42.300]   We literally had to kidnap my mom
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.300]   to take her to Scotland for her 80th birthday.
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:46.140]   It was an ordeal.
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:46.980]   She had the time of her life,
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.980]   but it was like an ordeal to get it.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.660]   We're like, you're coming, whatever.
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:52.620]   We're getting you out here.
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.820]   But what I realized is that my mom
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.540]   does not consume much money at all.
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.580]   My grandmother did not consume much money at all.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:03.460]   My dad did not want to leave his apartment
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.300]   when he was coming home.
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.620]   Now, I always say I'm gonna be different
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:06.860]   'cause I'm gonna be in shape or whatever,
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.180]   but the reality is I'm going to be some version of that.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:13.740]   So I'm like, the idea that I'm going to be
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:18.740]   having this Chronicle Cruise life at 77 to 86 is bullshit.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.260]   I'm not gonna be consuming that much.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:24.220]   So I'm thinking if I'm going to have parties,
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:25.740]   if I'm going to travel,
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.720]   if I'm going to hike these mountains,
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.260]   if I'm going to do these activities,
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.780]   if I'm going to even just go on a walk in the park
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:36.780]   and do a seven mile hike with my kids, a free activity,
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:41.060]   those activities belong here and I need to consume them now.
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:43.880]   So even the free ones have to get bucketed.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:47.260]   And I always think about that aspect of it
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.500]   because I'm like, how do I allocate my fund
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.100]   once my survival is covered?
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:55.380]   There is no perfect answer, but I do look at that,
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:52:00.380]   hey, my net worth should be peaking between 45 and 55.
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:04.580]   And if I'm in the peak, how does this curve go down?
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.300]   And I try and match it for me.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:09.660]   I've been talking to these doctors like Peter Tia
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:12.000]   and Chris Renna, et cetera.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.340]   And what I really want to know is
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:15.260]   what is the pace of my body deteriorating?
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.940]   What is the pace of my mind deteriorating?
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.540]   What is the pace of my lung capacity deteriorating?
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:24.540]   And then I know like, oh, if you are this type of activity,
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:30.060]   your enjoyment of activity goes down linearly
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.380]   with this decline and your ability to do it
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:35.500]   completely cuts off once you reach this level.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.540]   Read somewhere, I think it's like two watt hours
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:39.380]   per kilogram to climb a flight of stairs
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.300]   or something like that.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:41.460]   There's like formulas out there.
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:42.580]   I'm like, oh, okay.
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:44.300]   So if you need to run and play soccer
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.260]   and jump and play basketball,
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.340]   you need X watt hours per kilogram of energy muscle
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:49.380]   and what that converts to.
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:53.140]   And then we know how many watt hours per kilogram
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.980]   people have as they age.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.660]   And I was like, wow, this would be great
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:59.060]   to figure out where my consumption is.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.820]   And that's what I was trying to build with this model.
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.260]   Like you're an optimizer and build this model.
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.500]   And I realized this is impossible.
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.180]   There's so many goddamn inputs.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:11.180]   So really it comes down to a mental model of each activity.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:15.460]   Like, okay, here's the straight line to the grave
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.100]   of spending down all my money.
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.300]   Here's kind of the curve I think it should be
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.100]   to get to my survival number, et cetera.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.820]   And then when I look at my time bucketing,
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:28.060]   wait a minute, I said I was gonna be spending less,
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.500]   but I like riding on trains
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:30.900]   and that doesn't take any energy,
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:31.900]   but it costs a lot of money.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.300]   So let's change the spending and the curves like this.
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.100]   So it's not gonna necessarily always be this perfect
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:39.420]   log normal curve down to zero from your peak.
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:41.420]   It could be, no, but there's trains
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.260]   and I wanna ride trains and then down.
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.140]   Each person is different.
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:46.580]   It really takes a lot of thinking,
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.140]   a lot of off autopilot
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.020]   'cause you have to know what you want.
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:53.460]   You have to have an idea at least 70% of what you want.
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.580]   A lot of it's gonna be discovery, potluck.
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:58.100]   And then you have to think about the wins.
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.460]   You have to be honest with yourself.
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:00.300]   A lot of people are like,
[00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:03.260]   "Oh, I'm in better shape than I was when I was 30 and 50."
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:04.420]   I'm like, "Well, that means you were just
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:05.860]   really out of shape at 30."
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:08.420]   And so that's it.
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.620]   And I know that's not like the answer people wanna hear.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:12.540]   They're like, "I want the spreadsheet and the formula
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.260]   and the detailed thing and I wanna be told."
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:18.500]   I present like kind of the macro top line.
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:20.500]   Your net fulfillment is an operation
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.740]   of your wealth, health and time.
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:23.900]   And I leave it to the crowd to go and be like,
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:25.820]   "I built this kick-ass spreadsheet."
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.380]   - So let me throw out my version,
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.660]   which is not yet a spreadsheet,
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:30.820]   but you had this formula where you're like,
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:33.620]   "Okay, your survival threshold is how much
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.500]   it's gonna cost you to live one year
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:38.060]   times the number of years left to live
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.840]   and then deduct 70% 'cause that money will grow
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.580]   and you can withdraw from it."
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.220]   So what I'm doing in my head is,
[00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.860]   okay, assuming you can make money,
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.500]   at some point you'll stop being able to make money
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.260]   and then you'll live for some number of years.
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.860]   Let's call that number 20.
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.540]   Okay, so you can live for 20 years.
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.420]   How much does it cost you to live in one year?
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.660]   I think everyone always estimates
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.540]   the highest amount it could ever cost you.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:04.340]   And I'm gonna use your standpoint of like,
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:06.500]   actually estimate low 'cause many people
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.900]   end up saving more than they think and spending less.
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:11.260]   So it doesn't make sense to go to the extremes.
[00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:13.640]   So let's say for the sake of math,
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:17.440]   you need $50,000 to live in your old age
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:22.440]   for 20 years times 0.7, that's $700,000,
[00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:24.020]   which might seem like a lot,
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.140]   but if you have your whole life to save that $700,000
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:28.780]   and let it grow and compound,
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.060]   I guess that would be a number
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.580]   that once you've saved an amount of money
[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:36.600]   that by the time you're, let's call it 65,
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:39.700]   you will have that, you could stop saving effectively.
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.340]   I didn't even include social security
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.340]   and all these other things.
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:45.280]   - It's not necessarily you can stop saving for survival.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.580]   Now it's maybe you wanna go on some big expensive trip
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:50.100]   when you're 75.
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.260]   Now we can start talking about our enjoyment,
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:54.340]   the things that fulfill us besides surviving.
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:55.940]   We can solve for thriving.
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:56:00.500]   - So you could decide I want to equally distribute
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.640]   my enjoyment of life over my life.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.620]   And then your goal is,
[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.180]   as long as you're putting aside enough
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.340]   to get to 700,000 by the time you're 65,
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:11.660]   well then every year you could just spend
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:15.080]   all the excess on enjoyment and you'd be fine.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.220]   What that wouldn't let you do is
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.860]   maybe you wanna take this crazy giant adventure
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:22.940]   when you're 45 or 50, you might wanna save for that.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:26.100]   But it made me think that if you've already saved enough
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:29.580]   that 30, 40 years from now it'll grow
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:32.820]   to be enough to survive in retirement,
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:35.300]   all of the excess you can maybe even think of
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.580]   as a separate bucket for enjoying life.
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:38.920]   How do I wanna distribute it?
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:43.700]   And separate your savings that's for living in retirement
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.840]   in a home, being able to feed yourself, there's that money.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.540]   And I think maybe one thing
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:49.500]   that I've never really thought of
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.540]   until I'm speaking it out loud right now is,
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:53.480]   in my mind I'm saving one amount of money
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.300]   that's savings for the future.
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.300]   But if we separated it out and said,
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:59.100]   okay well here's how much you've saved
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:01.660]   and let's set that aside 'cause you need it to live.
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.740]   Now the rest is all money you can spend however you want.
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:07.340]   And you need to make sure that balance also goes to zero.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:08.860]   Like the other one's probably gonna go to zero
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.060]   'cause you're gonna spend it in retirement.
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.860]   But that one needs to go to zero.
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.300]   - Correct, and that's what I do in the book.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.520]   If separating it out makes it easier for you
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.420]   to figure out what experiences do I bring forward
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:21.060]   or which money do I bring forward and spend now?
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.500]   And what do I push back in terms of just the fun bucket?
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:24.340]   My life is covered.
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.140]   Let's just say you had the best pension ever.
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:28.980]   Now it's just like, wee, where do I spend the money?
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:30.980]   So like you've covered your pension
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.140]   that covers your survival.
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:33.660]   Now it's like what fulfills you
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:37.180]   and when's the best time to consume those experiences
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:38.460]   that fulfill you?
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:41.700]   - And it's probably not when you're retired.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:45.140]   - For 99.999 many nines of people
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:46.820]   it's absolutely not.
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:49.460]   - Yeah, and particularly for Americans
[00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:52.580]   because we don't have the health for the activity.
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:53.660]   If I went to the Japanese,
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:57.380]   I would say the curves are distinctly different in Japan
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.460]   than they are in America.
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:00.300]   Because when you go to Japan,
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.540]   you'll see 80s and 90s old shopping, hanging out,
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:05.080]   cleaning, doing whatever, like having this very active life.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:05.920]   - Hiking.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.860]   - Hiking, doing whatever, all kinds of consumption.
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.300]   They're like, yeah, well, I'm gonna travel.
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.340]   I'm gonna go to Australia.
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:11.740]   And they'll be like, whoa, wait, what?
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.020]   You're 85 traveling by yourself going to Australia?
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:17.500]   They can actually consume it for most America, no shock.
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:18.340]   I've seen it.
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:21.140]   So many people die on cruise ships,
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.700]   getting out and trying to go swimming on the warm water,
[00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.220]   having heart attacks and stuff like that.
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:27.620]   It's amazing when you watch it in real life.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:29.020]   Like if you just observe it.
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:30.680]   I'm not saying I was out there with a lab coat,
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.760]   watching people, et cetera,
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:36.760]   but I've seen so many senior geared entertainment activities
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:40.140]   where it's really not that active.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:42.820]   - I love this idea of creating a bucket
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:43.660]   that is your pension
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:46.580]   and then the rest you decide how you spend over your life.
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:48.220]   And if that number is not decreasing,
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.300]   it sounds like by the time you're 55,
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:51.820]   non-pension side of it,
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:53.620]   you're probably doing something wrong.
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:55.660]   Or you figured out how to live much longer
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:57.500]   than I'm aware is possible.
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:01.300]   - You either have kind of like a abnormal time bucket
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.700]   where there's some sort of activity in the future
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:04.940]   that costs a lot of money.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:05.780]   And that can happen.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:08.640]   You can be like, I really love super yacht cruises
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.620]   and this is what I'm saving for.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:13.060]   And that's really gonna fulfill me the most.
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:14.100]   I don't really care about anything.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.740]   I really want to just play chess
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:18.460]   because my mental acuity is really stronger now
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.300]   and you're gonna be better at chess now.
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:21.140]   And I wanna win tournaments
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.420]   and I just wanna play chess tournaments.
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.220]   And then I wanna go on yacht trips later.
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:25.060]   And so you can be like, okay,
[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:26.540]   maybe you're not consuming the most money now.
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:31.540]   But by and large, the rule is it's now or it's a mistake.
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:32.980]   You're completely fucking it up.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.300]   You're doing life wrong.
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:35.940]   - And it's not just that it's now,
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:37.380]   it's that now benefits you.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:38.980]   I wanna recap what we talked about earlier.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.700]   It's like doing it now will also benefit you later.
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:42.980]   - Yeah, it benefits your future self
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:45.140]   because your future self reaps the memory dividends.
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:46.260]   Things you did in high school,
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.820]   the things you did in college,
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:50.100]   the trips you had, the honeymoon you had,
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:51.220]   the adventure you took,
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.700]   the business you started and failed,
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:56.020]   the business you started and succeeded.
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:58.500]   Like all those things right now,
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.480]   you are reaping the dividends right now.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.400]   And as I'm talking,
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.820]   there's probably people in the audience.
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:05.100]   Oh yeah, I remember that, remember that.
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.020]   They're like filled, right?
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.540]   They were getting the same endorphins, et cetera,
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:13.260]   a piece of that fulfillment as actually doing the activity.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:16.340]   My favorite thing on this is the Coke Pepsi experiment.
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.340]   Do you know about this one?
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:20.220]   That Pepsi tends to win in a blind taste test,
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.880]   but people, you know, Coke destroys them.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.180]   And it's because when you consume a Coke,
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.820]   you consume not only the Coke,
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:27.300]   but all the memories and the advertising
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.460]   associated with it.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.700]   'Cause it was more advertised
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.900]   and they've done this with fMRI.
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:35.360]   You literally consume the experiences
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.320]   when you have a Coke, your prior experiences.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.920]   You literally are getting memory dividends
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.440]   from the commercial and the advertising
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.660]   and the feel good and have a Coke and a smile
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.700]   and all that stuff.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.820]   The years and years of that in your brain
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.760]   is unlocked when you consume a Coke
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.220]   and you know it's a Coke.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.340]   Same thing happens with every same activity you have.
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:54.340]   It's like you access and partially relive
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.140]   every single experience that you have when you recall it.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.540]   And so I always say maximize positive life experiences.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.000]   - One of your memory dividend enhancements
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.700]   was like reunions with the people
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.420]   you enjoyed the memories with.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:09.320]   And I went on this crazy trip to Australia once
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.560]   where we basically had a bunch of money
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.520]   that we had to spend in seven days.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.400]   And so it was just kind of a wild, fun time.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.360]   And every time I hang out with my friend
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:18.480]   who we went on this trip with,
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.680]   it's not 100% we were there, but it's not zero.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.040]   I feel like we have a society
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.040]   where there were lots of family reunions
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.720]   because families are way more distributed.
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.640]   That kind of goes down.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.360]   And my wife and I have been talking about
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.480]   whether we have like, I don't know what you call this.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.960]   Like we have a second wedding
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.240]   where you just invite all of your best friends.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.720]   It's like what you did for your birthday.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.840]   Invite all the people you care about on some regular cadence
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.920]   get to really relive those memories and get all this value.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.860]   And you don't even have to do the things again.
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.680]   It's not a cultural thing to have friends reunions
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.880]   but I think we should.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.000]   - I was just joking recently,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.400]   like these dates on the calendars,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.540]   these events are just excuses for us to throw parties
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:52.960]   and see each other.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.400]   And somebody also just said to me,
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.800]   work is something we do
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.800]   so we have an excuse to hang out with each other.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.840]   Thought that was pretty powerful
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.240]   and that's true to a certain extent.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.120]   That's the people that, well, I love my job.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.720]   Well, you really love the people.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.240]   - I think that's a lot why people I know
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.680]   in the last few years being home and not seeing them,
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.880]   they're like, I hate my job.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.840]   It's like, well, maybe you don't hate your job.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.120]   Maybe it's just the thing that you thought you loved
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:13.960]   was your job.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:14.800]   And you actually just love the people
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.040]   you're around all the time.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.000]   And if you're not around them
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.440]   or you're just only seeing them on a screen or something
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.120]   and you don't have that social stuff, it feels different.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.480]   - I encourage people to deconstruct
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.120]   what is it about the job you love
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.560]   and has the job replaced other muscles?
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.780]   Have you atrophied your social muscle
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.040]   to go meet people and hang out and have dinner
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.520]   and go out to lunch with people
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.880]   because work is the only place that you did these things.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.760]   And so the thing you loved was,
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.200]   oh, wow, I let work consume everything.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.640]   Like I don't take vacations.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.840]   I don't do walks in parks.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.440]   I'm not really to the extent that I would like to do.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.880]   And I've let work take it all over.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.480]   It's how I met my spouse or my significant other.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.160]   It's where I go figure out to go eat.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.520]   It's where most of my dinner is going out on a town
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.040]   or business dinners or whatever.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.120]   Where I go to lunch is usually close to work, et cetera.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.880]   And those things are enjoyable,
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.720]   but it's not the work.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.120]   It's, I like going to lunch with people.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.160]   I like camaraderie.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.520]   I like seeing these people.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.880]   I like going to fancy dinners and stuff like that.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.240]   When people retire or quit these jobs sitting remote,
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.660]   they're like, fuck, I don't know what to do with myself.
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:20.640]   And I'm like, it's because you've atrophied
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:24.760]   all these other muscles and you put all your time
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.400]   into habituating yourself and to being very good
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.720]   at this thing.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.040]   And this thing has been your whole life, your whole world.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.880]   But it doesn't mean that's the optimal place
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.520]   for you to build social relationships,
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.360]   to find a mate, to pick dinner spots, to pick lunch spot.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.980]   It just became the default autopilot thing to do.
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.840]   - I've learned so much this past year
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.920]   from the classes I've taken on Masterclass,
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.720]   and I am excited to partner with them for this episode.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.880]   With Masterclass, you can learn from the world's best minds
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.000]   anytime, anywhere, and at your own pace.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.320]   You can learn songwriting from John Legend,
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.120]   improve your cooking skills from Gordon Ramsay,
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.600]   or learn business strategy from Bob Iger,
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.260]   which is especially interesting now
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.580]   that he's back in as CEO at Disney.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.800]   With over 100 classes from a range
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.720]   of world-class instructors,
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.280]   that thing you've always wanted to do
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.120]   is closer than you think.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.040]   One new class I'm really excited about
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.920]   is intentional eating with award-winning journalist
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.940]   Michael Pollan, who wrote "The Omnivore's Dilemma."
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:25.480]   Instead of being about restrictions or diets,
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.560]   it'll teach you how to eat more ethically,
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.000]   healthfully, and sustainably.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.600]   And with every class I've taken,
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.720]   I'm blown away by the depth of knowledge
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.940]   the instructors have and the quality of the experience.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.520]   And a Masterclass membership makes such a good gift
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.320]   for someone this holiday season.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.480]   I know, because I gifted it to my dad last year.
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.460]   I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:50.720]   This holiday, give one annual membership and get one free.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.040]   Go to allthehacks.com/masterclass today.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:57.800]   That's allthehacks.com/masterclass.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.760]   Terms apply.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:03.640]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.040]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.920]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.040]   for a good hang.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:14.120]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.080]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.000]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.960]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.720]   take care of the supplies.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.840]   All you need to come up with
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.560]   is the excuse to get together.
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.400]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.800]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.780]   that the sun finally came out,
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:31.260]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.320]   that you got through another week.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.440]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.960]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.760]   which means you can entice your friends
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.840]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.480]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.080]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.040]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.080]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.920]   while we were hosting family last week,
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.980]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.620]   delivered in less than an hour,
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:01.080]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.760]   So, whatever the occasion,
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:06.040]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.040]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.280]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.360]   I just wanna thank you quick
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.660]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:21.500]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.200]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.960]   and discounts from our partners,
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.520]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.680]   So, please consider supporting those who support us.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.920]   I've spent a bunch of time talking to people
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.600]   in the financial independence movement,
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.500]   people who are, let's save all the money we can,
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.520]   let's spend nothing so that we can be financially free.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.260]   Some want to retire early, some just want independence.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.600]   What's your take on FIRE?
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:47.420]   I have a couple of takes.
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:48.260]   The things I like about it
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.700]   and the things I absolutely hate.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:52.760]   The thing I like about it is the FIRE movement
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.100]   forces you to be aware of the concept of enough.
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.120]   It forces you to get on autopilot,
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.920]   what things are important to me,
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.640]   what am I consuming because I really enjoy it
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.480]   and it fulfills me,
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.280]   and what am I consuming just to consume it,
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.880]   like advertising and I'm on some sort
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.540]   of consumption autopilot.
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.640]   It really gets them to think about their lives
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.480]   in a totality, what the things
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.640]   that they really wanna be doing,
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.460]   like I really wanna do this for the rest of my life,
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:17.520]   I really wanna do this for my life,
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:21.200]   and they use FIRE as a tool to get that.
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.360]   Things I hate about FIRE.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.600]   One is they all follow this model of,
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.440]   I'm gonna work, work, work,
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.040]   I'm gonna save up this money
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.380]   and I'm going to live off the interest.
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.820]   And I'm like, what about the fucking principle?
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:34.380]   You gotta spend down the principle.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:38.620]   It's all about not giving your life away to money
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:39.740]   but having an enjoyable life,
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.760]   but like you're giving your life away to money
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.140]   that you're never gonna spend down.
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:44.780]   So they need to readjust their formulas
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:46.940]   to include spending down the principle, okay?
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:51.180]   Two, at the extreme, these guys are doing a version
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.100]   of autopilot and making a fatal error
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.780]   of not paying attention to time bucketing
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.720]   and the power of memory dividends.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.700]   They're basically doing a version of,
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.500]   I'm going to go to jail for seven years or 10 years
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:08.500]   in order to be free and have a great life from 40 on,
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:09.980]   or whatever their retirement age is.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.180]   Going back to my original statement,
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:12.460]   there's no amount of money you can pay me
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.060]   to do five years in Sing Sing.
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.660]   Well, these guys are doing 10, 12 year stints in Sing Sing.
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.580]   And there are certain activities,
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.760]   certain expenditures that you should be having
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:25.760]   that only fit in that 30 to 45 bucket.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:29.260]   They're giving that up unconsciously
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.780]   for some future Shangri-La.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:33.220]   And then they get to the future Shangri-La,
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:34.700]   and I'm not saying it's not great,
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:38.800]   but like, fuck, I really regret not doing X, Y, and Z.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:41.620]   Or I should have done this when grandmother was alive.
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:43.580]   Or I should have done this when my kids were young
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:44.900]   and we should have went to Disney World
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.980]   instead of saving money to go on an extra trip now.
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:51.900]   At the extreme, FIRE is another version of autopilot.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:55.820]   It's not really correctly solving for net fulfillment,
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:57.800]   and there needs to be some adjustments.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.180]   - Somewhere in the middle between the FIRE autopilot
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:03.060]   and the standard American autopilot is probably optimal.
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.420]   - Yeah, it's definitely great.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.100]   It's just like, okay, these are people who like,
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.780]   they got the spreadsheet, they're in touch
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:09.660]   with what they want, they know the concept of nothing.
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:11.860]   I'm like, guys, why are you not spending on a principal?
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:13.820]   This is craziness.
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.060]   You're trying to get the most out of life,
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:18.340]   but you exchange 10 years of your life
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:20.900]   for something that you're never gonna consume.
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:23.060]   You're just gonna consume the drips and drabs of it.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.500]   - Is that like the 2% rule?
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.460]   I'm making it up, but it's like,
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:29.020]   if you could live off the interest at 4% forever,
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:32.680]   what would you need to just not spend at all?
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.660]   - What I tell these people is that basically,
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:35.820]   you're overworking.
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:38.540]   You're giving up an extra two or three years of your life
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:41.180]   because you're not including spending down the principal.
[01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.260]   You're overshooting.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:45.020]   The main thing is though, that autopilot
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:48.780]   really leads to future regret with certain experiences
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:50.180]   if they're not really conscious
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.920]   about what experiences belong when.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.960]   - You didn't mention one criticism that I have,
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.460]   which is it assumes often,
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.580]   at least with the retire early side,
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.100]   that once you stop working, you don't make money.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.780]   And I think most people, I'm sure there are exceptions,
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:10.780]   but most people can't just do nothing for 50 years,
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.140]   especially when those years are in your 30s and 40s
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:15.260]   and 50s and 60s.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:18.780]   So I think if you assume you're not gonna work at all,
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:20.780]   then you need so much money.
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:23.820]   But if you assume maybe you could work some,
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.980]   then it changes the calculus wildly.
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:28.880]   Like you go from needing millions and millions of dollars
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.480]   to maybe even hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:35.660]   - Yeah, the sledgehammer of fire in our culture
[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:38.940]   is probably more needed than not the sledgehammer of fire
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.460]   because we have so many people just needlessly attached
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.320]   to things that don't serve them
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.780]   that they don't even really want.
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:49.960]   But there's plenty of criticism of the fire's autopilot
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.660]   and that sledgehammer and that kind of militant,
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.280]   I'm gonna save for this and whatever.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.260]   There's these assumptions in there that are not true.
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:59.220]   You pointed out that, yeah, you're probably gonna work
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:01.380]   or have a side hustle or sell your art
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:02.500]   that you're gonna make or whatever.
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.180]   There'll be some form of income that you could have
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.060]   or you will have.
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.600]   Not everybody, somebody's gonna be like, not me,
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.260]   I'm going backpacking and I'm not making a dime.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:11.300]   Okay, you're that guy.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.700]   There is a version of autopilot and fire and it's dangerous
[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.680]   because I'm talking about wasting your life.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.420]   And when you say, I'm gonna grind, not consume,
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.940]   not go anywhere for 10 years, I'm like,
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:25.740]   that's a lot of fucking life or 15 years to be giving away.
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.680]   That's extremely dangerous in the net fulfillment game,
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.260]   in the not waste your life game.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:33.700]   - I'm much more comfortable with if there was a way
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:37.140]   to reframe it as like, you need this much money
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:39.700]   to experiment with financial independence
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.220]   for a period of time, which is like maybe change your job
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.680]   to a job that pays less, that gives you the time you want.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.660]   But that number is so much smaller
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:49.900]   that you don't need to save it by giving up everything.
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:51.740]   So I'm gonna challenge anyone in the audience
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.900]   and email me, just Chris at AllTheHacks.
[01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.020]   If anyone wants to try to like build a model
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.300]   or a framework or something to try to create
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:00.140]   this middle ground, I wanna see it.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.380]   I wanna get in the spreadsheet.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.060]   I wanna build the model with you and see if we could do it.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.140]   - You have to take an individualistic approach though.
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:07.900]   The problem with like building a spreadsheet
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:11.420]   for just the masses is that everyone is different
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.700]   and everybody has different things that fulfill them,
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.620]   which means they're always gonna have different spend curves
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:17.460]   and different needs.
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:19.740]   And you'd be like, yeah, the thing you want,
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:22.060]   you really need to just bust your ass for two years
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:22.980]   and get it, right?
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:25.380]   'Cause there's this step function and cost.
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:27.260]   Like the only thing I want is a trip to Mars
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:29.500]   and that ticket costs $225,000.
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.500]   Well, okay, there's no half going to Mars.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.700]   You have to get the $225,000 or whatever the price is.
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.820]   I'm making that up.
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.700]   But if it's like, I like roller skating
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.660]   and I like hanging out with my kids and I like whatever.
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:40.660]   And then there's some middle ground.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.540]   You can still roller skate.
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:42.540]   Let's go roller skating now.
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:43.740]   You don't have to save up all the money
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:45.180]   to go roller skating 10 years from now.
[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.380]   As a matter of fact,
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:47.940]   daughter's probably not gonna go roller skating
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:48.780]   with you 10 years from now.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.260]   She's gotta have her own life and her own thing.
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:52.580]   So let's optimize for that thing that fulfills you.
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.900]   You can build a model spreadsheet
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.660]   for kind of like the average person,
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:58.380]   which there's no such thing as the average person,
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:01.180]   but it's very like, this is me.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:03.340]   I've built out this spreadsheet.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:05.460]   And I think the beauty of that spreadsheet
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:08.100]   that somebody builds out is not the actual formulas
[01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.300]   that I'll be able to copy and paste to my life,
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.460]   but the methodology of their thinking.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:15.180]   It's the model that is the most powerful thing.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:16.780]   You want the method of thinking like,
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:18.940]   how do I think about this problem?
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:20.540]   What variables do I consider?
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:23.340]   - I think the thing we might be able to build pretty easily.
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:26.420]   So in the Wealthfront app, there's this idea of an FU number.
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:28.180]   We call it the financial utopia number.
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:30.060]   But the idea is once you have this amount of money,
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:31.940]   you could stop working.
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:35.100]   And the number that I want to build a simple calculator for
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.580]   is kind of like the pension number,
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:39.940]   where it's like, once you've started saving X,
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:44.940]   you've solved for the money you need to live in retirement.
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.580]   It's not about stopping working.
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.540]   It's about starting to realize
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:52.340]   you now have crossed over a threshold of being on track
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.460]   to pay for life in retirement, basic needs,
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.380]   that you're now at a point
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.820]   where you can start to allocate your excess.
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:00.460]   You could allocate it now, you could allocate it
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:03.660]   in the future, but I imagine that for many people,
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.340]   getting to the point that they're like,
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.740]   just maxing out their 401k gets them to that point.
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.820]   Like if you max out your 401k for your whole life,
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:11.780]   and I haven't done the math,
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:16.780]   but maybe you have solved for retirement basic needs.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.220]   And now you're at a point that you can figure out
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:20.900]   what to do with all of your excess each month.
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:22.820]   Sure, you could save it so you can spend it in your 50s.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:23.860]   You can spend it in your 30s.
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.820]   You could spend it in your 70s,
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:27.500]   but at least coming up with a framework
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.740]   to help people understand.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.420]   Because in the Wealthfront app, we say, okay,
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.460]   this is your financial utopia number, your FU number,
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:35.700]   but it might be $5 million because if you're 30,
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.220]   it's the amount of money you need today
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:40.660]   to never work again and keep spending what you spend today.
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.660]   But I don't know if that's helpful.
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:43.860]   I think it'd be more helpful to have a number
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:48.300]   that is here is how much money you need to have saved
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.940]   to have retirement solved.
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.260]   And now all the excess that you save each month,
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:53.100]   you could spend.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.260]   That simple thing might be universal.
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:56.500]   Obviously it would need variables
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.260]   of how much you need to spend in retirement.
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.860]   - I think it helps get the concept across.
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:02.620]   I would say that it's not optimal,
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:05.460]   the front load you're saving for retirement,
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:07.580]   and then go say the rest of the money I make
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:09.020]   is for goofing off and allocating it.
[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.740]   I think getting the concept across
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:11.900]   and people freeing their mind,
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:14.300]   I'm like, holy shit, this money is for fun.
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.580]   And when do I wanna have fun?
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:16.780]   And I'm gonna allocate the fun
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:17.980]   at the right times in my life.
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:18.820]   It's powerful.
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.500]   What I would say is that you don't work two years
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.500]   for retirement and then start spending spun.
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:26.060]   You work some for retirement and some goes to fund,
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:28.740]   some goes to fund, and it gets there at a certain point,
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:31.220]   particularly because of time bucketing
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:33.300]   and the fact that certain experiences belong then.
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.020]   And if you take that money,
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:38.260]   and if you don't have that experience in this time period,
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:40.300]   you never have that experience.
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:43.940]   And that leads to future regret and less fulfillment.
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.300]   And so it is not optimal, the front load retirement.
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.140]   May solve some sort of fear in you,
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:50.420]   but to get the concept across,
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:52.260]   I think most of your audience is like,
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:54.020]   they really have retirement covered, right?
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.820]   They really have their survival number covered.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:57.940]   So if they could separate that out,
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:59.540]   maybe some of the young people don't,
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.180]   but if you can separate that out and think,
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:02.940]   okay, I'm putting this into a retirement bucket.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:04.580]   I'm on track to hit retirement.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:06.540]   How do I spend my fun money?
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:08.100]   And how do I allocate that throughout my life?
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:09.500]   I think it's better than nothing
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.580]   'cause it's mainly getting that concept across.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.180]   It's the way of thinking.
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:14.100]   I want it to sink in.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:18.100]   I wrote the book not as like some sort of economics book
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.980]   or physics book or calculus book.
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.860]   The reason why the book has stories in it
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:25.020]   is because you have to get past people's habits and egos.
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.620]   There's a reason why the book starts out with a death,
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:29.020]   a premature death.
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:31.980]   It's because immediately your ego disappears
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:33.940]   and you think, yeah, I'm going to die.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.500]   How am I gonna allocate the hours of my life?
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:36.420]   How am I gonna spend the money?
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:37.780]   Even though my life is longer,
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:41.060]   and this guy's was two years, we have the same problem.
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:43.300]   And the reason why we go over objections
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.180]   is to get it in a way to get past your ego,
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.180]   the habits that you're formed
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:50.180]   so that you actually execute on these ideas,
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:52.940]   build on these ideas to have a more fulfilling life.
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:54.300]   You probably heard me say it,
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:56.300]   I'm out here trying to save people's lives.
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:58.820]   And a lot of times people are like,
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:00.260]   the fuck are you talking about, Perkins,
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:01.100]   save people's lives?
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:04.140]   You wrote a goddamn book about optimizing
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:04.980]   and net fulfillment.
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:08.100]   And I use this example of, listen,
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.660]   when you pull somebody drowning in a pool,
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.380]   they're drowning and you pull them out,
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:14.380]   you give them mouth to mouth
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.340]   and get the water out or whatever.
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:19.460]   And they're like, oh my God, you saved my life.
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:20.740]   I'm like, guess what?
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:22.460]   They're still gonna fucking die.
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:24.740]   They're just not gonna die that day.
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:28.540]   They're still going to die, 100%.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:30.340]   So what have you given them?
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:33.900]   You've given them more choices, more time,
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.300]   more experience, more I love yous,
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.580]   more going to the opera,
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.300]   more hanging out with their grandmother.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.540]   You've given them more of their life,
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:43.860]   more experience to have and then they ultimately die.
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.700]   And so with this book,
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:47.820]   when I get you to optimize for net fulfillment,
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:51.140]   I'm giving you more choices, more trips with grandma,
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:54.820]   more going to the opera, more charities, more ski trips.
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:55.740]   It's the same thing.
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:56.940]   It's the same thing.
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:58.300]   In my mind, I'm just gonna go with that.
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:01.820]   So I'm like a fanatic when it comes to this
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.580]   because I truly believe that
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:05.500]   when you optimize your life that much,
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.340]   just the same way you optimize by saving,
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:09.100]   you get more trips and more life,
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.500]   that I'm saving people's lives.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.460]   - I've started putting some of this into place.
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:15.860]   My wife and I actually had a conversation about money.
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:18.100]   My wife was like, oh, we should try to hit this goal.
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:19.100]   And then I was like, no, no, no.
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:20.700]   I've been reading this book.
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.060]   Why are we even trying to hit a higher goal?
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:23.340]   What is it even for?
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:24.180]   And now we're like, no,
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:26.540]   we actually have a new net worth goal and it's down.
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.980]   - Yeah, it might be.
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.620]   That conversation is a great one to have
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.020]   because she might pull something out
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:33.820]   because this is the trip I wanna go on.
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.460]   And it's like this big expensive thing
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:38.900]   or I wanna fly around in a G650 or whatever it is.
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:39.740]   You'd be like, okay,
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:44.020]   at least we've attached what we're working for.
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:48.340]   A lot of people forget what they're working for.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:49.260]   If you ask them,
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:52.860]   they'll just regurgitate the autopilot answer.
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.100]   To get more money to the thing or whatever,
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:57.380]   because it's like, no, stop, stop, stop.
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:59.220]   You're going to work and they're gonna give you money.
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:00.340]   What's the money for?
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:01.500]   Why do you need more money?
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:05.780]   What can you not afford that you need to work for
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:07.340]   in order to consume?
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.740]   And then we have a real conversation.
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:11.220]   - She would be the first to admit
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:14.020]   she was just on this path of accumulate, accumulate.
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:15.900]   She hadn't taken the pause to think about it.
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.420]   - And then when we did,
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.900]   it clicked and the conversation was totally different.
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:20.820]   I still think we need to figure out
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:23.300]   what we wanna do with money and savings and spending
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.620]   and when we wanna do it.
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:26.980]   But I think we've both now been like,
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:30.020]   we're off the, let's just rack up money.
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.340]   That is no longer a goal.
[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:32.180]   So thank you.
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:33.020]   - I'm gonna hit a point
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:34.660]   because a lot of people are probably thinking,
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.020]   well, there's nothing I wanna do.
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:37.180]   They're listening to this and they're like,
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.460]   I don't wanna do anything else.
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:41.260]   And the reason why you don't wanna do anything else
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.980]   is because you've been a rat on a wheel.
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.780]   You haven't been exercising those muscles.
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.380]   You don't know how to play anymore.
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:48.420]   You forgot.
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:49.620]   You do wanna do things.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:51.620]   They're just buried so deep
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.540]   under all these routines you built to acquiring money.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.580]   And those muscles are so atrophied.
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:58.380]   It's like you haven't gone to the gym for five years.
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:00.700]   You can come in and you try and lift 225 pounds.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:01.540]   It's not happening.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:02.660]   You need to build up into it.
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.060]   You need to start small and be like,
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.060]   okay, let me think about these things I wanna do.
[01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:08.180]   Do I really like that?
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:09.260]   Let me just go out and discover
[01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:10.220]   because life is discovery.
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:12.220]   You don't necessarily know everything you wanna do.
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:13.860]   You have to go out and be exposed to it.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:15.660]   But you have only been exposed to work
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:17.740]   and making more money and climbing the career ladder
[01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:20.460]   and doing more deals and solving this puzzle
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.460]   that you've been solving that you've been addicted for.
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:25.060]   And you haven't been working on the what fulfills me?
[01:20:25.060 --> 01:20:26.140]   What trips do I like?
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.420]   What experience do I have?
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:29.020]   How would I spend money if I had it?
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:31.380]   You don't even think about those things.
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:33.220]   And so it takes time.
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.380]   Don't be discouraged.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:38.980]   You're not going to just show up in the gym once
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:40.300]   and get in shape overnight.
[01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:41.740]   You're not gonna just quit your job
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:43.460]   and know exactly what you wanna do overnight.
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:46.340]   You have to build yourself back up.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:49.220]   You have to get back in touch and don't get discouraged.
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:51.620]   If I quit completely doing training
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.380]   and I think about this all the time,
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:55.380]   wow, I got a lot of time.
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.620]   I don't know what to do.
[01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:58.740]   And you get this panic, oh, I gotta go back to work.
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:00.340]   You just got thrown into the water
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:01.460]   and you forgot how to swim.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:03.660]   You're like, calm down, float for a little bit.
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.300]   Do a little stroke, you'll get there.
[01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:07.020]   Then you'll have the more fulfilling life.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:07.860]   - Awesome.
[01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:09.580]   And a couple of random things totally separate
[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:11.260]   that I think maybe tie in, maybe don't.
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.100]   - Okay.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:12.940]   - Before we wrap.
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.180]   I wanna just get your take.
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:15.020]   You're an optimizer.
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:17.380]   You wrote a book about optimizing, me too.
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:18.620]   Talk me through a few things
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:20.140]   that I just need someone like you
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.820]   to tell me why I'm being crazy.
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:24.580]   I think one of the challenges I have with both money
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:26.180]   and you made a joke about a person
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.340]   that's accumulated millions of miles, that's me.
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:30.660]   And one of my challenges with using money,
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:32.380]   miles, currency, anything,
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:37.380]   is that I'm aware of how much more optimal it could be used.
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:40.220]   I know that if I really find the right trip,
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:43.140]   500,000 miles will take the whole family around the world.
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:45.220]   But if I book it today for the thing I want,
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:46.940]   it's a million and I struggle.
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:49.420]   Or we were talking about the holidays this year.
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:51.940]   We're like, we have time off, we don't have plans,
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.940]   but wow, it's four times more expensive
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:56.700]   to go on any vacation at the end of December
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.900]   than it is in January.
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:21:59.220]   We don't have the time off in January,
[01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:00.940]   so we're not actually gonna do that.
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:03.420]   But in my mind, it's like punt
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:06.540]   'cause it's an inoptimal use of that money.
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:08.660]   - My main thing for you is you're solving
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:10.300]   for max flyer miles
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:12.460]   and you're not solving for max fulfillment.
[01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:13.300]   - Yeah.
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.220]   - And so what you don't realize
[01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:18.340]   is that max fulfillment for you costs this much
[01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:20.100]   and that's just the cost.
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.620]   So there's a time period where it belongs
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:24.740]   and this is the optimal time for it to happen
[01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:25.940]   and this is the purchase price.
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.900]   And you're like, but I can do the trip
[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:31.940]   at a suboptimal time at less fulfillment for 500,000 miles.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:34.060]   And I'm like, you can do that,
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:37.140]   but realize that you're solving for spending less miles
[01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:39.780]   and not solving for max fulfillment.
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:40.700]   If you're the type of guy
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:42.060]   that when you look back on your death bed,
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:44.780]   you'd be like, wow, I saved all these goddamn miles
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:48.460]   as opposed to, holy shit, I fucked up my fulfillment
[01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:50.660]   in this time period when my kids were this age,
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:52.260]   when it was time for me to doing this
[01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:53.700]   and I misallocated my time,
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:55.700]   then go ahead and solve for miles.
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:57.020]   - Or money in that case also.
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.780]   - Yeah, money, miles, whatever it is you're solving for,
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:00.020]   you're optimizing for miles.
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:02.700]   And I'm like, listen, fulfillment first, miles second.
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.180]   There's gonna be some blend,
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.700]   but the maximum fulfillment is what we're solving for.
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:09.780]   And so sometimes you're gonna have to vaporize the miles
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:10.740]   'cause that's what it costs.
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:14.500]   And then lo and behold, the airlines know this.
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:18.100]   They know that in Western culture, these holidays,
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.940]   this is when people want to fulfill their lives, et cetera,
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:23.140]   so we get to charge more for fulfillment.
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:25.780]   And when kids are in finals, et cetera,
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:28.620]   there's no family trips, et cetera, so we can charge less.
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:29.460]   They know this.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:32.860]   This is the cost of fulfillment, everything costs.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:34.620]   And you're like, no, no, no, no,
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:36.020]   I wanna just have the lowest cost.
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:38.780]   And I'm like, no, I wanna have the highest fulfillment.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.500]   So if you get back on,
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.220]   I'm solving for max fulfillment with my family,
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:45.700]   I think you'll become less detached
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.420]   on the value of the conversion of the points
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.580]   for certain activities.
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:52.380]   - Maybe the answer is, sit down and say, look,
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:53.500]   we have two choices.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.900]   And in the next X hours, days, whatever,
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:57.060]   we're gonna pick one.
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:58.980]   Either we actually do commit
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:02.140]   and we go book the trip in January when it's better.
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:03.300]   I'm not saying punt years.
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:04.660]   I'm saying either you say, look,
[01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:06.180]   we're just gonna find a way to make it work
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:07.260]   at a lower price,
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:11.100]   or we're just gonna pay the price to go when it's convenient
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:13.780]   but not let ourselves escape the decision.
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:15.100]   I think that's the thing.
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.340]   It's like you either pay up
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:17.900]   because you want the fulfillment
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:21.220]   or you adjust life to make it work at a better price
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:24.540]   as long as you don't not take the experience.
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:27.220]   - To me, it's like trip here, trip here, trip here,
[01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:28.300]   trip here, trip here.
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:29.660]   What is the most fulfilling?
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.860]   Is it worth it?
[01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:32.380]   What is gives me the net fulfillment?
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:33.540]   It might be not the January.
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:36.420]   It might be trip here and another trip and two trips.
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:39.060]   And since they're in the same time bucket,
[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:40.380]   that's actually more fulfillment.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:41.860]   Two different environments, et cetera.
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:42.980]   There's gonna be a lot of variables.
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:44.340]   Like we'd get off the chalkboard.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.620]   I'd go over with you and I'm like,
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:46.860]   all right, you're really gonna take two trips?
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:48.060]   Yeah, I'm really gonna take two trips.
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:49.940]   And that's a million miles for two trips,
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:51.700]   but it's not over Christmas.
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:53.540]   How do you feel about the fulfillment score?
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:55.060]   Let's put a fulfillment score on each trip.
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:57.460]   Okay, it seems to add up more than the trip over Christmas.
[01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:58.660]   Are we sure about that?
[01:24:58.660 --> 01:24:59.660]   Yeah, we're sure about that.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:00.700]   We're not sure about that.
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:02.780]   We'd go through this whole exercise
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:04.500]   with your wife and talk about it.
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.340]   And then we'd come to a decision
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:08.740]   and then we would make the right decision
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:12.820]   knowing that we solve for net fulfillment, not miles.
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.340]   The miles was an input.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:15.900]   It's like wealth, health and time, right?
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:18.060]   So miles is kind of in the wealth bucket.
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.660]   That was an input to solve for net fulfillment.
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:22.900]   And we slid it back and forth in time.
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:24.140]   Like, all right, two trips.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:27.100]   Two trips, not Christmas actually is better.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:29.460]   We'll hang out at home and play board games
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:30.820]   and then go on two trips.
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:32.940]   I look forward to sending you a note saying,
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:36.380]   we took the trip or the two trips or the three trips.
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:38.260]   Whatever it works out to be or a trip and a half
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:39.580]   or a trip plus an upgrade.
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:42.380]   These are the things that I don't have the right answer
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:43.660]   because the inputs matter the most,
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:44.980]   but like the mental model is there.
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:46.340]   Like you're thinking about it.
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:48.220]   The other thing I wanna touch on is health.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:51.260]   So it seems like one of the biggest opportunities
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:54.140]   to unlock a lot of this equation
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:55.900]   is to be healthier, live longer.
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:58.220]   You talked about how in Japan people are just
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:00.900]   as a society that, I know you've spent a lot of time
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:03.140]   with some of these great doctors.
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.700]   Are there things that someone listening
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:07.580]   who doesn't get a chance to talk to Peter or Tia
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:09.260]   or something on a regular basis,
[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:10.380]   is there stuff you've learned,
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:13.620]   whether it's tests to consider doing now
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:16.420]   or ways you've changed your diet or your health
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:20.620]   that people could do to improve or extend the time
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:22.100]   that they can do more active things
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:24.540]   and I guess live longer or?
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:27.100]   - I think I pay a lot for the last 15%.
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.420]   Like 85%, even the fanciest doctors,
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:30.700]   it's all low hanging fruit.
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:32.180]   And the lowest hanging fruit is like,
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:35.340]   hey, do an activity that makes you sweat
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:37.820]   for four hours a week, maintain your weight,
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:39.780]   try not to consume added sugar,
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:41.940]   reduce all your sugars in your sugar intake,
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:43.220]   no alcohol, don't smoke.
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:45.660]   Like the super low hanging fruit
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:48.780]   about not being overweight, staying in shape,
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:52.020]   not consuming added sugars, like sugar is the worst,
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:53.900]   and exercise, even if it's hiking
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:56.380]   or walking three miles a day or three miles,
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:59.260]   four times a week or something like that,
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:01.340]   that's amazing low hanging fruit
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:05.100]   to make your current experiences better
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.660]   and your future experiences better.
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:09.980]   Because activity by health is the fulfillment
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:11.140]   and if your health is shitty,
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:12.540]   either you don't get to do the activity
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:14.060]   or the activity is not as enjoyable.
[01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:16.380]   I used to walk like seven to 12 miles around Paris
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:18.700]   when I was there, just with a backpack on.
[01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:22.620]   Now I can maybe do six or five before I'm like,
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.380]   my knees kinda hurt, I don't like it anymore.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.180]   So I got more of Paris.
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:29.300]   On a trip for the same dollar than I do now.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.380]   And the more in shape I am, the less overweight I am,
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.620]   the less weight I'm carrying
[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:34.940]   and force I'm hitting into my knees,
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:36.820]   the more enjoyable every single activity is.
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:39.220]   I would argue and say to people like,
[01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:42.100]   that low hanging fruit has such a huge yield
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:43.820]   on your fulfillment.
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:46.260]   Whether you're gonna be able to enjoy playing
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:48.580]   with your kids or relatives or be around
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:51.180]   or even enjoy getting on a plane, et cetera,
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:53.700]   later on in life is highly correlated
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:56.780]   and highly dependent on the state of your health right now.
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:57.900]   I can't emphasize it enough.
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:58.740]   It's not a health book.
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.580]   I'm like, listen, there are tons of book,
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:04.460]   podcasts, motivational speakers, et cetera,
[01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:06.740]   on like how to be healthy.
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:09.820]   And I just say, this vertical is uber important.
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.420]   Make sure you're addressed it.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:15.140]   Try and do activities that fulfill you
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:16.740]   irrespective of the health benefits.
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.240]   And one of the ones I found is hiking.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:19.380]   Like going hiking with a friend,
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:21.900]   I get a great experience talking with them,
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:25.060]   seeing nature, discovering what's around me.
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:26.860]   And it's also has these health benefits,
[01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:30.260]   cardio benefits, strength, legs, et cetera,
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:31.940]   that make future experiences better.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:33.300]   So I get a double whammy.
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:34.140]   - Yeah.
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:36.700]   - Not overeating, not doing X, Y, and Z.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:39.500]   Try and develop the habits that lead you to the goal
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.940]   'cause your motivation goes up and down.
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.860]   So develop these habits.
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:45.300]   Get rid of the snacks, make 'em move far away.
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:46.460]   Don't even buy 'em.
[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:47.500]   Then you can't get to 'em.
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.660]   - You said, if you're looking at a cookie,
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:52.300]   just be like, is this cookie worth an hour on the treadmill?
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:53.140]   - That's the way I do it.
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.560]   I convert all these things into like time.
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.300]   Some resources that I'm fighting for,
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:58.300]   which I think at the end of the day,
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:28:59.260]   everybody's fighting for.
[01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:00.220]   They want free time.
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:01.460]   They want time to do what they want.
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:02.940]   They want more time on the planet.
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:05.020]   And so, if I'm trying to maintain my health
[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:07.340]   and my weight is very important to my future enjoyment,
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:09.180]   my knees, et cetera, like,
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:11.580]   is that cookie worth an hour on the treadmill?
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:14.620]   Sometimes a cookie is actually worth an hour on a treadmill.
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:16.380]   If it's a nice, good chocolate chip cookie,
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.300]   I will go on the treadmill for these cookies.
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:20.220]   And sometimes it's, nope.
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:21.060]   (laughs)
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:22.940]   - What if I push you since you said you'd answer anything,
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:25.620]   like to peel back some of that 15%
[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:28.020]   that you've learned that I might not know?
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.940]   - I think diagnostics is the key.
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:32.980]   Many diseases, ailments, and their progression
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:35.020]   are thwarted if you find them earlier enough.
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:36.740]   Some of the cancers that are like always fatal,
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:39.340]   if they had a test for it and they found it early,
[01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:40.300]   you'd survive.
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:42.100]   Heart diagnostics, MRI diagnostics.
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:42.940]   Somebody once said to me,
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:47.940]   "You should be spending 10% of your income on your health."
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:50.220]   I was like, that's fucking crazy.
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:51.420]   I have a pretty high income.
[01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:53.140]   Then I thought about it and I was like,
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:55.300]   no, that includes like diet,
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:57.820]   whether I buy pre-packaged meals or have a chef,
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:01.900]   that includes doctors, diagnosis, et cetera, health plans.
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:04.140]   And I was like, it's actually low.
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:04.980]   - Yeah.
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:05.820]   - It's actually low.
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:06.660]   It's so important.
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:10.420]   And so, a lot of the secret sauce of these doctors is,
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:11.740]   you know, every quarter they come in
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:14.420]   and they draw like 32, 36 vials of blood.
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:15.700]   This is your mineral absorption.
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:16.540]   This is so-and-so.
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:18.220]   This is what your thyroid is doing.
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:19.060]   And this is whatever.
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:19.940]   And here's all the metrics.
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:21.360]   And you're kind of out over here.
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:24.140]   Like you need to do Edware and here's your cholesterol.
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:27.060]   And these things, that preventative,
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:29.240]   ounce of paraphernalia is worth a pound of cura.
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.240]   That is the key.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.080]   - Yeah.
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.020]   - And the prescription of like,
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:33.980]   you need to be doing more cardio or you need to do this,
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.420]   or you should be avoiding these foods
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:37.100]   because they inflame you.
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:38.260]   And inflammation is death.
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:41.040]   So, diagnostics, diagnostics.
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:43.540]   - One of the companies that I partner with on the show
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:44.880]   is called Inside Tracker.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:49.420]   And they do 43 biomarker paired with genetic testing
[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:51.880]   to give you an analysis of both like,
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.500]   different biomarkers and what that means,
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.540]   what your optimal range is adjusted for your genetics,
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:58.140]   and like what your inner age is,
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:00.020]   which is like looking at all the biomarkers
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.220]   of where you should be.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:02.660]   Are you like ahead or behind?
[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:05.580]   So, that's one thing that's a little more accessible.
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:08.640]   I know there's some GRAIL tests for early cancer detection.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:12.180]   I know there's PRENUVO, which is like the full body MRI.
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:14.220]   So, I'll punt on pushing on the 15%.
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:16.980]   And I'm just gonna go find a doctor who I've met,
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:18.340]   and we're gonna go deeper on this.
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:20.740]   - Yeah, you do the MRI, you look at your telomeres,
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:23.820]   they're like, "Oh, you can do a hyperbaric chamber."
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:25.420]   Like one of the things you can do
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:26.900]   that is out of Israeli studies,
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:30.020]   I'll go into one of the cutting edge,
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:32.060]   but pain in the ass things, okay?
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:33.740]   That I actually stopped doing.
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:35.540]   You can go to hyperbaric chamber for two hours,
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:37.380]   and in theory, it lengthens your telomeres,
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:39.380]   it makes you younger at the cellular level.
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:40.200]   - Wow.
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.140]   - Which means in theory, you know,
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:41.980]   you're gonna live longer
[01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:43.900]   'cause your organs are not gonna break down at the time,
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:44.740]   they're gonna break down,
[01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:46.540]   you're gonna get some extension on your telomeres.
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:50.100]   And it has all these other therapeutic supposed properties.
[01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:54.700]   So, I'd have to go drive an hour to the hyperbaric chamber.
[01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:57.020]   I was gonna run the same experiment that the Israelis did.
[01:31:57.020 --> 01:32:00.940]   So, you have to do X months of hyperbaric chambers,
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:02.740]   whatever it is, it's a lot.
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:07.180]   But the place I had to go to was an hour away.
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:09.700]   You go dive down, you dive to pressure.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:11.380]   So, it takes a while to get to pressure.
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:12.860]   Then you stay at pressure for an hour
[01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:14.020]   or whatever the timeframe is,
[01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:15.380]   and then you have to come out.
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:17.480]   And then I gotta drive an hour back.
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:21.900]   And I was like, okay, I'm going to get X benefit
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:23.620]   and live longer this timeframe,
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:26.620]   but I'm wasting three to four hours a day
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:29.620]   traveling to this hyperbaric chamber back and forth.
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:31.660]   And I was just like, nope, not worth it.
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:32.500]   I'll die earlier.
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:33.340]   You know what I mean?
[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:35.060]   I'll die a year earlier or whatever it is.
[01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:37.340]   Time is too valuable to me right now in this time bucket.
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:39.220]   So, that's one, hyperbaric chambers.
[01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.100]   - But might not be worth it.
[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:40.940]   - No, it's not be worth it.
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:42.780]   I mean, if I had a hyperbaric chamber in my house
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.340]   and I could just do it when I sleep,
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:45.980]   I'd be like, I would 100% do it.
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:48.020]   But that commute to the facility
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.180]   was just absolutely crushing me.
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:53.440]   - Yeah, I feel that way about cold plunge and sauna
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.540]   to the extent that it's like,
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:56.220]   I should just get one and put it outside.
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:59.180]   - The sauna, there's data on the health benefits.
[01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:00.600]   The cold, the studies aren't there.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.440]   There may be benefits
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.820]   and people are raving about the benefits,
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:04.540]   but the research isn't there.
[01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:07.640]   A sauna definitely confers health benefits,
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:09.980]   longevity, less chance of a heart attack,
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:11.740]   yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda.
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:13.260]   The sauna's a hack.
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:15.740]   There's all these like other hacks that are out there.
[01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:16.580]   - That's the show.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:19.420]   So, I'm gonna totally hack the sauna.
[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:21.100]   Hyperbaric chamber might not be worth it,
[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:22.140]   but it's out there.
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:25.900]   Full diagnostics, MRIs, those 3D colon scanners
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:28.380]   where they actually scan your whole body.
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:31.540]   There's latest and greatest imaging technology, et cetera,
[01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.600]   where they're gonna scan you and be like,
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.700]   oh, you got too much visceral fat, you got this.
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:37.100]   I remember when I went there and they were like,
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:37.940]   do you smoke?
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:38.760]   And I was like, no.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.300]   He's like, yeah, I can tell when I look at your liver.
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:41.260]   I can tell what you do.
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:45.900]   They can tell my habits based on looking at my insides.
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:46.740]   - Wow.
[01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:48.140]   - And I was like, okay, I like this.
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:51.060]   - I just wrote a newsletter about FSAs and HSAs.
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:54.020]   So, one cool hack to compound it
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:56.220]   is you could put pre-tax money in from your employer
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:58.480]   and then use that for some of these health things
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:33:59.820]   that aren't covered by insurance.
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:04.820]   We've done that for LASIK, for IVF, for blood tests,
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:05.780]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:08.020]   But the last thing I wanna jump on
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:09.540]   is every time I talk to someone,
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:11.340]   I let them pick a place
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:13.460]   that they're pretty familiar with in the world
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:15.580]   and tell people that are headed there
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:16.700]   how to have a great day there,
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:19.080]   whether it's doing, drinking, dining, anything.
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:20.140]   So, pick a place.
[01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:21.500]   - I'm gonna pick St. Barts.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:24.020]   So, one, get prepared to spend money.
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:25.200]   Not a cheap island.
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.040]   You can do it cheap.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.620]   I'm sure you'll hack away and find the great Airbnb
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:30.420]   on a discount, on a so-and-so,
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:31.580]   or be a room reviewer
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:33.140]   or something like that gets you down there cheap.
[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:34.700]   But let's say you get down there.
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:38.340]   St. Barts is what I think the perfect match
[01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:41.640]   of beauty and environment and commerce and fun.
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:46.340]   I would recommend either staying on Fleman's Beach,
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:49.620]   Fleman, or Grand Cul-de-Sac, like Bartholomew,
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:50.860]   or at the Eden Rocks.
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:52.060]   The main thing is the food.
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:55.700]   So, you wanna go get yourself a little Moke car
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:58.980]   or something that's a convertible when you rent a car,
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:01.220]   and make sure you drive around the island.
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.940]   It's not that far to drive around the island.
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:05.520]   You can drive a little bit and check out little areas.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:08.440]   You wanna go to visit all the beaches.
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:12.080]   I think Governor Beach is probably the best beach
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:14.600]   in the world, or one of the best beaches in the world.
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:17.260]   But I also enjoy St. Lean Beach, Grand Cul-de-Sac,
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:18.480]   all these places.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:20.600]   Eating along the beach and just checking the vibe
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.520]   and hanging out is amazing.
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.300]   At Shell Beach, there's a restaurant there.
[01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:25.680]   You definitely wanna have lunch there.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:28.440]   There's Le Tamarin, which is like kinda in this garden.
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.260]   At night, you definitely wanna eat there.
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.660]   I would say more for dinner than the lunch.
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:35.940]   There's always gonna be a party somewhere, someplace.
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:38.800]   So, in Gustavia, walking around and shopping,
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.460]   there's Nikki Beach, there's the hotels,
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:45.260]   there's kite surfing, there's lounging.
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:47.400]   I would say definitely visit the other hotels
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.360]   and have lunch on the beach.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:50.300]   Like, that's good places.
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:51.920]   And then go check out the little shops.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.920]   A lot of it is vibing and hiking and driving around
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:59.220]   and just finding little places
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:02.100]   and enjoying the nexus of the French culture.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:03.620]   Because the French are known for being rude,
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:06.300]   but in St. Barts, it's the nicest of the French.
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:08.860]   It's competitive to come work there and come be there.
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:11.700]   So, you don't get the rude French, you get the nice French.
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:14.740]   And you get French cuisine, which is amazing.
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:15.580]   It's very good.
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:19.380]   And you get a beautiful island and crystal clear water
[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:22.220]   and great beaches and windsurfing and paddle surfing
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:25.220]   and swimming with turtles and things like that.
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:26.040]   And then you get to drive.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:27.620]   This island has different climates
[01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:30.580]   where it has a dry side and a wet side.
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:33.660]   And there's all kinds of little experiences
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:35.980]   you can have in the island life way.
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:36.820]   - I'm ready to go.
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:38.060]   (laughing)
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:40.740]   - It's developed enough, but not overdeveloped.
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:42.380]   That's what I would say.
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.140]   And that's the beauty of St. Barts.
[01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:45.780]   And it's clean and it's safe.
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:46.620]   - Sounds fantastic.
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:49.260]   - The biggest drawback to St. Barts is it's expensive.
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:51.500]   - Well, there's a time for expensive trips.
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:52.340]   Save for it.
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:53.160]   - There is a time.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:54.000]   - Budget it.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:54.820]   Spend the money on the trip.
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:55.660]   Don't die with it.
[01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:56.620]   I think that's my takeaway.
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:57.860]   - Yeah, that's your takeaway.
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:00.020]   - Any parting advice or places people should head
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:01.900]   to check you out where you're working online?
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.540]   - I use Instagram and Instagram stories
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:05.160]   as kind of like my own life diary.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:06.220]   Going back to that hack,
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:07.700]   how can you use the memory dividend?
[01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:09.660]   I use my stories as my memory dividend.
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:12.140]   They save to my phone and get backed up to Google Cloud.
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:14.940]   And then, you know, it will show like on this day
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:16.640]   and I'll have all these little snippets and videos
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:19.040]   of like what happened on this trip or what I did.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:21.100]   So I am Bill Perkins on Instagram.
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:22.500]   You can follow me.
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:25.420]   Sometimes it's just me and my cat doing nothing exciting,
[01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:27.060]   but sometimes it's exciting.
[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:28.980]   If you want hot takes or chaos,
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:32.340]   you can follow me on Twitter, @bp22 on Twitter.
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:33.300]   I don't recommend it.
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:34.600]   Sometimes it's markets.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.220]   Sometimes it's finance advice.
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:38.460]   Sometimes it's hot political takes.
[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:40.740]   I'm a libertarian, so everybody hates me.
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:42.620]   Left, the right.
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:44.060]   Sometimes it's just goofing off.
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:45.140]   If you're in for the chaos.
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:47.160]   It's a format that I like where I can actually interact
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.980]   with people enough and talk to them, et cetera.
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:51.700]   So I love Twitter too much.
[01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:53.220]   - But diewithzerobook.com.
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:54.500]   - Oh, diewithzerobook.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.680]   We're all where books are sold everywhere.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:57.940]   It's on audio book.
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:37:59.060]   You can listen to it.
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:01.620]   You can read it everywhere, diewithzerobook.com.
[01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:02.460]   You can go there.
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.340]   It'll list the languages that it's sold.
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:05.300]   So it's in Spanish.
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:06.260]   It's in Polish.
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:07.700]   It's in Chinese.
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:09.160]   It's in German.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.080]   It's in Japanese.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.480]   And actually the book is most successful in Japan.
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:14.320]   - That's awesome.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.140]   - The book is everywhere.
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:16.180]   That's what I mean to say.
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:17.020]   - I have the book.
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:18.220]   I recommend the book.
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:19.620]   It's had a huge impact on me.
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:20.700]   Thanks for writing it.
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:21.860]   Thank you for being here.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:23.140]   - I'm glad to be here.
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:24.400]   Thanks for hearing me blather.
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.700]   I'm always down to blather again if you want.
[01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:30.180]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:31.940]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:33.440]   If you haven't already left a rating
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:36.860]   and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:38.580]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.020]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:42.380]   questions for me, or just want to say hi,
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:46.660]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:47.740]   That's it for this week.
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:48.940]   I'll see you next week.
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:51.520]   (upbeat music)
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:54.860]   (electronic beeping)
[01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:57.940]   (electronic buzzing)
[01:38:57.940 --> 01:39:00.680]   (birds chirping)
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:10.680]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
