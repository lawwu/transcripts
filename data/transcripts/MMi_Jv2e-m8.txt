[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.280]   - An email question comes in to us from the West Coast.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.920]   Hello, Pastor John, my name is Nathan,
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm a college student in the Bay Area, California.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.400]   In my first year of college, I found your sermons
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.600]   and books quite helpful on the journey for joy.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.280]   Thinking back to your early days at Wheaton College
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.880]   and your annual involvement at the Passion Conferences,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.180]   what advice would you give to a college student today?
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.120]   - Well, I wrote down, I jotted down notes
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.040]   on seven pieces of advice,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.280]   and there could have been a lot more,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.680]   but I know these podcasts are supposed to be manageable.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.000]   Number one, love God with all your heart and soul
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.360]   and mind and strength.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.560]   It is the first and the great commandment.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.560]   That is, use your mind, your college-educated mind,
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.520]   to feed the fires of the heart with the fuel of truth.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.740]   Let everything you study function
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.040]   as a means of inflaming the heart.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.960]   Put all your intellectual and physical effort
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.560]   into guarding and fueling your heart.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.560]   Never give in to the emotionalism, which neglects thinking,
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.400]   or the intellectualism, which neglects the heart.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.680]   Loving God with the heart is the great essence
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.760]   of why the universe was created.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.400]   Treasuring God over all things.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.640]   That's what loving God means.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.920]   The mind and the body, when it says love God
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.840]   with all the heart and the mind and the body,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.800]   the mind and the body are the servants of the heart.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.520]   And then the passions of the heart become visible
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.280]   through the mind and the body.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.120]   That's number one.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.160]   Number two, the second commandment is like it.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.200]   You should love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.320]   Be a servant in college,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.960]   not a self-preoccupied, self-exalting egoist.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.080]   If you wanna be happy, want others to be happy as much.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.240]   That's what love your neighbor as yourself means.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.640]   If you want to make good grades,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.920]   want others to make good grades.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.160]   If you need help with math, give Jim,
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.960]   give Jill help with English.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.360]   If you want to be in a home for Thanksgiving,
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.320]   help someone else be in a home for Thanksgiving.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.720]   Loving your neighbor as you love yourself
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.880]   doesn't start after college.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.880]   Number three, be saturated with the Bible.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.680]   10 minutes a day will not cut it in this world.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.920]   This is the very word of God.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.920]   Read it, meditate on it, memorize large portions of it.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.000]   I didn't hear anyone recite from memory a paragraph
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.880]   of the Bible until I was 28 years old.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.080]   I only heard verses, never.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.760]   28 years in the church, I never heard a paragraph
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.080]   of the Bible recited from memory
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.160]   and the effect it had on me.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.160]   When Art Lewis recited Matthew 6, 25 to 33,
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.760]   was paradigm changing in my life.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.680]   Memorized chapters of the Bible are important.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.400]   Memorize chapters, memorize whole books,
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.480]   memorize the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.160]   memorize particular Psalms.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.160]   I doubt that anyone will be an effective Christian
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.200]   standing against the culture and for the culture
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.240]   in our day without much Bible memory.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.520]   Number four, be done with all vainglory,
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.680]   self-sufficiency, self-reliance,
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   and cast yourself daily on the help of the Lord
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.320]   to help you with everything, everything.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.080]   Jesus said, "Without me, you can do nothing."
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.920]   Nothing.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.400]   Believe that, believe that.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.120]   Make it part of who you are.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.560]   I can do nothing without Jesus.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.480]   And then turn to Proverbs 3,
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.840]   trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.560]   Don't rely on your own understanding.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.880]   In all your ways, every one of them,
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.640]   every hour, every minute, in all your ways,
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.200]   acknowledge Him, heal, make your paths straight.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.480]   So turn every hour to God afresh.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.120]   Turn to Him afresh and pray, pray, pray
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.120]   for His supply of strength and wisdom and grace
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.040]   to do everything you do.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.600]   You're not your own.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.680]   You live in the strength of another.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.880]   He bought you for this, so learn to do this,
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.840]   namely, whoever speaks as the oracles of God,
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.560]   whoever serves, that's us at every minute,
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.680]   whoever serves as one who serves by the strength
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.440]   that God supplies in order that in everything,
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.880]   God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.400]   To Him belong glory forever and ever.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.000]   So pray, pray, pray, and be done with all moment by moment
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.240]   self-sufficiency and be utterly dependent on God.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.040]   Number five, belong to a Bible-saturated,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.120]   Christ-exalting, God-centered church
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.920]   that preaches the whole counsel of God.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.800]   And be connected there with God's people.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.320]   Don't wait 'til after college
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.160]   to be a mature, responsible church member.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.560]   Break the mold of late adolescents
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.880]   who think that life is just play and school.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.280]   It's not.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.840]   Life is responsible membership in a local church
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.120]   relating to people of all kinds and all ages.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.720]   So grow up, break the mold of those around you
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.920]   and grow up years ahead of them.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.080]   Number six, guard yourself from craving
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.960]   what the world craves.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.160]   If you find that hanging out with unbelievers
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.240]   is making you love what they love,
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.160]   rather than helping them love what you love,
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.920]   the one you love, back off and fill yourself
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.640]   with love to truth and to God some other way.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.800]   Same with media.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.840]   If the computer, the phone, the tablet
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.200]   is making you crave what is destructive to your soul,
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.280]   lay it down.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.200]   Cut off your hand, tear out your eye,
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.840]   do what you have to do to be radically devoted
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.520]   to Jesus and His holiness.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.720]   And the last thing I would say is test all things
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.560]   by the scriptures.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.680]   You have one life to live
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.320]   and it is not a good thing to experiment with it.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.360]   What will make life work?
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.000]   What will make my eternity happy?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.480]   God did not give you life to experiment with.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.080]   He gave you life and He gave you a book.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.160]   God has spoken.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.080]   It's not a matter of experimentation,
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.240]   it's a matter of application of God's word to everything.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.920]   He knows all things.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.400]   He knows what will make you happy in the long run.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.680]   He knows what will make your life count
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.720]   for the here and now.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.200]   So trust Him, know His word, test all things.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.680]   Beautiful, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.240]   And we have a number of other resources
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.400]   for students at our site.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.720]   Go to DesiringGod.org and type student
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.400]   in the search bar at the top.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.040]   And if you have a concise and specific question
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.800]   for Pastor John, like Nathan did today,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.160]   go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.560]   and look for the button that says Submit a Question.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.360]   You can also easily send us a question
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.840]   through our free mobile apps as well.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.360]   We're gonna be back tomorrow to talk about
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.480]   the street value of living by propositional truth
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.520]   in a post-propositional world.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.640]   I'm your host Tony Rake, you'll see you tomorrow.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:32.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
