[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   I'd like to call your attention tonight to the words found in Paul's epistle to the Galatians,
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.840]   in chapter 6 and in verse 14.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.920]   The epistle to the Galatians, chapter 6 and verse 14.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:25.160]   But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.640]   the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.920]   Now this follows on from what went before, the word "but" suggests that, so let me read
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.400]   again from verse 12.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.680]   As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.160]   only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.280]   For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law, but desire to have you circumcised,
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.720]   that they may glory in your flesh.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:12.400]   But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.960]   the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.560]   As I've just reminded you, this text, this statement, can only be understood properly
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.120]   if we do take it in its own context.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.280]   The context helps us to see why the apostle speaks, as he does in this way and manner,
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.880]   about the death of the Son of God, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, upon the cross on
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.920]   Calvary's hill.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.000]   He's finishing his letter to these Galatians.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.580]   These were people who had become Christians as the result of his own preaching and teaching.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.360]   But certain other teachers had gone round who had been upsetting them.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.560]   They taught that it's all right to believe in the gospel, but if you really want to be
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.320]   a full-blown Christian and want to be truly blessed of God, you've also got to submit
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.320]   to circumcision, go back under the old Jewish law.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.000]   The apostle has written his whole epistle in order to deal with that question.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.840]   And here he is now at the very end of his letter, and he's, as it were, summarising,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.240]   summing up all he's been saying, and at the same time reminding these Galatians and all
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:29.080]   others through them of certain fundamental truths and principles of the Christian faith.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.760]   And we've been examining these.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.640]   Let me hurriedly remind you of what we found.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.000]   The first thing he reminds them of is this, that life in this world is a very serious
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.520]   and a very solemn matter.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.720]   Life, when truly understood, is not the sort of thing that the world would teach you to
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.640]   think of.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.320]   Life is not something gay and flippant and light, a place through which you waltz, having
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.720]   a good time.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.720]   Not at all.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.520]   It's a tremendously serious matter for this reason.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.760]   Be not deceived.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.920]   God is not mocked.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.120]   For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.600]   For he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:22.920]   For he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.400]   Life is a matter of sowing and reaping.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.800]   And what a man sows, that shall he also reap.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.920]   There are certain moral laws in operation in this world which are absolutes, and we
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.240]   all of us are responsible beings, and we shall all go on and stand before God in judgment
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.000]   and give an account of the deeds done in the body, and our eternal destiny, and eternity
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   means everlastingly, will depend upon what we've done in this life and in this world.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.400]   Life in this world is a tremendous matter.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.640]   It's the most serious thing conceivable, because what we get in this life and what
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:10.080]   we'll get to all eternity depends upon whether we sow to the flesh or whether we sow to the
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   Spirit.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.280]   Very well, then, the most important thing to discover in this world is, how does one
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.280]   sow to the Spirit?
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.000]   How am I so to live that I shall reap the blessing of joy and happiness and peace in
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.920]   this world and in the world to come forever and forever?
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.680]   Right, that's the question.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.520]   But unfortunately, as the apostle goes on to point out, and as indeed he's been indicating
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.000]   in the whole of his epistle, as I say, that question, that problem has become somewhat
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.680]   confused because there are these false teachers.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.120]   The position had arisen in the early church as it still obtains today.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.760]   There are contradictory voices going out in the name of the Christian church.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.400]   They all say they're Christians, they all claim to belong to the Christian church, but
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.800]   they're saying things that are diametrically opposed to one another.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.520]   So we saw last Sunday night that the first thing we have to do is to discover which is
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.340]   the true message.
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.260]   How do you differentiate between the true and the false?
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.340]   The apostle has answered the question in this epistle, as he has answered it in other epistles,
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.840]   as indeed the whole of the Bible answers it.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.800]   And so we discussed last Sunday night the whole question of authority, the marks of
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.560]   the false, the marks of the true.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.440]   Very well, having done that, we now take the next step, the next step taken by the apostle.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.520]   What then is the true message?
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.800]   What is the Christian gospel?
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.360]   What's it about?
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.400]   What does it proclaim?
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.160]   What has it got to say to us?
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.520]   How can a man be right with God?
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.640]   How can I sow to the Spirit?
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.720]   How can I reap life everlasting?
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.960]   What have I got to do in this life and in this world which will render me immune to
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.640]   what may happen round and about me, which will enable me to smile in the face of death,
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.320]   which already assures me that I have nothing to fear when I come to the judgment of God,
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:23.080]   and which guarantees me everlasting and eternal bliss in the glory indescribable?
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.080]   What have I got to do?
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.760]   How can I get to that position?
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.920]   Here, I say, very fortunately for us, the great apostle answers the question, and he
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.360]   puts it in this glorious and tremendous statement.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.600]   "As for me," he says, "God forbid that I should glory."
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.880]   "Oh, the thing is unthinkable," he says.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:53.240]   "That I should glory in anything save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.120]   the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world."
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.280]   This is the thing in which he glories.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   This is the thing in which he preached.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:10.160]   And this, by the grace of God, is the thing that I am privileged to preach to you tonight.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.600]   It is still the same answer.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.160]   There is still only this message.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   What is it?
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.960]   Well, let us look at it like this.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.840]   The preaching of the cross, the preaching of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ on the
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:34.520]   cross on Calvary's Hill, is the very heart and center of the Christian gospel and the
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.000]   Christian message.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.880]   Now, I think you all must agree that that is an inevitable deduction from what the apostle
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.880]   says here.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.400]   A man picks out for that in which he glories the central thing, the thing that matters
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.640]   above everything else.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:57.320]   And what he picks out is the cross, the death on the cross on Calvary's Hill of our Lord
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.240]   Jesus Christ.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.120]   Now, this is, as I want to show you, the thing that he always preached, the thing that all
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.960]   the other apostles always preached.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.600]   If you and I want to know what is the message of the Christian church, surely the thing
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.040]   for us to do is to go back to the beginning.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.080]   How did the Christian church begin?
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.080]   What was the message?
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.120]   Here are men called apostles.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.360]   These are the men who founded the Christian church.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.880]   They all said that they were not preaching their own ideas, but that they had been given
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.440]   the message by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.440]   Very well.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:34.440]   If we want to know what the Christian message is, go back and consider the apostolic message.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.040]   And that is what we are going to do tonight.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:45.160]   And I am going to try to show you that the message was the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:51.080]   Now, what I want to emphasize is this, that this is what they preached, and they did so
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.520]   in spite of the fact that it was not popular.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.880]   The preaching of the cross has never been popular.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.360]   It is not popular today.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   It never has been.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.520]   The preaching of the cross was a stumbling block to the Jews.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.440]   It was foolishness to the Greeks.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:13.000]   The apostle says here, as I have already reminded you, "As many as desire to make a fair show
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.840]   in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised only, lest they should suffer persecution
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.400]   for the cross of Christ."
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.520]   The preaching of the cross of Christ has always led to persecution.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:34.480]   Earlier in this same epistle, the apostle has talked about what he describes as the
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.320]   offense of the cross.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.320]   It has always been offensive to people.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.560]   They did not like it in the first century.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.320]   The Jews did not, the Greeks did not, nobody liked it.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.320]   Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that it was not liked, that it was thoroughly unpopular,
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:55.880]   this was the thing that all the apostles preached, and went on doing so, and eventually suffered
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.760]   martyrdom and death because they persisted in doing it.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.560]   Very well then, I say, this establishes the fact that it was the very center and heart
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.600]   of their message.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.900]   And there is nothing that I know of tonight that is more important than that every one
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:19.880]   of us should realize that this is still the heart and the center of the Christian message.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.520]   In order to emphasize that, let me put it negatively first.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.500]   What is the message of the Christian gospel?
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.200]   What is the message of the Christian church?
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.480]   Now, at the risk of being misunderstood, I will put it like this.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:37.480]   It is not primarily the teaching of our Lord.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.600]   Not primarily the teaching of our Lord.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.560]   I put it like that, of course, because there are so many today who think that that is Christianity.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.880]   They say what we need is Jesus' teaching.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.360]   He is the greatest religious genius of all times.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   He is above all the philosophers.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.960]   Let us have a look at his teaching, sermon on the mount and so on.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.000]   That is what we want.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   What the world needs, they say, tonight is a dose of the sermon on the mount, a dose
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.480]   of his ethical teaching.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.880]   We must preach this to people and teach them how to live.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.400]   That is what they need.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.800]   But you know, according to the apostle Paul, that is not their first need.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.480]   And I will go further.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:17.340]   If you only preach the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ, you not only do not solve the
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:22.240]   problem of mankind, you in a sense even aggravate it.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.960]   Because you preach nothing but utter condemnation.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.400]   Nobody can do it.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   Nobody.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.000]   So they did not preach his teaching.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.520]   Paul does not say, God forbid that I should glory, save in the sermon on the mount.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.480]   God forbid that I should glory, save in the ethical teaching of Jesus.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.920]   He does not say that.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.160]   It was not the teaching of Christ.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.640]   It was not either the example of Christ.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.080]   That is often preached, is it not?
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.920]   What is the message of Christianity?
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.000]   Imitation of Christ.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Read the gospels, they say.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Have a look at him.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   There he is.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   That is the way all ought to live.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Very well, let us decide to do so.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.440]   Let us decide to imitate Christ and to live as he lived.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:06.400]   I say once more that that is not the centre and the heart of the Christian message.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.320]   That comes into it, but not at the beginning.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.880]   It is not the first thing.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.080]   It is not the thing the apostles preached initially.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.360]   Not even our Lord's example.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:25.360]   What they preached was his death upon the cross and the meaning of that event.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.800]   Now this is an assertion.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.120]   Of course, I must substantiate what I am saying.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.320]   Because people are ready to say, "Oh yes, but that is only your opinion.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.320]   You have attacked the other opinions.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.880]   Of course, like all you preachers, you say that you alone are right."
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.840]   But my dear friend, I want to show you that this is not my opinion.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.280]   I am going to establish what I have said from a book called the New Testament, which is
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:53.760]   a book written by or derived from apostles and apostolic authority.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.240]   What do you find when you examine the book?
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.680]   Well, this is what you find.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.800]   It was there at the centre of our Lord's own teaching.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.320]   Now, there is a very striking illustration of this that people do not often remember.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.080]   It is that great event which happened at Caesarea Philippi and what immediately followed it.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.280]   There, you remember, our Lord turned to his disciples and said, "Whom do men say that
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.280]   I am?"
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.280]   And they gave various answers.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.560]   Then he said, "Whom do you say that I am?"
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:24.280]   And Peter stepped forward and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:29.200]   And our Lord turned to him and said, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.720]   hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.920]   And then he went on to say that, "On this rock I, thou art Peter, and upon this rock
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.740]   I will build my church," etc.
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:45.600]   But then, listen, "From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:51.160]   that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and the chief priests
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:58.540]   and the scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.240]   Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying, 'Be it far from thee, Lord; this
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.880]   shall not happen unto thee.'
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:13.800]   But he turned and said unto Peter, 'Get thee behind me, Satan, for thou savourest not
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:19.920]   the things that be of God, but those that be of men.'"
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.640]   Now you see, after this great confession of Peter, after this statement that he is the
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.680]   Christ, the Son of the living God, he immediately introduces them to his death.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.280]   They can't take it.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.880]   Peter was not the only one who failed.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.680]   They all failed.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.280]   And so our Lord rebukes him and tells him, "You don't understand.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.920]   You think that the fact that I am the Son of God is the thing that's going to save
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.920]   you.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   It isn't.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.920]   This is the thing."
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.960]   And then, of course, you've got other statements.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.960]   There's that great statement recorded in all the Gospels where he turned to these
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:56.000]   same men and he said, "You've got to rethink the whole matter.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   I'm a king.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   I have a kingdom.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.760]   My kingdom is not like the kingdom of men.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.160]   It's not like all the other kingdoms in this world.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.960]   In this world, great men are served by others.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.280]   But I come amongst you as one who ministers.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:16.440]   For the Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.680]   a ransom for many."
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:25.720]   And then you remember, as I'll point out later, the Last Supper.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.720]   He arranged it.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.740]   He told them exactly what to do.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.960]   And there he stood and he took the loaf and he broke it and he said, "This is my body
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.320]   which is broken for you."
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.040]   And likewise, he poured out the wine from the cup and handed it round.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.040]   "This cup is my blood in the New Testament.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.200]   This," he says, "is my giving of myself, my body to be broken, my blood to be shed
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.200]   for you."
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.200]   Well, there it is.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.960]   There it is plainly and clearly and centrally in his teaching.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.160]   But then, you see, we have other things which pinpoint this in addition.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.040]   Do you remember that amazing event which took place on the Mount of Transfiguration?
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.280]   Our Lord went up onto a mountain taking Peter and James and John with him and there he was
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:11.520]   transfigured before them and two men, Moses and Elias, appeared in spirit form and they
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.520]   spoke to him.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.500]   And these other disciples were looking on in amazement.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.040]   But what was the conversation about?
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.320]   What did Moses and Elias discuss with our Lord?
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:27.560]   We are told, "They discussed with him the exit, the exodus that he should make outside
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.200]   the walls of Jerusalem.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.760]   They discussed his death with him."
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.900]   This was the momentous question.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:40.960]   The representative of the law and of the prophets discussed with him his death upon the cross.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   It's crucial.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:49.400]   And not only that, we read of him later on that he set his face steadfastly to go to
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.000]   Jerusalem though he knew exactly what was going to happen to him.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.040]   And another notable fact is this, if you are interested in statistics, read your four Gospels
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:05.880]   and calculate, make a little calculation in terms of proportion as to the amount of space
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.040]   given to our Lord's death in those brief records.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.400]   They are very brief records, but look at the amount of space given to the death.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.240]   How we are given every detail.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.120]   As someone once pointed out, it's so graphic and so detailed you can almost hear the sound
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:23.480]   of the hammer knocking in the nails into his hands and into his feet.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.880]   Why this prominence?
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   Oh, because it is the crucial and the central matter.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.920]   There it is in the Gospels.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.520]   When you come to the book of the Acts of the Apostles, what you find?
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.200]   Well, I read that portion from Acts 13 at the beginning in order that this matter might
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.640]   be settled once and forever.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.520]   Paul just went over the facts, and especially over his death, resurrection, and then applied
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:53.560]   his message saying, "Through this man and through this event salvation is preached and
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.840]   is offered."
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.720]   This is the wonderful thing.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:02.280]   And then you go along and you read about him visiting a place called Thessalonica, what
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.720]   we now call Salonica.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.720]   This is what happened.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.520]   "And as his manner was, went in unto them in three Sabbath days, reasoned with them
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:17.440]   out of the Scriptures, opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered, have
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:22.400]   died upon the cross, and risen again from the dead, and that this Jesus whom I preach
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.700]   unto you is Christ.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.920]   That indeed was his preaching everywhere, as it was, as I say, the preaching of all
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.920]   the other apostles."
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.640]   And when you come on to the Epistles, you see, I could keep you the rest of the night
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.720]   just quoting Scriptures to prove to you that this is the central message of the Christian
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   Gospel.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.080]   There's a wonderful one, I can't refrain from reading it to you, in Romans 3.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:52.400]   "Therefore, by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight,
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.600]   for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:01.440]   But now the righteousness of God without the law, apart from the law, is manifested.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.080]   Being witnessed by the law and the prophets, even the righteousness of God which is by
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.160]   faith in Jesus Christ, and to all and upon all them that believe, for there is no difference
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:17.440]   for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by his
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:25.640]   grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.640]   through faith in his blood."
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.160]   Blood, the blood of the cross.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.400]   This is the great theme of all these Epistles.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.200]   Listen to it in Romans 5 again.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:48.080]   "For when we were yet without strength in due time, Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.120]   For scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet peradventure for a good man some
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.600]   would even dare to die.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.560]   But God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.080]   for us.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:09.040]   Much more than being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.040]   him."
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.760]   And on and on I could go reading Scriptures to you.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:21.920]   The Apostle tells the Corinthians in the very first chapter of his first Epistle to them,
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.120]   "The Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:32.840]   We preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness."
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.520]   Not only that, he says in the second chapter, "I determined not to know anything among
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:44.120]   you save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.180]   This was his constant sermon, his constant preaching.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.840]   If you are in any doubt about it, let him summarize it himself at the beginning of the
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.960]   fifteenth chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.240]   "Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.180]   you have also received, and wherein you stand, by which also you are saved, if you keep in
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.840]   memory the things that I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:12.440]   For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received."
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.440]   What was it?
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:21.760]   How that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.840]   and that he rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.120]   But you notice, that's the thing I preach first of all, first in importance as well
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.120]   as in time.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.480]   This was the center of the message, how that Christ died for our sins.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.800]   He preached it everywhere.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.080]   In 2 Corinthians 5, he puts it like this.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.720]   He says, "I'm an ambassador for Christ.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.240]   I don't speak in my own right," he said.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.440]   "I'm not visiting you in my own right or at my own cost.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.000]   I'm a man who's sent."
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.440]   He says, "This is my whole position.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.760]   We are ambassadors for Christ.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:59.200]   As though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.240]   Be ye reconciled to God."
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.240]   Well, what's the message?
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:08.680]   It's this, "To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.000]   to them their trespasses.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.320]   He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   of God in him."
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.320]   I mustn't, my friends.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.320]   I'm tempted to do it.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.240]   I enjoy reading these glorious Scriptures.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.700]   But what I'm trying to establish tonight is this.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:29.500]   This is the first and central message of the preaching of the Christian Gospel.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.280]   Let me therefore take you immediately to the book of Revelation, not reading many of the
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.160]   things that I put down in my notes.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.160]   Listen to this.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:43.080]   Here it is in the first chapter of the book of Revelation, "John to the seven churches
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.880]   which are in Asia.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.840]   Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:58.080]   from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:06.160]   witness and the first begotten from the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:13.600]   Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood."
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.720]   Very well, there it is.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.440]   It's in the whole of the Scripture.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.560]   What right have you or anybody else, what right does any ecclesiastic to get up and
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:30.600]   pour his scorn upon the blood of Christ and to say the cross doesn't matter, that it's
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.120]   the teaching we want or that it's the imitation of the person that we need?
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:41.620]   The whole of the New Testament is proclaiming the blood of Christ, the death of Christ upon
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.800]   the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:50.280]   It is the heart and center of the Christian evangel, the good news of salvation.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.560]   And finally, if you want further evidence, look at this table, look at this cloth.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:01.600]   Underneath it there are plates with broken bread on and there are trays concerning little
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.160]   glasses holding wine, bread and wine.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.160]   Why are we doing this?
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.280]   Why did I announce this communion service?
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.280]   There's only one answer.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:14.720]   "I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you."
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.880]   It is the command of the Son of God himself, the one who instituted the Last Supper, who
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.080]   had that Last Supper the night before he was crucified with his own followers.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.480]   And he said, "Go on doing this.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.720]   Let my people go on doing it always.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.660]   Let them come and break bread and drink wine.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.600]   This do in remembrance of me."
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:42.760]   And we are doing this as the apostle that we may declare, proclaim, preach, announce
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:47.400]   the Lord's death till he comes.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.580]   Not his teaching, not his example primarily, but his death.
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.920]   This is the thing.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:58.040]   One of the sacraments has been ordained in order that we might never forget it.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040]   Very well, there it is.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.600]   It's the first and the central thing.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.480]   That's the apostle's first reason, therefore, for preaching it.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.100]   But let me ask a second point, which is this.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.600]   Why does he glory in this?
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:15.720]   Well, he does because, as he tells us, "It is by this cross that we are saved."
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.880]   You see, he puts it like this.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:23.840]   "God forbid that I should glory save in the death of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.960]   By whom?
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.200]   By which?
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.720]   The world has been crucified unto me and I crucified unto the world.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   By whom?
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   By which?
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.480]   Now, this is most wonderful.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:43.480]   He preached the cross because it is the cross that really does this thing that sets us free
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.600]   and gives us our salvation.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.600]   Now, this is absolutely vital.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:54.640]   The death of our Lord upon the cross in Calvary's hill was not an accident.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.420]   It wasn't the greatest tragedy of all time.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.440]   It wasn't something either that you and I have got to imitate.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.700]   These are the things that are preached about it.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.680]   This is what he said so often, "Oh, of course, it was an accident.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.520]   Needn't have taken place, shouldn't have taken place.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.420]   Those dull, stupid people, those politically minded Jews, those jealous people, those Pharisees
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.280]   who could see that he knew more than they did and could teach better than they did.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.280]   Ah, it was all a terrible tragedy.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   That's why it happened.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   It needn't have happened.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.280]   It's a great shame that it did happen.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.120]   So let's say as little as we can about it and praise him and his teaching and his example."
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:32.440]   That's the exact opposite of what the whole of the New Testament says.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:38.080]   The cross, the death of our Lord upon the cross is not something to be regretted.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.000]   It is not something to be explained away.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.280]   It's not something to be kept out of sight or of hidden.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.280]   No, no.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.280]   God forbid that I should worry.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.280]   Put it in the center.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.280]   Put it in the front.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.280]   Proclaim it.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.280]   Put it in the center.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.920]   Put this above everything else, as he's already put it in the first verse of the third chapter
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.240]   of this very epistle.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.440]   He says that he's amazed at the more foolish Galatians who have bewitched you that you
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:06.440]   should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth,
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.880]   placarded, enacted in dramatic manner.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.960]   That's the meaning of the word.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.220]   He held it before them.
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.560]   This was the center and the core of his preaching.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.560]   Why?
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.000]   Well, as he says, because it is by this that we are saved.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.600]   So you don't regret the cross and you don't try to forget it or to idealize it or philosophize
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.840]   it and turn it into something beautiful and wonderful.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.840]   No, no.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.840]   What you say is this.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.840]   I glory in it.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.840]   Why?
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:37.040]   Because it is by this that I am crucified unto the world and the world unto me.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.220]   It is the means of my salvation.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:43.960]   It is the very way in which I am saved.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:50.040]   In other words, the apostle tells us that he preaches this because what happened there
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:56.800]   when our Lord died on that cross on Calvary's Hill is the very thing that saves us.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:02.040]   If he had not died upon that cross, nobody would ever have been saved.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.000]   There would be no gospel to preach.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   It is the saving event.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.080]   It is the act whereby our salvation is accomplished.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.040]   That is why the apostle glories in it.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:23.040]   That is why Isaac Watts says, "When I surveyed the wondrous cross, it is the thing that saves
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.160]   us and without which we would not be saved at all."
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:31.240]   Now again, there is abundant evidence to establish this point, that it is the death upon the
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.960]   cross that saves us.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.040]   Listen to our Lord himself saying it after his resurrection.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.240]   I'm going to read you just at the end of Luke's Gospel.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.040]   He puts it like this.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:45.880]   "Then opened he their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:53.840]   And he said unto them, 'Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.600]   rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:03.360]   preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.440]   And you are witnesses of these things."
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.760]   And you must have noticed it in the reading at the beginning, just at the end, where Paul
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.800]   winding up his sermon in Antioch and Pisidia, having stated the facts to them, now puts
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   it like this at the end.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:23.400]   "Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.280]   unto you the forgiveness of sins.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:34.500]   And by him all that believe are justified from all things from which he could not be
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.440]   justified by the law of Moses.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.160]   This is the thing whereby we are saved."
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.680]   And the Apostle has already told that to the Galatians in the first chapter at the very
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.880]   beginning of his letter in verse 4.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:57.240]   "Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:05.620]   for our sins, that he might deliver us from this pleasant evil world according to the
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.500]   will of God and our foe."
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:13.940]   There it is, exactly the same thing that he's saying here in the summary at the end.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.340]   He was always saying it.
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:21.860]   I've already read to you out of 2 Corinthians 5, God was in Christ, reconciling the world
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.220]   unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:31.260]   "He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.260]   of God in him."
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.260]   Very well.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.980]   You see, the cross is the center of apostolic preaching.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.180]   It is the center because it is the thing that saves us.
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.780]   It doesn't ask us to save ourselves.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.700]   It doesn't tell us to do something that will save us.
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.500]   It says it's done, it's happened, it was happening there.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.500]   That's the thing.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.500]   By whom?
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.500]   By it.
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.500]   By which?
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.740]   There is the event which saves us.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.740]   It's a saving event.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.900]   That's why he glories in it and that's why he preached it.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:04.420]   Well, now that in turn leads me to the next principle, which is this one.
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.860]   How does this cross save us?
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.540]   That's what you want to know, isn't it?
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:17.860]   If any man who is saved is saved by the cross, and to be saved means that your sins are forgiven,
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.580]   that you are reconciled to God, you become a child of God and you begin to receive his
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.580]   blessings.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.500]   You have no fear of death and the grave and the judgment.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.020]   You know you're going to inherit glory.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.700]   How does the cross save us?
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.540]   Here's the question of questions.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.940]   Let the apostle answer it in his own words here.
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:45.820]   God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.500]   Have a look at the cross, my friend.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.060]   Have you ever looked at the cross?
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:54.660]   Have you ever with Isaac Watts surveyed this wondrous cross?
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.380]   I'm asking you to look at it tonight.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.740]   Look at those three crosses on that little hill called Calvary outside the city of Jerusalem.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.900]   Look at the middle one.
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.340]   Look at that person who's there dying.
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.860]   They're amazed that he's died so quickly.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:05.860]   Who is he?
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.300]   That's the first question.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.180]   You'll never understand the significance of what happened there until you're clear about
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.900]   who it was that was dying there.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:16.260]   Who is this person in the middle nailed to a tree, crucified on that cross?
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.460]   Who is he?
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:25.780]   And the apostle answers the question, "Our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.820]   Jesus, he's a man, obviously.
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.540]   You see, you look at him, you can see he's a man like the other two.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.220]   Ah, yes, but who is he?
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:39.780]   Well, he's a carpenter brought up in a place called Nazareth and worked as a carpenter
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.860]   until the age of 30.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.340]   And then he set out as a preacher and was an extraordinary prophet.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.620]   And people said that he'd worked miracles.
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.300]   He's a remarkable man.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.500]   He's an outstanding religious genius, perhaps a political agitator to boot.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.020]   Who is this?
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:56.900]   That's the question.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:05.900]   And the answer is that he is the Lord, which means that he is the Son of God.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.940]   You remember what he said to Peter at Caesarea Philippi?
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:13.660]   Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:18.100]   That's right, he said, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood hath
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:22.020]   not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.300]   If you were only looking with eyes of flesh, you'd see nothing in me but a man.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.300]   But you see more.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.060]   You know that I am the Christ of God and it's my Father who's revealed it.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.060]   That's the truth.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.380]   He is the Lord of glory.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.940]   He is the eternal Son of God.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:39.020]   He's the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.700]   He is God the Son.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.980]   But very well, you say, now then you land me with another problem.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:50.620]   If he is the Son of God, what is he doing there?
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.980]   If you say that this is the eternal Son of God who's come out of eternity into time
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.860]   and has taken unto him human nature and a human body, why is he dying?
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.660]   Why does God die?
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.420]   What is he of everybody doing there?
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.620]   How does he come to that?
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.940]   I don't waste your time any longer with the foolish modern suggestions and ancient
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.860]   suggestions that have been put forward.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.020]   That's not the death of a pacifist.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.580]   That's not the death of a good man who was misunderstood.
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.180]   That's not the death of someone who was too weak to assert himself.
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.220]   My dear friend, you're doing violence to him.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.220]   You're insulting him.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.220]   It's a libel upon him.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.660]   What's he doing there?
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:26.660]   He tells us himself.
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:29.980]   I've already quoted it to you.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:38.140]   The Son of Man, he says, is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:42.620]   his life a ransom for many.
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.700]   He taught them that he had come in order to die.
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:50.300]   I've reminded you of the phrase, "He set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem."
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:54.060]   His disciples, they didn't understand all this, and they did their utmost to keep him
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.400]   from Jerusalem.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:00.340]   We are given the actual record of this very thing.
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:04.180]   The same day there came certain of the Pharisees saying unto them, "Get thee out.
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.180]   Depart hence.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.180]   Herod will kill thee."
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:11.820]   And he said unto them, "Go ye and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out devils and I do cures
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.820]   today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.460]   Nevertheless, I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following, for it cannot be that
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.700]   a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.'"
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:26.260]   He knew exactly what he was doing and why he had come into this world.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.980]   And there at the very end, when he's surrounded by his enemies and they've confined him to
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.620]   the Garden of Gethsemane, his own disciples become concerned for him and they say, "Shall
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.240]   we go out and buy swords?
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.900]   We must defend you at all costs."
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:40.380]   And one of them drew out his sword and cut off the ear of the high priest's servant,
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.380]   you remember.
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.380]   "Put them back," he says.
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:46.820]   "Wist ye not that I could commend twelve legions of angels and be carried to heaven?"
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.020]   He said, "What do you think I am and what do you think I'm doing?"
[00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.820]   He says, "Don't you know that if I wanted to get out of this world without the death
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:58.220]   of the cross, I've simply to ask my father and immediately there'll be twelve legions
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:02.460]   of angels and I'll be wafted by angels back into the glory out of which I've come."
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.860]   But he says, "If I do that, how can I fulfill righteousness?
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.340]   How can I do the work that my father has sent me to do?"
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.340]   "No, no," he says, "he's come deliberately to die."
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:16.620]   Now there's a wonderful statement of all this.
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.980]   I read it to you to save time in the second chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews and
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.340]   in verse 9.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:29.060]   We see Jesus, "who was made a little lower than the angels," what for?
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.940]   "For the suffering of death."
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:38.620]   We see him now crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God should taste death
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.980]   for every man.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:48.780]   My friends, the Son of God is there dying on that cross because he came from heaven
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.940]   into this world in order to die.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.820]   That's why he came.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:59.860]   He was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.420]   He took on human nature in order that he might die.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.660]   It's not an accident.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.740]   It's not something to be explained away.
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:08.740]   It is essential.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.980]   He came to give his life a ransom for many.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:13.980]   Why?
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.460]   Why did he do this?
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.460]   That's the next question, isn't it?
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.460]   You're quite right.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.020]   Why did he do this?
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:24.780]   And the answer is here in the whole of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:28.020]   It's here in this one verse.
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:35.100]   He came because you and I and all mankind is guilty and under the condemnation of a
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.980]   holy God.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:46.100]   He came to deliver us from this world which is doomed to disaster and final destruction,
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:50.040]   by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.040]   We all belong to the world.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   We are men of the world.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.440]   We are born in the world.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:57.580]   And we will share the world's fate unless he can deliver us.
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.820]   That's why he did it.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:03.940]   Did you notice what I read just now out of Romans 3?
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.700]   For all have sinned.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.820]   There is no difference, Jew and Gentile.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.340]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:17.540]   All this nonsense about a good man and a bad man and a moral and an immoral man, it means
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.900]   nothing in the sight of God.
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.460]   I agree it's important from the point of view of the state.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.500]   But you know, my friends, in the sight of God, the most respectable non-Christian in
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:32.060]   London tonight is as damned and as hopeless as the vilest reprobate and sinner.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.100]   There is no difference.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.300]   Respectability doesn't count with God.
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.220]   Morality is nothing in the sight of God.
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.660]   It's filthy rags.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.140]   It's tawdry tinsel.
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.140]   It's nothing.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:48.980]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.500]   That's one reason why he came.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.260]   But then you say, "Why can't God forgive this?
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.860]   Why doesn't the love of God forgive a man who says he's sorry and who repents?"
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:04.180]   And that question is also answered in the Bible, and this is why the Son of God died.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:15.500]   God, unlike us, is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.500]   God is just.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.300]   God is holy.
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.300]   God is righteous.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.300]   Of course, that means nothing to us.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.140]   How can we think of holiness?
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:27.900]   We ugly, foul, vile, sinful creatures, no, no, we don't understand the righteousness
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:28.900]   of God.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.740]   That's why modern man doesn't believe in the blood of the cross.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.460]   He doesn't know what righteousness is.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.660]   He doesn't know what justice is.
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:35.980]   He doesn't know what law is.
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.620]   He doesn't believe in discipline, and his world is becoming a hell for that reason.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:40.620]   But God is righteous.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:41.620]   He's the lawgiver.
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.620]   He is holy.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:47.980]   He's so pure a countenance that he cannot even look upon sin.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.540]   And God can't pretend that he hasn't seen sin.
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.540]   God sees sin.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.220]   God sees everything, and God must punish sin.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:40:00.140]   His own holy nature insists upon it, and he's told us abundantly that he is going to do
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.140]   so.
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.140]   So here is the problem.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.860]   Man is a guilty sinner, and God is a holy God.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.540]   How can the two be brought together?
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:11.180]   The answer is the cross of Christ.
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.140]   How is it the answer, says somebody?
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.140]   Let me tell you.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.580]   I'm putting this as plainly and as simply and as briefly as I can.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.580]   How is it the answer?
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:19.580]   It's like this.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:24.060]   The wages of sin is death.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.420]   That's God's own pronouncement.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:30.620]   Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.340]   Now then, you go back to your Old Testament.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.340]   What do you find there?
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:37.020]   Well, you find a great deal about there taking a bullock, and the high priest puts his hands
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.220]   upon the head of the bullock.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.580]   They then kill the bullock, take his blood, present it before God in the holiest of all.
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.580]   What are they doing?
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:47.940]   It's God who's told them to do it.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.100]   Why did he tell them to do it?
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:52.620]   The answer is that the wages of sin is death, and that without shedding of blood, there
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.480]   is no remission of sins.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.340]   What they were doing in a picture was this.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.240]   By putting their hands on the head of the bullock, they were transferring their sins
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.240]   to the bullock.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.740]   The sins now are on the bullock.
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.100]   They kill the bullock and present his blood as an offering.
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:08.440]   God taught them to do that.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:13.220]   They transferred their guilt to the animal, and then the animal was killed and his blood
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.340]   was offered.
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.300]   They did that every day in the temple.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.860]   They took a lamb, a pure unblemished lamb, and they killed him and took the blood.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.580]   You remember what happened when the children of Israel were taken out of Egypt?
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:32.340]   That tremendous night when death came and killed all the Egyptians, but not the first
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.780]   born of the Israelites.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.780]   Why?
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:38.300]   Well, because they painted their doorposts and lintels with blood.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.740]   They'd taken a lamb and they'd slain him, and they'd painted the doorposts and the
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.140]   lintels with the blood of the lamb, and they were passed by.
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:53.060]   Their sins were not punished and their lives were saved.
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:56.020]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, comes.
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.860]   Why has he come?
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:02.140]   John the Baptist, who went round before him, he gave the answer.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.940]   John the Baptist had only got one son, and he kept on repeating it, and this was it.
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.180]   "Behold," he says, "I am not he.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.180]   I am not he.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.180]   I am not unworthy.
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.620]   I am unworthy to undo the latchet of his shoes.
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:18.020]   Behold, behold, behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.780]   All the others were but types and shadows and indications and adumbrations.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.460]   The Lamb of God has come.
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.940]   God has provided his own sacrifice.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:27.900]   It's his own Son, the Lamb of God.
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:28.900]   And what happens?
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.780]   Well, this is what happened on Calvary's tree.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:36.700]   God took your sins and mine, and he put them on the head of his own Son, and then he smote
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:37.700]   him.
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:38.700]   He punished them in him.
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:39.700]   He struck him.
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:40.700]   He killed him.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:48.340]   The wages of sin is death.
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:55.980]   So what was happening on the cross on Calvary's hill was that God himself was laying your
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:02.860]   sins and mine upon his own dearly beloved Son, and he paid the penalty of our guilt
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.940]   and our transgressions.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:14.500]   He hath made him to be sin for us that knew no sin himself, that we might be made the
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.700]   righteousness of God in him.
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:21.060]   God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.380]   That's what the Father did.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.380]   What did the Son do?
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.580]   Well, he was passive as a lamb.
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:26.580]   He didn't grumble.
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.580]   He didn't complain.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.020]   He took it all upon him.
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.340]   He allowed it to happen.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:33.300]   He surrendered himself deliberately and freely.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:41.700]   So again I remind you how the apostle puts it, "who gave himself for on behalf of our
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:47.900]   sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God and
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:48.900]   our Father."
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:55.060]   But still more wonderfully at the end of the second chapter of the epistle to the Galatians,
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:44:03.020]   "I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.500]   I am crucified with Christ.
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:12.020]   Nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and the life I now live in the
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.020]   flesh.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:23.020]   I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.660]   That's it.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:32.020]   God so loved the world that he gave to their death his only begotten Son, that whosoever
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:35.620]   believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:44.380]   The Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:54.740]   Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sin
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:45:04.460]   should live unto righteousness, by whose stripes we are healed.
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.260]   That's why it happened.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.300]   That's the meaning.
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.260]   That's why the apostle gloried in it.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.380]   It is the cross that saves us.
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:17.860]   He saves us by bearing our punishment, by taking our guilt upon him, and God smites
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.860]   him.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:19.860]   The law of God is satisfied.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.700]   I am dead to the law through the law.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.340]   The law has been carried out, carried out upon him, so I am free.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:34.580]   There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:46.980]   God so loved the world that he gave the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.180]   This is the preaching of the cross.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.180]   It is the cross that saves me.
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.180]   What am I to do?
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.980]   Do you know I have only one thing to do?
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:59.820]   I have nothing to do but to believe this message, nothing else.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.420]   Don't tell me you're going out to live a better life.
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:03.140]   You haven't seen it if you say that.
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.380]   Don't tell me you're going to be a better man or a better woman.
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.660]   Don't tell me you're going to stop this or that.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.500]   You haven't seen it.
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:13.540]   You have only one thing to do.
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:18.220]   Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:28.820]   the forgiveness of sins, and by him all that believe are justified from all things from
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:34.860]   which he could not be justified by the law of Moses.
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:45.180]   Only believe nothing else and thou shalt see that Christ is all in all to thee.
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:49.780]   I say, it doesn't matter what you've been, men and brethren, let me address you as the
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.500]   apostle addressed these people at Antioch in Pisidia.
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:56.420]   I don't know you, my friends, individually, most of you, but you know this is the wonderful
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.620]   thing about the work of a preacher.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.500]   He doesn't need to know his congregation.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.500]   What do you say?
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:01.500]   You don't need to know your congregation.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.500]   I don't.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.500]   Do you know why?
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.380]   Because I know the most important thing about every single one of you, and that is this,
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.900]   that you're a vile sinner.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.340]   I don't care who you are.
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.740]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.020]   I don't care what particular form your sin takes.
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.660]   There's a great deal of attention paid to that today.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.340]   The preacher isn't interested in that.
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.300]   I don't want to catechize your sins.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.140]   I don't care what your sins are.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:29.420]   They can be very respectable or they can be heinous, vile, foul, filthy.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.420]   I don't care.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.420]   It doesn't matter.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.860]   Thank God.
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:40.500]   But what I have authority to tell you tonight is this.
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:46.900]   Though you may be the vilest man or woman that London has ever known, and though you
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:53.420]   may have lived that life in the gutters and the brothels of sin in every shape and form,
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:59.340]   until you came into this service tonight, I say this to you.
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:10.140]   Be it known unto you that through this man, this Lord Jesus Christ, is preached unto you
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:13.180]   the forgiveness of sins.
[00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:22.300]   And by him, all that believe, you included, are at this very moment justified entirely
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:26.420]   and completely from everything you've ever done.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:31.620]   You believe that this is the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and that he died there on
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:35.340]   that tree for your sins and to bear you a punishment.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:40.620]   You believe that and thank him for it and rely utterly only upon him and what he's
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:41.620]   done.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:45.540]   And I tell you in the name of God, all your sins are blotted out completely as if you'd
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.060]   never sinned in your life.
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:54.860]   But his righteousness is put on you and God sees you in his Son perfect.
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:58.340]   That's the message of the cross.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:07.140]   That is Christian preaching, that it is our Lord by dying on the cross on Calvary's
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:10.940]   hill who saves us.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:19.820]   And that nothing else can save us, but that that can save whosoever believeth in him.
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:21.420]   You remember the Philippian jailer, don't you?
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.580]   That violent fellow about to commit suicide.
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:28.180]   Then he suddenly comes and says, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:33.620]   The answer was simply this, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:37.940]   in thy house."
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:45.900]   And he believed and he was saved and he began to rejoice from that very moment.
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:51.580]   My friends, that is why the Apostle Gloria is in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:54.100]   He had a message that he could take throughout the world.
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:57.940]   He could take to the blackest and the vilest and the most hopeless, equally to the respectable
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.380]   and all the good and the nice and the kind.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:04.360]   He could take it to all men.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:09.700]   And he had the same message for them all, that they were all lost and dead, but that
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:15.460]   whosoever believed this message was immediately justified.
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:20.340]   Very well, I have put it before you exactly as the Apostle did in Antioch of Pisidia.
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:21.740]   I want to ask you a question.
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:26.620]   Here is my question.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:32.740]   When the Jews were gone out to the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:37.020]   be preached to them on the next Sabbath.
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:38.940]   They wanted to hear more about it.
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:39.940]   Do you?
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.220]   Do you want to hear more about it?
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:46.300]   Well, I am not advertising next Sunday evening service, but God willing I am going on with
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:49.140]   this great theme.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:52.140]   And I am going to test you.
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:57.700]   If you have had even a glimmer of an inkling into this truth, you will be here next Sunday
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:58.700]   night.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.660]   You will want to hear more about this.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.860]   But if you do not want to hear more about it, this is what I say to you in the words
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:04.860]   of the Apostle.
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:08.340]   "Beware therefore lest there come upon you what is spoken of in the prophets.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.860]   Behold, ye despisers, and wander and perish.
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:16.500]   For I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:20.700]   declare it unto you."
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:28.700]   Tell me, do you glory in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:36.180]   Would you willingly and gladly spend all your days in singing the praise of this Son
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:44.660]   of God who loved you and gave himself for you?
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:48.020]   Let every man examine himself.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:53.800]   Let every man and woman answer for himself and for herself.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:59.540]   Let us sing together the answer given by Charles Wesley two hundred years ago in hymn number
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:00.540]   472.
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:09.500]   "And can it be that I should gain an interest in the Saviour's blood?
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:16.380]   Died he for me who caused his pain, for me who him to death pursued?
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.380]   Amazing love!
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:23.880]   How can it be that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?"
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:24.880]   Four hundred and seventy-two.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:53.380]   "And can it be that I should gain an interest in the Saviour's blood?
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:53:08.900]   Died he for me who caused his pain, for me who him to death pursued?
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:09.900]   Amazing love!
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:29.420]   How can it be that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:57.200]   This is the only mother of mine who can exhort his pain in my heart.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:26.100]   This is the only mother of mine who can exhort his pain in my heart.
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:56.000]   This is the only mother of mine who can exhort his pain in my heart.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:24.900]   This is the only mother of mine who can exhort his pain in my heart.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:53.800]   This is the only mother of mine who can exhort his pain in my heart.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:56:23.700]   This is the only mother of mine who can exhort his pain in my heart.
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:44.600]   This is the only mother of mine who can exhort his pain in my heart."
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:49.420]   My friend, let's have a little bit more triumph in this last verse.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.680]   We are singing heavily and too slowly.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.480]   This is a great hymn of triumph and of release.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:57:01.480]   This is a great hymn of triumph and of release.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:09.480]   This is a great hymn of triumph and of release.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:24.480]   This is a great hymn of triumph and of release.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:39.480]   This is a great hymn of triumph and of release.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:43.480]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
