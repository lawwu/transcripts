[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   I recently gave a lecture on breast cancer risk reduction, and I was sad to find that
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.680]   intake of vegetables, polyphenols, is such an important predictor of future risk of breast
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.620]   cancer, like when you're 50, 60 plus.
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.180]   And the most important time is when you're a teenager.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.720]   Now I have one daughter that eats vegetables, she loves them, and I have another daughter
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.200]   who eats food that's beige.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.520]   And it's very hard to get her to eat the volume of vegetables, you know, five colors a day,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.680]   which is what I do.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.800]   And if you have evidence that you could show a 17-year-old that they've got micronutrient
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.000]   gaps, I think that would be a motivator for them to eat differently at a time when it's
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.160]   so critical.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.840]   Even though it's, you know, 25 years in the future, that it's going to potentially change
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.000]   this arc that they're on.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.520]   What do you do for a young woman who doesn't like vegetables, or is not somehow able or
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.600]   willing to get those five colors a day of vegetable to help support the microbiome?
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.100]   Are supplements a useful tool in that case?
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.560]   What other sorts of tools, behavioral or otherwise, are useful?
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.560]   Such a good question.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.220]   So here I'm going to invoke Rob Knight at UCSD.
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.040]   So I think his gut project has really been helpful in terms of understanding what kind
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.440]   of modulators are going to be important.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.120]   So what I try to get that person to do, and I don't see many teens anymore other than
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.080]   MBA players, what I try to get them to do is to have a smoothie.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.260]   Very hard to get them to have a smoothie every day, but if I could get them to have a smoothie
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.400]   three times a week, and to throw some of these vegetables in, that makes a huge difference.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400]   I mean, we know that makes a difference in terms of microbiome change.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.560]   So you'd be blending up broccoli or kale.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.560]   Cauliflower.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.560]   So cauliflower is great.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.520]   Peppers even, they're putting things into the smoothie.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.520]   Yeah, I don't know if you can get a teenager to do that, but they often will use, like
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.780]   I have them do steamed broccoli that's in the freezer because it's got very little taste.
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.320]   So that, they could do that in a chocolate smoothie.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.500]   They could add some greens.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.500]   I like greens.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.580]   Powders are super convenient.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.740]   So that with kind of a taste that they like, whether that's chocolate, which is what most
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.520]   of my clients want, or vanilla with berries and that sort of thing.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.860]   So that can go a long way if you don't like vegetables.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.900]   And short of that, I would say some supplements, but I would say that's a distant second to
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.140]   making a smoothie.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.500]   I've got one patient that I have to mention because he took this to the extreme.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.240]   So he is a retired physicist professor at UCSD.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.860]   He found out that his microbiome was a hot mess and developed autoimmune disease.
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.400]   And so he became hell bent, like only a physicist could, on changing his microbiome.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:15.320]   And he dramatically shifted it by having a smoothie every day with 57 vegetables and
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.640]   fruits in it.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.240]   57 independent.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.160]   57 independent.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.080]   So I mean, this just warms my heart, the way that he did this.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.860]   But he would go to the farmer's market.
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.080]   He would just get a bunch of this, a bunch of that.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.720]   And he would go home, make the smoothie, and then stick it in the freezer.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.020]   So he'd have a serving every day.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.820]   But he became a completely different person based on this microbiome change.
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:50.120]   His autoimmune disease is in remission.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.720]   He dropped a huge amount of weight.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.240]   He went from being kind of this phenotype that I know you know well of a professor,
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.880]   high performing, traveling around the world on so many boards, so much innovation, so
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.200]   many great ideas, super computer guy, to being someone who gets up in the morning, gets in
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.900]   his hot tub, exercises for like one to two hours a day, and then does a little work.
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.380]   He completely shifted the way that he lives.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.620]   And his microbiome shift, who knows what's the chicken and what's the egg there?
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.940]   But he had a huge change in his physiology.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.540]   Glucose went from being quite high, he had, and he tracks all of this, of course.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.060]   It's like on a Jupiter.
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.060]   Right.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.500]   And retired, I suppose, might have had.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.940]   And he's retired, but he's got the longest time series of anyone I know.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.900]   And he's tracked his glucose and insulin going back 20 years.
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.000]   So he can show you, okay, here's where I started having my smoothie, and here's how my glucose
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:02.520]   and insulin changed as a result of that.
