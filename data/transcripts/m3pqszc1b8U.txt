[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   I'd like to talk a little bit about technology with the advent of text messaging.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.300]   So here I'm not going to talk about social media.
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.400]   This is not about social media.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.820]   With text messaging, first of all, this is the first time in human evolution that humans
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.360]   have written with their thumbs.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.240]   That's weird, been kind of quirky reflection.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.960]   But the other one is this is the first time in human evolution, meaning very recently,
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.360]   that we are aware of what's going on with so many other people and we're expected to
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.960]   at least know it and perhaps even respond to it.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.560]   Clearly our brain has adapted to this new format, but it did not evolve in this format.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.880]   You said, and I'll keep repeating it because I love it so much.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.120]   The more you can locate somebody, the more it reflects their values.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.240]   So being able to locate somebody in space and time and understand how bounded they are
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.680]   or not to their own emotions or yours is fantastic.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.520]   But the fact that you have 10 people in your phone that you're aware of, you're not even
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.840]   supposed to be aware of 10 people at once.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.640]   We're being forced to navigate a new landscape with all this.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.440]   My husband and I were talking about phones and text and social media and AI.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.840]   And I brought up something to him, he's like, I don't think I, in all the arguments I've
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.520]   heard, I haven't heard that, where I feel like we're changing in a dramatic way our
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.320]   basic evolutionary drive around attachment in a way where attachment has always been
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.640]   the primary evolutionary drive of humans.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.920]   And with all the different technological shifts there have been, because people say, oh, there's
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.400]   been this, there's been this, what's never been shifted is kind of the nature really
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.160]   of one-to-one human attachment.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.880]   We're entering into something really new where let's even say text messages, 20 at once,
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.080]   10 at once.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.560]   Our bodies will always crave what's immediately gratifying over what is long-term good for
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560]   us.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.840]   Another way I think about it is our bodies will always choose convenience and ease and
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.680]   gratification over what's good for us long-term.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.800]   So you think about all these pings coming in.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.920]   It's a lot of information, this text, that text, this text, this text.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.440]   And what you're doing in your circuitry and over time evolutionarily is getting used to
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.720]   the multiplicity of relationships, the multiplicity of information.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.860]   It's just more gratifying than one-on-one to the point that one-on-one conversation
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.160]   over text or even in person is going to have so much more of a gap than it ever has been
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:44.560]   in terms of how slow, how low stim, and how boring and awkward it is compared to, especially
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.960]   for kids who get this early, the constant information flow and gratification and stimulation.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.600]   I think that's going to have a profound impact, not right away, but over time.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.760]   And if you add in social media and then if you add in AI, I mean, on the way humans just
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.800]   are even able to relate to each other.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.780]   So yes, I think like this advancement in technology and what's happening, I think there's always
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.760]   been a trade-off, always, between how short-term gratifying something is and how long-term
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.520]   good something is for us.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.120]   Because the things that are really good for humans long-term are the things that involve
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.680]   humans to tolerate frustration.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.120]   I would say that is the most important skill, I think, for kids to learn.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.520]   But the world more than ever is built now with insanely low frustration tolerance because
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.840]   we're built for so much information, so much consumption, and so much immediate gratification.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.160]   This is actually, I think, the thing that isn't talked about with technology.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.340]   It's why parenting has changed.
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.340]   It's why so much of parenting is about making kids happy and their lives easy.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.260]   Because there's never been a generation of parents like my generation where our lives
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.100]   are just so much easier.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.580]   We have so much less tolerance for our kids' tantrums because we're on our phones wanting
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.620]   our life to be easier.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.040]   So we stop the tantrum.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.140]   We make their life easier.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.140]   We make them anxious.
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.560]   We make them fragile because of our lowered frustration tolerance.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.240]   So I don't know where we're landing here.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.180]   And by the way, I text.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.920]   I'm not like a purist here, you know?
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.920]   I am a realist.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.980]   I live in the world, you know?
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.900]   But I think it's profound how it's changing human interaction and expectations and gratification.
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.100]   My colleague Anna Lembke, who wrote Dopamine Nation, cited some data that humans have more
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.540]   free time now, across socioeconomic groups, more free time for everybody than ever before.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.800]   More expectation of immediate gratification.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.760]   And it's not just the texts that we're getting, it's for some people the texts that they're
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.760]   not getting.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.860]   They're thinking about the people that they haven't heard back from, etc.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.700]   The number of tethers, right, exactly.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.300]   The number of tethers is just astonishing.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.780]   I had a conversation with somebody recently that popped to mind where it was a little
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.120]   bit, it was like a low friction one that ended in a really good place where I said, you know,
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.620]   the problem is, you know, I was talking about, there's a little bit of an age gap.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.900]   And I said, you know, the problem is you think slow is low.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.800]   Like what I was saying was, I like to just chill.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.380]   This is something I haven't done enough of in my life because I'm pretty ambitious person
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.500]   and always have been since I was little about everything.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.820]   But I've learned that like slow isn't low.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:36.980]   I love just like sitting down and like hanging out with the dog or just like slowing down.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.020]   And it used to feel like slow was low.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.800]   It used to feel like, oh, nothing's happening or this is depressing or it's boring.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.580]   And I think in recent years that became more and more the case as I got more and more pulled
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.240]   into technology.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.940]   And then I did a little bit of a technology distancing experiment, if you will, have this
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.100]   wooden box that someone made for me and I put my phones in there and it's so amazing
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.480]   how once you put the phone in a different container, it like completely changes the
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.480]   relationship to it.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.480]   I don't get it.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:10.820]   But anyway, again, physical barriers to make, to take emotional steps, always a good idea.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.140]   And I just realized like slow isn't low, like slow is awesome.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.460]   So I totally agree that the circuits of our brain have now adapted to expect immediate
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.460]   gratification.
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:27.420]   I like to think, and maybe this is a false wish, but I like to think that there are components
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.100]   of our brain that are hardwired enough through tens or hundreds of thousands of years of
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.340]   evolution that might be able to recognize and appreciate the slow moments and not feel
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.700]   like slow is low, meaning slow is depressing.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.860]   But I do think that if one is weaned in, raised in an environment where you expect things
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.540]   quickly, well then, you know, it's going to feel like the horse and cart compared to
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.140]   the car at some level.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.140]   I do, I agree.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.140]   I think that's right.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.820]   And I think for parents who have young kids, I think these are such powerful and empowering
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.460]   things to think about when your kids are young, because I think it's easy to think, "Oh,
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.100]   okay, so I'll deal with this when my kid gets a phone."
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.100]   It's the circuits around even how your kid will use the phone, how much you're going
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.460]   to be able to set boundaries with your kid when they get a phone.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.700]   All these have to do with the patterns early on, right?
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:28.580]   So if we go back to slow is good, frustration and frustration tolerance is the name of the
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.580]   game.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:35.940]   It requires a lot of inconvenient moments that matter so much for how not only your
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:41.720]   kid learns to tolerate the frustration inherent in life, but I think this is really important,
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.860]   how your kid learns to feel capable.
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.860]   Kids only develop capability from watching themselves get through hard things.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.940]   They don't develop capability by being successful, ever.
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.180]   In some ways, it builds up this pressure and a fragility if that's been the only thing
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.740]   they have.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.460]   And when we think about this whole generation who's so anxious, kind of so fragile, I really
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.500]   believe the antidote to anxiety is capability.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.820]   And I'll give an example, like we steal our kids' capability all the time when they're
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.660]   young in the name of short-term convenience for everyone.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.260]   So here's an example, like I remember this day, my oldest who's now 13, he's like three
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.400]   and he was really into puzzles when he was three.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.660]   Puzzles are like really hard, right?
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.700]   He was working on it, something like, "I can't do it," you know, the classic whine, which
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.780]   I just want everyone to know, like no part of me is like, "I love that sound."
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.380]   No, like nobody likes whining, okay?
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.220]   But to me, those are our like bang for our buck moments.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.380]   You know, they're not our easy moments, they're our bang for our buck.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.020]   My kid is going to learn something about how to deal with situations they don't think they're
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.340]   capable of completing.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.380]   That is such an important lesson.
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.380]   And I have a fork in the road.
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:02.180]   I can either do the puzzle for him, which gives me short-term convenience, stops the
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.980]   meltdown.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.060]   But beyond frustration tolerance, like one of the things I really remember thinking when
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:17.420]   my kid was young is, "If I do it for him, I'm stealing his capability."
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:22.780]   Because if he can get through this and kind of get to the point where he says, "I did
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.660]   a puzzle I didn't think I could do," that's incredible.
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:32.340]   So I remember this because it felt so -- he's still whining, but there are these moments
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.020]   as a parent, and this is what I like to help parents with.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.320]   Our wins are not based on our kids' reactions.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.340]   Our wins happen when you just know there's this amazing feeling you have as a parent.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.780]   I know that was important.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.780]   I know it.
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:48.260]   And I remember saying to him with this puzzle situation, "Sweetie, I'm not going to do the
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.260]   puzzle for you."
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.340]   And I want to tell you why.
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.780]   The feeling you get when you think you can't do something, kind of take a deep breath,
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:06.260]   maybe take a break, maybe even the next day, watch yourself do that thing, is literally
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.620]   the best feeling in the world.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.980]   It is the best feeling.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.380]   It becomes addictive.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.460]   And I will not take that feeling away from you because I believe you're going to get
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.460]   it.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.460]   I could cry.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.500]   And one of the things -- I feel like people hear the story like, "Riley, Riley, okay,
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.500]   Becky, great."
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.560]   You know, I do not do that all the time.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.180]   Sometimes I finish the puzzle.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:31.240]   But when we think about what we want for our kids later in life, it might be, "No, I'm
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.620]   not getting you a phone yet."
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.180]   How a kid reacts to that situation, it's not just about a phone.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.140]   It's kind of, "Well, have you always just done the thing for me?
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.020]   Have you always just given me what I want?
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:48.780]   Do I have any ability to feel like I can tolerate frustration and wait and figure things out?"
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:54.620]   That all layers into how kids react to not getting a phone, how kids approach hard math
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.460]   problems, how kids do or do not sit down to start their English essay that is difficult
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.460]   to do.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.420]   And all that stuff, you can start building those skills in the teenage years, don't get
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.420]   me wrong.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:11.940]   But the leg up your kid has at 14, when they've been basically building those life and academic
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:17.620]   skills from the start, and they've built their identity around capability, like that's what
