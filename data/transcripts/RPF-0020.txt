[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.920]   So welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast for today.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.880]   Today is Tuesday, July 15, 2014.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.660]   And in today's show, we're going to be talking about one of my favorite subjects
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.980]   and a subject that I feel is absolutely valuable to just about every aspect of financial planning,
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.520]   which is entrepreneurship.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.320]   And I'm going to introduce you to one of my favorite podcasts that I enjoy listening to
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.520]   and the host of that podcast, whose name is Jacob.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.360]   Jake lives in the UK, and he's with us on the line.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.240]   And we'll just get right into it.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.300]   Jake, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.820]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.440]   Great to be chatting to you.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.380]   So I don't want to sound too much like an overly adoring fan,
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.480]   but I do want to just tell you publicly and then tell the audience that I have thoroughly enjoyed the work that you have done
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.420]   through your podcast, through your website, and then also through the book that you've recently written.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.460]   And I am sure that it has not been easy to produce all the content that you have produced,
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.740]   but I just want to say thank you for that, and I've really enjoyed it.
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.800]   So I appreciate all the work that you've done to produce the great content over the years.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.040]   Awesome. That's great to hear. Thank you.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.880]   So what I'd like to spend today doing is mainly talking about your book,
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.720]   which is called Becoming an Entrepreneur, How to Find Freedom and Fulfillment as a Business Owner.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.080]   But before we get into that, and I hope to get into some specifics and talk about some of the ideas contained therein,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.020]   could you give us just a quick background on yourself, a little bit of an introduction,
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.200]   and a quick background on your story?
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:36.400]   Sure. Well, I'm from the UK, and I did many things in my 20s before becoming an entrepreneur.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.260]   I did a lot of postgraduate study, wasn't really sure what sort of career path to go into,
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.460]   didn't really even like the idea of a career path and working for somebody else.
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:56.080]   And I started a business using some of the things that I'd learned in postgraduate research about pedestrian flows.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   So I started my own.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.520]   I started my own consulting company that was advising on pedestrian movement,
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.860]   and we were advising shopping centers and developers,
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.860]   and built that company until it got to the point where I was able to sell it,
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.320]   got its profitability, and then was able to sell it.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:21.920]   And at that point, I basically quit the rat race and decided to focus on just doing other things that would bring me fulfillment.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.260]   And part of those things has been learning about other ways that other people have quit the rat race,
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.920]   and that's really...
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.780]   That's really what my podcast, Voluntary Life, has covered.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.520]   It's been about sort of the key benefits that I can see from entrepreneurship itself
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.300]   for finding more freedom and fulfillment in your life,
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.740]   and also talking to other people who have pursued their own entrepreneurial ventures
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.040]   and found other ways to find ways to quit the rat race themselves.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.900]   So that's what I do now.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.400]   I'm kind of a perpetual traveler.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.900]   We're in the UK again at the moment, but we've spent most of the last two years,
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.720]   mainly in Mexico and South America, and I'm now focusing on writing.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.460]   So I've just published the book that you mentioned, and I have another couple of books coming out soon.
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.800]   And yeah, just really enjoying this new phase in my life.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.820]   I wasn't aware that you had new books coming out.
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.500]   What's the topic of your new books that you're working on going to be?
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.780]   Sorry, could you say that again?
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.420]   What's the topic of your new books that you're working on going to be?
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.580]   So I've got one that's just about to come out on a website called liberty.me,
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.780]   and that is a guide for negotiation.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.400]   It's a book all about negotiation.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.860]   So this is just a short guide, and I'm also working on a book really about for ways to quit the rat race.
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.460]   So I think you've seen that presentation that I did, and I'm writing that up.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.520]   So that will be coming out as a book later this year as well.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.520]   I have seen that presentation, and I'll make sure I would encourage if anybody hasn't,
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.940]   I will link to it on your website or your YouTube video at least of it in the show notes
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.400]   because it is well worth discussing.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.660]   And I like how in that presentation you pull together the different ideas
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.380]   and you bring together the four ways that you see to get out of the rat race.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.740]   And those four ways are off the top of my head, entrepreneurship, extreme savings.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.000]   What were your four ways that you categorized it?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.760]   Yeah, so basically unjobbing is one of them, extreme saving,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.820]   entrepreneurship in terms of getting a passive income business,
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.480]   and then selling a business.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.360]   Those are kind of the four ways that I've seen from people that I've spoken to
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.380]   to find a way to get out of the nine-to-five and get more freedom.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.960]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.000]   Now I remember the four categories.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.160]   So you pursued, in your story, it was number four, building a business and selling it.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.280]   Yes, yeah, exactly.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.820]   And so in my work as a financial planner over the years,
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.520]   one of the things that I have noticed is that in many ways people have very similar goals.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.800]   It seems that most people desire.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.800]   They desire to have more autonomy, more control over their life,
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.300]   more control over their schedule, more control over their direction,
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.300]   and also more financial freedom.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.300]   And so one of the themes that I've noticed over the years is that in general,
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.300]   the conversation about these topics goes to building financial freedom.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.300]   And so the idea is, well, I need to build up enough savings so that I can quit the rat race
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.300]   and have enough money to live on a passive income source,
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.300]   with basically having enough savings to sustain my lifestyle.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.720]   But I've observed that, in my work as a financial planner,
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.020]   I've observed and noticed that it seems to me, one of the trends that I see,
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.720]   it seems to me that no one really ever quits the rat race.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   So right now, in this sense, no one ever stops working.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.720]   And so right now, you would consider yourself to be financially independent, right?
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   Yes.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   And yet you are probably working a good number of hours per week
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   on your writing projects, on your podcasting projects.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   You are being productive for a fairly decent number of hours per week.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.640]   Is that a correct assumption?
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.640]   Yes.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:04.640]   And I think what I would say to that is that productivity itself brings me a huge amount of joy,
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.640]   as I think it does everyone.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   We get fulfillment from being effective, from getting things done,
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.640]   and from creating things and producing things.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.640]   The problem, as I see it, is not doing stuff and being productive.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.560]   It's when you have to work on things that you don't really believe in,
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.560]   like bringing you fulfillment or satisfaction,
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.560]   or having to work with people who you find really unenjoyable to be around and so forth.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.560]   So yes, I do lots and lots of stuff.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.560]   And I definitely see the opportunity that financial independence gives you.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.560]   Not an opportunity to sort of sit on the sofa and watch DVDs,
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   although I have definitely watched a lot of documentaries about the Roman Empire
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.560]   and who knows what else since I quit.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.560]   Sure.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.560]   But it's actually the opportunity to do whatever you love.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:03.560]   That's what life's all about, getting a chance to work on things that you feel truly passionate about.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.560]   So I'm a big fan of getting things done and being productive.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.560]   But the question is having the opportunity to work on whatever is right for you.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.560]   And to me, this seems to be the missing key that not enough people are talking about,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.560]   is that it's not so much that inactivity –
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.480]   so the thing that I've shared in previous episodes of the show, in my observation,
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.480]   is that motivated, productive people are the ones who accumulate the resources to be able to retire,
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.480]   to be able to not have to work for money any longer if they want to.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   They're motivated, they're productive, they're disciplined, they're savers.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.480]   They live on less than they make.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.480]   They accumulate capital and financial resources.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.480]   And then they can deploy that capital to the point where they can be financially independent.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.480]   But those types of people, it seems like they almost never quit.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   I did a show – I talked about Warren Buffett and Bill Gates and the – Mr. –
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.480]   Marriott and all of these people that are multi-billionaires and they never quit
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.480]   because they get meaning and enjoyment out of the work that they do.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.480]   On the other hand, there are – I mean there are millions of people throughout the world
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.480]   for whom work is drudgery, for whom work is toil and labor.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.480]   And many of them, it seems, desperately want to quit the rat race.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.480]   But they can't seem to – many of them, not all of them –
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.480]   but many of them can't seem to accumulate any resources to be able to – to – to –
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.480]   to do it.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.480]   And so what I see is that in financial planning, we should add a whole other step.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   And the step that I see is that we should forget about the idea of accumulating capital,
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.480]   to only be able to live off of capital at the beginning.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.480]   And we should first start with the idea of saying,
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.480]   "How could I design a – how could I design a lifestyle that fits me,
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.480]   that allows me to have autonomy and self-control and do the things that I want to do?"
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.480]   And that's probably the only real way to do that,
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.480]   is to take control over your destiny and to be an entrepreneur in some way.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   And so I feel like it's this rather obvious step that we should all be talking about.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.480]   But for whatever reason, entrepreneurship is not valued in our society,
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.480]   and people don't pursue that.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.480]   So my question for you, A, do you agree with me?
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480]   Has that been your experience?
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.480]   And B, why is it that we don't talk about entrepreneurship?
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.480]   Why is this not a business model or a financial planning model
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.480]   that's presented to people as a viable opportunity?
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.480]   Well, I definitely agree that entrepreneurship isn't talked about.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.480]   I mean, one of the things that I mentioned in my book is that
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.480]   I didn't learn anything about entrepreneurship at school.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.480]   I mean, and I don't think many people do.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   And in fact, quite the opposite.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.480]   I think that part of what happens in terms of the way that we're all socialized,
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:49.480]   especially in school, is we are taught for over a decade by people who are lifelong employees.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.480]   And we're given advice by career guidance counselors in schools,
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   by people who are lifelong employees.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:02.480]   And the whole design of the system of compulsory education is set up to, you know,
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.480]   basically put people -- to create employees, basically.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.480]   It's a factory for the production of employees.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.480]   And so I think the funny thing about entrepreneurship is that even though it's the engine of economic growth
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.480]   and even though it's absolutely essential to all of the great things that we enjoy
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.480]   in terms of our standard of living and the innovation that we have and, you know,
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.480]   and certainly it is respected still in our culture as well.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.480]   But at the same time, it's actually something that people don't really get much of an insight into
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:38.480]   unless they're lucky enough to grow up amongst entrepreneurs and have contact with entrepreneurs.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   And in fact, you know, it's even worse than that because unfortunately the popular culture
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.480]   often shows insofar as entrepreneurship even gets shown, which they don't very much,
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.480]   but when they are shown, they're typically like villains.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   You know, they're like evil characters who are trying to take over the world and do something dastardly.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   And they're often shown as being -- if not evil geniuses, then they're kind of like
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:08.480]   miserly and not, you know, not people with a lot of heart and so forth.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:16.480]   So I think in general, there's not a good basis for people to get an insight into the freedom
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.480]   that entrepreneurship provides and people do get what I call employee conditioning.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.480]   You know, you kind of get trained to be an employee.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:30.480]   And consequently, my experience was -- and I think a lot of people have the same experience --
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:36.480]   I had to sort of deprogram myself to a certain degree of all of the prejudices about entrepreneurship
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.480]   and about business in general in order to kind of make the jump for myself
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.480]   and decide that I was going to start my own business and go for it.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   Do you think that the programming -- and I'm curious -- so you mentioned --
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.480]   you cite in your bibliography to your book, you cite John Taylor Gatto's book,
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.480]   The Underground History of American Education.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:02.480]   And I've read that book and would encourage anybody who's interested in some of this history to go and read it.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.480]   That book, it's available free online on his website.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.480]   And if you just search, you can find a PDF, which is a little bit easier to read
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   than how he's released it for sections on his website.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.480]   But the book gives you some fascinating history
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.480]   on the American educational system.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.480]   And you opened one of your chapters -- I can't remember which one it was --
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   but you opened one of your chapters with a quote from John Dewey --
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.480]   or it was in one of your chapters with a quote from John Dewey --
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   that the primary -- something along the lines of the primary goal of the education system
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.480]   is to create well-socialized people that will fit into the social order.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.480]   That's my paraphrase of the quote.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.480]   Yes. Yeah.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:43.480]   Have you been able to figure out -- do you feel that this is just simply something that happened?
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.480]   Or do you feel it was maybe more designed?
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.480]   For example, did the facts just develop over time in a natural way?
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   Or was it more conspiracy that that seems to be the natural result of our education system
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:04.480]   producing willing, obedient factory workers who aren't able to effectively exercise self-autonomy?
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.480]   What do you think at this point in your research?
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.480]   Well, I mean, I think certainly there are some people who are really explicit about it.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.480]   You know, the John Dewey quote --
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.480]   the other I quoted --
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:20.480]   he's very explicit, like, this is our job as teachers is to mold people to fit in with the social order,
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   which is the opposite of individuation.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:30.480]   You know, the idea that the teacher's job is to mold you to fit in with what's existing
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.480]   is very explicitly said by him.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.480]   And there are other people who have made similar comments to that
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.480]   in sort of educational luminaries they've written about.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.480]   And I think that's a very good point.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   I think that's a very good point.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.480]   I think that's a very good point.

[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.480]   I think that's a very good point.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:26.600]   Yeah, I mean, in terms of what you said about selling and school and so forth, I totally
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.600]   agree.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:34.140]   And this is another aspect of, in a sense, the kind of complete insulation that people
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:40.420]   have from the entrepreneurial world because you don't get any exposure to the absolute
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:45.180]   vital necessity of selling as part of win-win negotiation in all relationships in life when
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.180]   you're in school.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.180]   You just don't get exposed to that.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.260]   Teachers don't need to sell.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.520]   And I think you're right.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.460]   That intuitively, good teachers sell.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.860]   Just in terms of trying to find ways of persuading students.
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.860]   They're good at it.
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.000]   But not because of the way that compulsory education is set up, but just because they're
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   good at it.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.400]   But when you look at the way that selling is kind of portrayed in popular culture and
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:11.780]   so forth, it is portrayed as if it's immoral and if it's kind of somehow ripping people
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:17.900]   off when selling is actually just the active side of win-win negotiation.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.440]   Selling is the process of persuading somebody of the benefits of what you're doing.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.980]   And that's what selling really means.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.680]   Of course, there are people who are shady characters who use selling to try and pursue
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.680]   fraud or so forth, but that's not inherent in the nature of what selling is.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   And the only other thing I wanted to say in terms of thinking about what you said about
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.680]   school and not learning how to sell, and the other thing that's really interesting, especially
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   in terms of the subject of your podcast, is people get no exposure to finance either.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.680]   And certainly, I think that's a very important thing.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.680]   I think that's a very important thing.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.

[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.

[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.

[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   And I think that's a very important thing.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.280]   I want to read this first section from his book.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.420]   It's six paragraphs from Chapter 1.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.640]   And Chapter 1 is entitled Breaking Free.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.140]   It opens with a quote.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:25.560]   Perfect freedom is reserved for the man who lives by his own work and, in that work, does what he wants to do.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:27.120]   R.G. Collingwood.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:35.440]   Entrepreneurship provides the best opportunity for anyone to experience the three most fulfilling intrinsic motivations in life.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.580]   Purpose, mastery, and autonomy.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:43.780]   Purpose is the motivation that comes from having an important reason for whatever you do.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.560]   It is the conviction that what you're doing matters.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.340]   Your work means something significant to you.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:55.940]   You have the satisfaction of knowing that you are doing something useful with your life and that your work has value in the world.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:03.220]   Mastery is the motivation that comes from a desire to achieve a high level of skill, control, and self-expression through what you do.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:08.180]   It is the sense that you're involved in work that enables you to gain a greater sense of effectiveness,
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:11.020]   and consequently, greater self-esteem.
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:15.360]   Everything you do when starting your own business is a chance at mastery.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:20.700]   The entrepreneurial skills that I found hardest to master were also those that became the most rewarding.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:25.260]   Learning how to sell, learning how to create a working enterprise, and learning how to make a profit.
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:33.160]   Autonomy is the motivation that comes from wanting the freedom to do what you think is best with your life, not what anyone else thinks.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:37.080]   Entrepreneurship is the only opportunity to seek financial freedom.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.120]   The freedom.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.960]   The freedom not to work on anything that you don't enjoy, that is open to anyone.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.640]   This is the most genuine sense of freedom that you can experience.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:50.260]   As an entrepreneur, you alone determine your goals.
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.100]   You have the opportunity to master your own challenges.
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.560]   You have the maximum freedom possible in what you do.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.800]   Your own efforts lead to your own achievements and rewards.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:05.240]   Entrepreneurship is an opportunity to live a purposeful life without regrets.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.040]   It is the freest and most self-experienced.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.740]   It is the most fulfilling way of life I know.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:14.360]   Hopefully you're inspired to go and read Jake's book.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.420]   I highly recommend it.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.720]   He talks a lot about fear.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:23.440]   He talks a lot about conditioning, about the things where we're scared to fail and where that comes from and how to overcome those fears.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:30.240]   And he talks a lot about his practical experience in entrepreneurship.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.080]   And he is certainly, in many ways, an inspiration.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.460]   He worked hard.
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.400]   He took risk in business.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.220]   Built a business.
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:38.940]   Sold it.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.580]   Kind of achieved his number.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:44.100]   And now he's working on projects that are important to him.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.420]   And he's doing them of his own volition.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.640]   But yet that's what the original entrepreneurial venture was in the beginning.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.000]   So notice also, again, that he is continuing to be productive.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.880]   This myth that we play for the rest of our life once we reach a certain financial freedom.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.200]   I believe it's just that.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.480]   As humans, I really feel we're driven to be productive.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.440]   That's our show for today.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:12.100]   Again, today being July 15, 2014.
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.120]   I hope you enjoyed it.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.160]   Thank you for listening.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.980]   Thank you for being a part of this show.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.020]   I trust that you've enjoyed the content.
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.100]   If you have any feedback for me, I'd love to hear it.
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.220]   I'm learning to be a better interviewer.
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.600]   And that's only going to come with more practice as I continue working at it.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.720]   But I really enjoy doing these things.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.040]   And I hope that you enjoy listening.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.360]   I would be thrilled if you have any feedback for me.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.080]   Send me an email.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.880]   Joshua at RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.360]   Today's show notes are...
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:42.080]   Are all found at RadicalPersonalFinance.com slash 20.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.160]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com slash 20 for today for episode 20.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.660]   So any show notes that you're interested in are all going to be found there.
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.840]   If you've enjoyed the content, may I ask a favor?
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:53.920]   Take a moment.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.320]   Hit pause on your player.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.560]   Hit pause on your computer.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.640]   And would you please leave me a review in iTunes?
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.400]   It could be good, bad, indifferent.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.100]   You can say that the content was great.
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.160]   You can say that it was terrible.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:04.780]   I don't mind.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.720]   I'll read that information.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.580]   I'll take it back in.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:07.300]   But that would...
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.160]   It would really help us.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.520]   The way that the iTunes rankings and all of the podcatching rankings work is based upon reviews.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:17.280]   So the more reviews, the more exposure, the more exposure, the more great guests I can bring on.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.960]   And so it's all kind of a virtuous cycle.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.420]   If you would do that and then send me an email letting me know that you have done that,
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.840]   I would thoroughly appreciate it.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:28.560]   And I will thank you personally with a gift of some kind to thank you personally for doing that.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.860]   It would just mean the world to me.
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:34.120]   So email me at Joshua at RadicalPersonalFinance.com and consider leaving a review.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.540]   I would thoroughly appreciate it.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.140]   In the meantime, have a...
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.100]   Excellent Tuesday.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:38.220]   Have a great day.

[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:41.780]   Have a great day.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:41.800]   Have a great day.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:41.860]   Have a great day.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:41.920]   Have a great day.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:41.980]   Have a great day.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:42.020]   Have a great day.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:42.060]   Have a great day.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:42.120]   Have a great day.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:42.180]   Have a great day.
