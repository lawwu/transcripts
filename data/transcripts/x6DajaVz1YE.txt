[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.800]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.200]   with John Piper.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.500]   Podcast listener Bridget writes in to say this,
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.500]   "Pastor John, I love the Lord deeply
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.460]   "and my faith continues to grow,
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.460]   "but I've always struggled with Matthew 27,
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.680]   "verses 45 and 46.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.520]   "Why would Jesus call out to the Father,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.500]   "why have you forsaken me, when Jesus knew the answer?
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.240]   "It was for this very reason Jesus came,
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.100]   "to be forsaken on our behalf.
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.840]   "Could you give some insight into why Jesus asks
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.820]   "this question so that this hurdle in my faith
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.940]   "can be removed?"
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.480]   - My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.480]   Those terrifying words occur in the two gospels,
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.920]   Matthew and Mark, Matthew 27, 46 and Mark 15, 34.
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.600]   As Jesus is hanging on the cross near death,
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.960]   so it says about the ninth hour,
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.740]   Jesus cried out with a loud voice.
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.880]   Amazing, how did he have any strength to do a loud voice?
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.880]   Eli, Eli, lemah sabachthani, the Aramaic form.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.160]   That is, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.800]   Now, one very important fact to remember
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.800]   is that these words are the exact first words of Psalm 22.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   And that's important because Jesus seems to have known
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.040]   that the whole Psalm, in some way or other, was about him.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.680]   Because at least three other parts of this Psalm
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.660]   are quoted in the story of his death.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.340]   So you got verses one and two, this is what the Psalm says.
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.880]   Why are you so far from saving me?
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.280]   From the words of my groaning, oh my God.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.060]   I cry by day, but you do not answer.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.600]   And by night I find no rest.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.240]   My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.300]   And then verse seven.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.280]   All who seek me, see me, mock at me.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.580]   They make mouths at me.
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.800]   They wag their heads.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.180]   Those exact words, they wag their heads,
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.240]   quoted in Matthew 27, 39.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.720]   And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.760]   to show that this Psalm is being played out
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.560]   in the death of Jesus.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.480]   And then verse 16 of the Psalm.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.280]   They have pierced my hands and feet.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.880]   And then verse 18.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.680]   They divide my garments among them.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.040]   And for my clothing they cast lots.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.760]   So the words, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me,
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.720]   are part of this Psalm that contains, as it were,
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.080]   a script for Jesus' last hours.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.680]   Now, why did he say it?
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.280]   She wants to know why the why.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.320]   Why did he say it?
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.240]   And here's a three-part answer.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.200]   One, there was a real forsakenness.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.600]   That's why.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.640]   My God, my God, why have you forsaken me
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.080]   means he really did.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.400]   He really did.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.120]   He's bearing our sin.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.280]   He bore our judgment.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.160]   The judgment was to have God the Father pour out his wrath on us.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.880]   And instead, he pours it out on him.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.040]   And that necessarily involves a kind of abandonment.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.200]   That's what wrath means.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.360]   He gave him up to suffer the weight of all the sins of all
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.840]   of his people.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.480]   And the judgment, the judgment for those sins.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.040]   And we cannot fathom.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.760]   I don't think we can begin to fathom all
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.360]   that this would mean between the Father and the Son.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.280]   To be forsaken by God is the cry of the damned.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.840]   And he was damned for us.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.960]   So he used these words because there was a real forsakenness.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.120]   That's the first reason.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.240]   Second, the why, it seems to me, is not
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.840]   a question looking for an answer,
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.560]   but a way of expressing the horrors of abandonment.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.600]   A couple of reasons for thinking this.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.560]   Jesus knew ahead of time what he was doing
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.440]   and what would happen to him and why he was doing it.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.320]   His Father had sent him for this, this very moment.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.840]   And he had agreed to come, knowing all that would happen.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.720]   Listen to these words.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.400]   This is John 18, 4.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.920]   "Then Jesus, knowing all that would happen to him,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.600]   came forward and said to the arresting mob, 'Who do you
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.200]   seek?'"
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.160]   Gave himself up.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.680]   So he knew.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.640]   He knew it was coming.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.280]   He knew everything.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.880]   And another reason is the moment was one of agony,
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.200]   not theological curiosity.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.000]   The moment was one of agony.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.720]   And a third thought on the fact that he's not
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.560]   asking a question so much as expressing a horror
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:37.640]   is the words are a reflex of immersion in Psalm 22.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.520]   Seems.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.160]   I mean, they're a direct quotation.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.280]   But when you're hanging on the cross,
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.600]   you don't say, oh, I want to quote some scripture here.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.800]   It either is in you as the very essence
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.440]   of your messianic calling, or it's not.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.560]   And if it's in you, then you give vent
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.400]   at the worst moment of your life with the appointment
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.560]   of your father scripted in Psalm 22.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.880]   That seems to be right at the heart of what's going on.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.320]   Let me read verses 22 to 24 of this psalm.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.840]   It goes like this, Psalm 22.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.560]   "I will tell of your name to my brothers
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.360]   in the midst of the congregation.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.520]   I will praise you.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.320]   You who fear the Lord, praise him.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.240]   All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.160]   Stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel,
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.160]   for he has not despised or abhorred
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.000]   the affliction of the afflicted.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.600]   And he has not hidden his face from him,
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.840]   but has heard when he cried."
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.400]   In other words, this psalm ends with a note of triumph.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.600]   So Jesus isn't curious about wondering,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.800]   how's this going to turn out?
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.840]   He had embedded in his soul both the horrors
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.480]   of the moment of abandonment, and he
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.440]   had embedded in his soul for the joy that was set before him,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.800]   I've got a promise, and God will not despise me in the end.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.880]   He will take me back.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.200]   So at some level, he knows it's not a final cry
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.640]   or an ultimate cry.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.560]   He endured the cross for the joy that was set before him.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.000]   And the why is not a request for a theological answer.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.200]   It's a real cry of spiritual desolation
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.120]   with words that were second nature,
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.800]   because his whole life was scripted by God.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.600]   And I think the last reason, we should say, for this,
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.080]   therefore, is that this psalm was his life,
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.400]   crying out reflexively in agony with these words
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.120]   of this psalm, "Show that as horrible as it is,
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.040]   it was all going according to plan."
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.000]   All of it was the fulfillment of scripture.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.440]   Even the worst of it was the fulfillment of scripture.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.280]   And that moment was probably the worst moment
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:27.040]   in the history of the world, and it was scripture fulfilled.
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.960]   So he said these words, one, because there
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.280]   was a real forsakenness for our sake.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.400]   Two, he was expressing desolation,
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.240]   not asking for an answer.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.120]   And three, he was amazingly fulfilling scripture
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.200]   in the horror of it all and witnessing
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.760]   to the perfection of the plan of salvation.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.800]   Thank you, Pastor John.
