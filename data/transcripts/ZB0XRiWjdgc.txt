[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   So in the past I used Jupyter notebooks for EDA, but this was not very convenient.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.000]   When I communicated with subject matter experts, I would often save a notebook as an HTML file,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.920]   share it over the email. This was not very efficient. We communicated over emails, over Slack,
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.320]   often we needed meetings to discuss. Fortunately, now we can do this more efficiently with weights
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.560]   and biases. We want to document our data exploration and we want to share it with our
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.400]   team. So let's add the table to a report. Let's create a new report.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.960]   We'll give it a new title.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:56.480]   And let's take a look at the distribution of attributes in this data set. All of the
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.960]   images are in the same data set, so maybe we can group it by the data set column.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:11.600]   We can now see the histograms and the distribution of our attributes and labels here. You can see
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.800]   that p1 and p2 are imbalanced, so we should take a closer look at it. Most of the classes
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:28.160]   are represented in each image. One exception is bicycle. There are very few bicycle images,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.800]   so we need to put some special attention to it. Let's note down our findings in the report.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:51.840]   [no audio]
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.360]   A table is represented as a width expression in the report, so we can copy this expression.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.160]   Now we will create a new width panel and paste that expression here. This will essentially
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:14.000]   duplicate this table. We are interested in the p1 attribute, so let's now group by this attribute.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.360]   We can maybe sort this table now and make it a bit bigger.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.280]   [no audio]
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.040]   Let's look at the images. Maybe we can change the settings of this column.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:46.800]   [no audio]
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.360]   Maybe let's look at five images at a time, and maybe let's remove the mask for now.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:04.080]   And now what we can see is when we grouped by this p1 attribute, similar images appear in each group.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.240]   It looks like they were taken from the same car,
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:15.440]   maybe on the same day, and this can mean that these images come from the same video.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.840]   [no audio]
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.720]   They are potentially different frames from the same video. This will be important in the future
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.000]   when we split our data across training, validation, and test sets. So let's note down this finding.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:49.920]   [no audio]
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.520]   Let's also look now at one of the rare classes. We'll duplicate the table again.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.400]   And let's group it by bicycle now. We know there are very few bicycle images
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.680]   in this table. In fact, we can see there are 59 in our data set.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.440]   Let's again change the settings.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:23.600]   And now we're specifically interested in the bicycle class, so let's just look at these annotations.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.800]   It looks like the bicycle annotations are very small and
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.400]   potentially noisy, so it may be hard for our models to learn this class.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.320]   Let's note down our findings again.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:56.720]   After completing our analysis, we can save our report and share it with our team members.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.360]   See you in the next video!
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.520]   See you in the next video!
