[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200]   - Well, Pastor John and Noel are back in the Twin Cities.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.920]   Thank you for your prayers as they traveled
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.640]   and ministered in Brazil and Argentina.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.840]   It sounds like the trip was a big success.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.160]   Here are just a few updates from the trip by the numbers.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.600]   25,000, that was the total number of people
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.600]   who heard Pastor John speak at live events, 25,000 folks.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.120]   1,300 is the number of pastors who convened
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.120]   at two events with Pastor John, 1,300 pastors, amazing.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.880]   And 20,000 free copies of books were given away
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.520]   on this trip, including titles like "Expository Exaltation,"
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.280]   "God is the Gospel," and "Dangerous Duty of Delight,"
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.160]   20,000 books given away.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.480]   And on top of those big numbers came several personal
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.720]   testimonies of how God has used Pastor John's ministry
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.720]   over the years to bring in people's lives,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.120]   saving faith, to restore broken marriages,
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.840]   and even to rescue one man from suicide.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.480]   It's incredible, both the big stats
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.760]   and especially those individual stories
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.180]   that you really only hear in face-to-face meetings
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.320]   when you're on the road like this.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.340]   And on top of it all, God kept the Pipers
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.260]   and DG's team safe and healthy on the road.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.080]   I miss all the flights and the hotels and the travel
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.200]   in this eight-day whirlwind of a trip
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.860]   to Brazil and Argentina.
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.000]   Again, thank you for supporting us and for praying for us
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.700]   so that we can send them out on the road
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.280]   to do ministry like this.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.740]   And the day the Pipers flew to South America,
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.460]   I flew to Texas to speak on campus at Texas A&M,
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.320]   or TAMU as it's affectionately called.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.480]   There I spoke to students about social media,
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.880]   digital temptations, and smartphone habits.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.400]   The topics for conversation centered around my two books,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.600]   "12 Ways Your Phone is Changing You"
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.320]   and the new one, "Competing Spectacles."
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.720]   The campus assembly was put on by Rachio Christi TAMU
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.000]   and by the Veritas Forum.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.400]   It was made possible by a new friend, Micah Green,
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.200]   who serves as the Associate Professor
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.360]   of Chemical Engineering at the school,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.520]   and by an old friend, Jared Oliphant,
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.160]   a PhD student in philosophy at TAMU,
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.120]   who moderated the event.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.960]   We had a solid turnout, really good engagement,
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.200]   and since there's no new Piper audio this week,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.400]   you're getting some new Ranky audio,
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.200]   and I can hear your disappointment already.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.360]   Today's episode is that hour-long gathering
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.660]   with students on fighting back
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.220]   against compulsive smartphone habits,
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.600]   and it opened with a robust howdy,
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.880]   which is how you get a whole room
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.240]   to quiet down immediately in Texas.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.680]   Apparently every howdy calls for an equal response.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.240]   And here's the howdy, and here's the discussion.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.080]   - Howdy.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.640]   - Howdy.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.320]   - I wanna start off, I'll introduce Tony,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.600]   and then he'll talk about himself for a minute,
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.040]   but he is, as Zach said,
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.600]   involved in Desiring God Ministries.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.040]   He's the Communications Director for that ministry.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.000]   He's also the author of a number of books,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.440]   one of which will kind of be the focus
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.840]   of what we're gonna be doing tonight.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.540]   Some of those books include Lit,
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.680]   which is kind of a theology of reading.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.280]   Highly recommend that book, all the books,
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.960]   but I like that one in particular.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.200]   He wrote a book on Newton on the Christian life,
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   and this is kind of gonna be the one
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.440]   that we focus on tonight,
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.080]   12 Ways Your Phone is Changing You.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.600]   And it's kind of self-explanatory.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.000]   It's about the ways your phone is changing you,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.240]   technology, Christianity, philosophy,
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.800]   how all those things intersect,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.680]   and how to think about that in kind of a smart,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.880]   engaging way, so recommend that as well.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.480]   He has an upcoming book called Competing Spectacles,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.400]   and like Zach said, there's some samples of these
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.840]   in the back if you wanna take a look,
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.200]   but this comes out in April, right?
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.040]   He is also the host of Ask Pastor John,
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.400]   so if you recognize his voice,
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.680]   he's on there doing his thing, too,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.780]   asking Pastor John questions
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.440]   through Desiring God Ministries.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.280]   So let me frame tonight just very briefly.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.720]   Tonight is gonna be a dialogue,
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.960]   and I want it to be focusing on the big questions.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.920]   We're gonna be focusing on technology,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.520]   we're gonna be focusing on smartphone usage,
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.200]   and how that's affecting us,
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.100]   and we're gonna be focusing on the big questions, all right?
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.640]   So things like IT-related questions,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.520]   like which phone to get, an iPhone versus whatever
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.520]   the other one is that blows up in your face.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.040]   We're not gonna be addressing those kinds of questions.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.440]   I went with one that doesn't blow up in my face,
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.680]   but that's your call.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.080]   So we're not gonna be addressing IT-related questions.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.040]   It's gonna be how to think about social media,
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.120]   how to think about smartphones, those kinds of things.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.340]   So that's gonna be the kinds of questions
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.320]   that I'll be asking,
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.160]   and hopefully you all will be asking as well.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.680]   And my role really is just to kinda facilitate the dialogue,
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.880]   so it's gonna be a dialogue with Tony and myself,
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.440]   and also with you all as well.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.440]   So hopefully that kinda frames the context
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.780]   of what we're doing tonight.
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.280]   So first off, if you would just indulge me,
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.480]   I wanna know, there's a lot of people here,
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.620]   and I want it to feel a little bit more intimate,
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.080]   but how many people have taken out their phone
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.520]   and taken a picture of this room
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.980]   while they're in the room, something in this room?
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.920]   That's it?
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.500]   Wow, okay.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.120]   Okay, so only a few people.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.580]   You're allowed to, just so you know.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.360]   I was expecting much more people.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.760]   But I wanted to get kind of a survey
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.640]   of how many people are snapping shots,
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.800]   posting it to various social media.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.640]   That's good to know.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.440]   Hopefully anybody is doing it.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.640]   We'll see how this goes.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.160]   So first question I wanna ask,
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.080]   again, I wanna get to know Tony a little bit,
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.920]   so you know who I'm talking to, who we're talking to.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.200]   Can you talk a little bit about your role,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.920]   how you see yourself on this topic of smartphone usage,
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.760]   social media, what's your background,
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.880]   career, those kinds of things?
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.920]   Let us get to know you a little bit.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.760]   - Happy to.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.240]   Honored to be here, by the way.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.040]   I'm a Nebraska boy, so I do feel like
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.280]   I'm in enemy territory here a little bit.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.720]   But I've been well-received,
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.840]   and so grateful to be on campus with you guys.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.160]   I did take a picture of the room, so I'm guilty.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.640]   And that's part of the story, is like,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.440]   I'm not here saying, shame on you for abusing a smartphone.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.720]   I'm here saying, I've abused my smartphone
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.240]   for at least 10 years.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.320]   I mean, I'm still trying to figure out
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.200]   how to live online, how to work online,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.520]   and how to do it in a way that doesn't
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.240]   have ill effects on my family and my kids.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.560]   So I've got three kids, 17, 13, and 11 year old.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.280]   I'm starting to see digital technology
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.120]   really take over their lives,
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.520]   and helping them walk through things as well.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.400]   And I'm coming alongside of them and saying,
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.040]   hey, guess what, dad is a smartphone addict too.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.480]   I've had a smartphone since 2007, when it came out.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.480]   I can't remember a day without a smartphone since.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.680]   I don't think there was one.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.160]   So I've always had a smartphone right by my side.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.120]   Until I started to charge it outside the bedroom,
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.040]   it was always within arm's reach, 24/7.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.880]   So probably some of you can relate to that as well.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.120]   And so I'm with you, I'm trying to figure out,
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.760]   okay, why is it that I grab for this phone so often?
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.680]   What is it that I really want?
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.680]   What am I looking for in the phone?
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.520]   And so that drove me to write the book
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.520]   "12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You,"
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.360]   which is really just a self-criticism project.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.280]   It was like, what am I doing wrong?
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.200]   What do I need to change?
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.320]   And my wife is the editor of the book,
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.160]   so everything I propose, she now knows
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.040]   that I wanna propose it, and so I'm now accountable to her.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.040]   So it's a very personal story,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.440]   it's a very personal journey for me
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.800]   in trying to figure these things out
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.640]   and then come alongside my kids
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.600]   and help them get ready for the generation
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.000]   that they're in, where they have to know
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.520]   how to be adept digitally, and yet also self-controlled.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.640]   And so I just wanna serve them,
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.800]   and I wanna be a better husband,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.680]   I wanna be a better father, I wanna be a better employee,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.320]   and that's gonna take self-discipline.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.880]   So I needed to work through these things myself.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.720]   - That's helpful.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.880]   I wanna start out specifically on phone usage
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.000]   and those kinds of things.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.200]   Can you talk about, what are some of the psychological
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.600]   effects that you've seen, that you've studied?
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.400]   Is there data that we can look at
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.560]   as far as links to things like depression
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.040]   and those kinds of things?
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.280]   What are you seeing out there,
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.120]   either from academia or other things
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.240]   that you're looking at that links smartphone usage,
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.120]   social media usage, with how that affects our brain?
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.680]   - Yeah, so there's a growing mountain of studies
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.400]   that are now showing the physiological impact
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.680]   of smartphone usage on our lives.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.680]   We're talking about things like inactivity
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.400]   and obesity are on the rise,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.920]   directly connected to smartphones.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.040]   Stress and anxiety are on the rise
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.320]   for most of us who have smartphones.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.720]   We're feeling more and more stress,
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.480]   we're feeling more and more anxious
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.080]   in this age that we live in.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.240]   But if you look at teenagers in high school,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.960]   you're starting to see spikes in anxiety and depression
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.160]   among high school students.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.120]   I'm sure some of you have seen that firsthand.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.360]   I talk with superintendents of public schools,
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.040]   public high schools specifically, in the Minneapolis area,
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.800]   and they're saying they're just inundated
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.480]   by psychological issues that are,
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.640]   if not entirely related to smartphones,
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.600]   at least indirectly related to smartphone use.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.240]   And so I'm talking about superintendents
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.120]   who have been in a public school for 20, 30 years,
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.680]   and they had this set of things they were trying to do,
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.040]   and now their life is just entirely devoted to counseling.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.160]   And they're overwhelmed.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.440]   And so I'm starting to see that.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.760]   I just had a conversation with a woman
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.440]   on the way over to campus, too,
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.000]   who had seen the same things at the high school level.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.880]   So there's just eyewitness testimony that we're seeing,
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.720]   there are studies that we're seeing, but it's a mountain.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.040]   We're talking about sleeplessness,
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.920]   we're talking about poor posture, sore necks,
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.160]   eye strain, headaches, hypertension.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.440]   We're talking about stress-induced breathing patterns.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.440]   Like when you get engaged with someone online
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.000]   and you gotta think of something witty or snarky,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.120]   like there's something happens to your body.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.560]   You know that feeling when you stop breathing.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.960]   Like there's something happens to you physically,
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.160]   and once you step back and say, "What's going on there?"
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.880]   You start to realize, okay, that's a physical effect
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.040]   of my smartphone use.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.960]   And so the stress-induced, shallow breathing patterns,
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.880]   when we get so engaged online, so locked in virtually,
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.000]   that our breathing patterns change.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.840]   So it goes on and on and on.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.720]   The thing that I started to look at is,
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.520]   okay, we can address all of those physical aspects
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.720]   of smartphone use, but I wanna go after
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.500]   the actual impulses behind what's driving us.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.200]   The cravings, the hopes, the wants, the hidden,
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.720]   sometimes lewd desires that we have
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.080]   for what we can find through our phones.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.200]   And to be quite honest, our phone represents
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.680]   sort of an expose of what we most want, okay?
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.760]   This is why we put codes on our screens
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.040]   to lock people out.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.560]   Because if you get into someone's smartphone,
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.800]   if you get into someone's search history,
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.400]   you get in and see what someone else has been looking at,
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.520]   you are deep diving into their heart.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.200]   We're talking about the most central,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.520]   driving heart issues in our lives emerge
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.480]   on what we see in our smartphone screens.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   That's why when it gets really personal,
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.440]   when we start talking about what we do with our phones,
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.200]   because some of the things that we do,
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.160]   we wouldn't want anybody else to know about.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.760]   That's what I'm after.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.760]   Like, what is it that drives us to those things?
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.440]   And so, yes, there's a mountain of evidence
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.560]   on the physical aspect of these dimensions,
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.840]   but there's also something more secret.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.640]   There's something more personal,
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.960]   more individually tailored to what is it
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.840]   that I'm looking for in my smartphone screen,
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.720]   and what does that say about me?
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.840]   - Yeah, that's good.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.440]   Let me talk a little bit specifically
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.560]   on the role of Christianity in this.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.120]   From your perspective, let me try to kind of
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.440]   paint a certain narrative where there's a college student,
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.520]   and let's say she goes to church on a regular basis,
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.320]   and she's just now becoming kind of aware
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.160]   of smartphone usage and wants to think about it more.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.400]   The idea is that if she wants to learn about things
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.080]   like prayer and Jesus and worship and those kinds of things,
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.280]   she'll go to church.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.960]   If she wants to learn about smartphone usage
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.280]   or the role of social media, she needs to go elsewhere.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.120]   What would you say to that narrative?
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.800]   Is there something true to it?
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.280]   How would you adjust that?
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.280]   Or what would you say to someone who is becoming aware
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.080]   of their smartphone usage in their relationship
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.800]   to the church at large?
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.640]   - Yeah.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.480]   - How do you understand that?
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.300]   - That's a great question.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.320]   I think the smartphone conversation is tied into something
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.520]   that's way bigger than just smartphones.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.960]   And that is that as a Christian looking to my kids
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.920]   and their future, I'm looking at things like nanotechnology
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.920]   and genetic modification and super babies are coming,
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.000]   and there's this super intelligence,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.200]   and there's artificial intelligence.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.720]   There's functional robots that'll be domesticated
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.600]   and brought into homes.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.280]   And then there's companion robots.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.280]   Like you start looking at the technology
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.800]   and what the tsunami of technological changes
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.320]   that are about to hit us is pretty, it's daunting.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.560]   So I step back and I look at like just smartphones
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.800]   are just the cusp of the wave
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.240]   of these other technological changes that are coming.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.040]   And so I asked myself like, okay,
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.120]   who are the experts to turn to?
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.840]   And honestly, I've come to the conclusion
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.440]   that it's like an all hands on deck kind of thing.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.480]   It is parents and pastors.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.960]   It is peers.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.720]   It is, if you can find experts in the fields
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.000]   who can speak on these things, find those experts,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.280]   journalists, whoever you can find
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.240]   that's talking about these things,
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.680]   pull them into the conversation
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.360]   and have a conversation like this.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.920]   Intentionally, this is not a lecture.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.600]   This is not the expert telling you what to do.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.000]   This is a conversation.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.680]   'Cause I need to hear from you.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.600]   You need to hear from me.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.200]   I need to hear from Jared.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.960]   It's really an all hands on deck scenario
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.280]   where we've got to figure this out
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.720]   for the sake of the next generation.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.800]   I'm looking at my kids and thinking,
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.480]   how do I help them in all of these things?
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.880]   And so honestly, I mean, parents, pastors,
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.920]   parents and pastors typically are on the front lines
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.640]   of seeing shifts and changes in behaviors.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.440]   And so they're gonna raise some flags
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.080]   even if they don't know really what to say beyond that.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.640]   But honestly, that's where I'm at.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.000]   I didn't write a book to be like the conclusive thing
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.160]   to say on smartphones.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.360]   I wanted it to open a conversation
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.280]   so that groups of people could read the book
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.920]   and then talk and hold each other accountable
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.960]   and think through these issues
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.200]   because I really do think,
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.040]   if I'm feeling that now with smartphones,
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.760]   those other technologies as they come
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.000]   and they're gonna come really quickly now,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.760]   it's just, we've got to come together as Christians
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.440]   to think through these things as a community.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.480]   - Yeah, it's systemic, right?
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.360]   So it touches on the psychological field,
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.720]   the philosophical field, the theological field.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.560]   - It does.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.720]   - There's a lot of people that are experts
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.120]   in these certain facets of smartphone usage
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.640]   because it's so systemic in our lives and touches each one.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.840]   And on that point, I wanna talk about spirituality
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.160]   and how that connects with this conversation.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.360]   Most people think or assume, I guess,
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.200]   that spirituality is important for Christianity, right?
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.080]   That's a big element.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.880]   You wanna take care of your spiritual nature
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.640]   and how that affects what you do
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.920]   with social media and smartphone usage.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.840]   But I also wanna talk about physicality
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.200]   and how important that is.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.320]   Is it important at all,
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.320]   just the role of being present, being physical?
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.280]   Is there a sense where physicality is important
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.120]   for the Christian worldview,
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.800]   the Christian point of view, number one?
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.320]   And number two, how does our smartphone usage
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.680]   relate to that importance, if it is important at all?
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.960]   Being present, being physical.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.680]   - Yeah, is the Christian faith embodied?
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.400]   Is embodiment an important thing for Christians?
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.040]   I would say absolutely it is.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.880]   It is essential to spirituality
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.600]   to recognize that we have this body that God has given us.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.160]   And what makes it, what I think raises the stakes here
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.760]   is when I look at the life of Christ.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.680]   Perhaps Christ could have died for sin
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.440]   in some virtual way, metaphorically within the Godhead.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.640]   He didn't have to leave heaven.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.440]   It would just be some sort of figurative kind of thing
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   that happened within the Godhead
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.720]   between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.800]   But that's not how God designed it.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.560]   God designed it so that His Son would be enfleshed.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.000]   He would come to earth in bodily form.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.920]   He would be begotten, not made.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.600]   And you see this enfleshment of Jesus,
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.920]   it just plays out in so many different areas.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.320]   Of course, you've got the virgin birth,
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.800]   which is a massive claim that Christians make,
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.480]   that Jesus was born to a virgin.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.240]   Then later, He would be baptized in water.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.880]   He would be submerged all the way underwater.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.120]   Right, Jared?
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.160]   - That's right.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:29.160]   - And that's how baptism is done, right?
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.880]   Baptist, Presbyterian.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:40.120]   Then you've got, in the storyline of Jesus,
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.000]   then you have Jesus in the desert temptations,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.720]   where He goes out, and He's gonna be tempted.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.280]   He's gonna be tempted in His hunger.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.920]   He has to be tempted in His hunger.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.480]   His body is part of that storyline.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.360]   He's going to have to feel hurt.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.640]   He is going to have to feel temptation,
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.200]   feel rejection with His body.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.480]   He is going to be filled with blood.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.480]   The Son of God will be filled with blood
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.880]   so that that blood could be shed, embodied.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.000]   Then He would be pinned to a cross by nails,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.560]   and He would shed His own body, His own blood for sinners.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.080]   And then His dead body would be taken down, put in a tomb,
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:29.240]   and a few days later, it would twitch and animate
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.080]   and come back to life in a resurrection.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.920]   Then His body -- this story's not over yet.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.600]   Then His body -- He's gonna walk around,
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.200]   and He's gonna show people His scars.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.240]   He's gonna eat food.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.760]   He really has a physical body after the resurrection.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.160]   And this physical body, then, is going to be raised up
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.000]   into the sky in the ascension.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.320]   And that physical body of Jesus is going to be enthroned
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.280]   in heaven as the King.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.560]   So you think of Queen Elizabeth's coronation service.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.240]   I mean, I can't imagine what it was like in heaven
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:04.760]   for Jesus, physical Jesus, ascended, enthroned in heaven.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.080]   And now Jesus is in heaven in a physical body right now,
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.080]   somewhere.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.840]   I don't know where He is, but He's somewhere in physical body
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.720]   with the scars still in His body, so that He can sympathize
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:22.120]   with me and the pain that I feel in this life and in this body.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.920]   That's how embodied the Christian faith is.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.000]   It's incredibly embodied.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.380]   And not only that, but when you believe in Jesus Christ,
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.000]   you become part of His body.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.400]   That's the very language, then, of the New Testament.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.160]   I mean, it just keeps getting more and more embodied.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.360]   Then, of course, when you profess faith in Christ,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.280]   after you profess faith in Christ, you're submerged fully under water
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.280]   in baptism, right, Jared?
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:50.960]   And then you come up out of the water, and that's a picture
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.460]   of the resurrection.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.560]   That's a portrayal of the resurrection our bodies will experience
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.920]   personally at some point in the future.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.240]   And in between all of that, then we celebrate the Lord's Supper.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.280]   The broken body, the shed blood of Jesus in bread and cup,
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.880]   we participate in that together.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.080]   So not only is Jesus' life and His whole storyline embodied,
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.320]   but our lives as Christians, those of us who have professed faith
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.400]   in Jesus Christ, we're now part of Christ's body,
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.080]   and we're living this out in a face-to-face kind of a way.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.300]   Now I know you can go to church in a virtual way, right?
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.080]   You can go to church, and it's like a Broadway show.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.440]   It's like a virtual experience.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.720]   You're watching a spectacle.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.720]   You're off in the distance.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.320]   You're not going to get your hands dirty.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.520]   I know you can do that.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.520]   You're not supposed to go to church that way, but you can.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:45.120]   But what the Bible calls us to is this face-to-face relationship
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.040]   with people that you'll never follow in your Twitter feed.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.040]   You'll never follow on Instagram.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.080]   We're talking about elderly people and poor people
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.360]   and people who are not in your socioeconomic class
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.600]   and people who are not like you and people who are not
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.640]   your same age and people who don't look like you
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.160]   and think like you.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.040]   That's what the church is made up of.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.880]   The church is made up of people with physical and mental
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.880]   disabilities that we need in our lives.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.800]   The church body is built with the elderly and with children,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   people you're not going to follow on Instagram.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   And so the church is this melding pot of this diversity
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.360]   that really is the key then to spiritual formation.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.560]   It's coming together with that diversity that looks
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.600]   totally different than our social media feeds.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.240]   And so is Christianity embodied?
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.200]   Yeah, it's embodied in every direction.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.160]   I mean, you can keep pressing into each of those elements,
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.760]   and it's embodied all over the place.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.680]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.880]   And we're going to have a body eternally, right?
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.280]   It's not something that we just strip away
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.080]   when we get to heaven.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.480]   That's going to be our goal.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.400]   So if you take that as a standard,
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.000]   then anything that's virtual is going
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.200]   to fall short of that, right?
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.040]   That's what smartphone usage and social media usage,
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.440]   you see an image that's not portraying reality.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.200]   And that's going to have an effect on how we see each other
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.160]   in our relationships, theologically, et cetera.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.280]   In Romans 8, you know this, and this is glorious.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   The creation is waiting.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.240]   The creation is waiting.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.640]   So creation is feeling something's wrong.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.360]   There's a brokenness because of sin,
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.920]   and everything is broken.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.440]   And then nothing works right, and the creation feels it.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.520]   The animal world knows it.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.120]   There's something broken.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.680]   And in Romans 8 in the New Testament,
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.080]   Paul says the creation is waiting for the moment
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.400]   when the church of God is resurrected to new life.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.880]   And in that moment, when all God's children
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.760]   are raised to new life, the creation is then
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.720]   raised to new life.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.160]   It's like a resurrection for the creation.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.480]   And so it's like the creation is waiting,
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.680]   waiting for that moment when the sons of God
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.320]   will be revealed in the resurrection.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.520]   And that's when we then participate in this creation
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.880]   in a new way, in a way that's totally transformed.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.120]   It's been remade, and the brokenness will be gone.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.160]   And the classmate that you can't stand, if they're in Christ
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.880]   and you're in Christ, you will be best friends forever
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.720]   in ways that you could never imagine being friends right now.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.600]   In a physical world, hiking the Himalayan mountains,
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.640]   some sort of recreated Himalayan mountains,
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.720]   and it's going to be gorge, but it is physical.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.400]   You're exactly right.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.040]   After the resurrection, it's not just a spiritual existence.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.760]   It is physical.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.800]   We know that because Jesus, when he was raised,
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.600]   had a physical body.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.320]   And so we know that the physical resurrection is not just
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.800]   some spiritual, ephemeral, floating in the clouds
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.880]   kind of a thing.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.880]   It is working and tilling the ground, getting hands dirty,
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.960]   and enjoying this earth in a way that's mind-boggling.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.560]   Presbyterians and Baptists together.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.680]   Yeah, amen.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.680]   Amen.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.480]   I do want to talk about social media, too.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.720]   And OK, so the way I want to focus this
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:03.800]   is products like Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, all those,
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.340]   they really are products, and they're
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.400]   being sold to us with kind of this promise of connection,
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.080]   connecting to people, connecting to family, friends, strangers
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.800]   even.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.200]   I want to talk about do they deliver
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.720]   on that promise in some way, and how do they
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.360]   fail to deliver on that promise?
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.560]   So what's the connection between social media
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.880]   and our connectivity to each other?
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.960]   What's the good, what's the bad that
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.360]   has come as a result of using those platforms?
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.520]   That's a great question.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.720]   We connect in so many different ways.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.400]   So when I live about a six-hour drive away from my parents,
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.320]   and so especially when the kids were little,
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.080]   like grandma and grandpa wanted to see the grandkids, right?
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.120]   And so we would use Skype.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.440]   We'd use some sort of a video service like that.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.760]   So that's a type of connecting where you already
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.280]   have a pre-existing relationship.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.040]   It's a real relationship.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.260]   And technology can help you extend those relationships
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.040]   even further.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.640]   You can cross distances.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.680]   So it's not just a virtual kind of connecting,
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.720]   but it's an extension.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.400]   And I think there's really healthy, useful ways
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.960]   of using technology in those ways.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.520]   There's also a polarizing connectivity, too,
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.520]   and we feel this in the sort of politicized climate
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.720]   that we live in.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.560]   And that is some prominent politician,
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.640]   who will go unnameless, will put a tweet out there,
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.760]   and everybody responds to it already.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.320]   They're already preloaded to trigger response
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.080]   to whatever's said, right?
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.320]   I can't believe you said this.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.680]   This is horrible, or I love this.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.560]   Retweet it.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.280]   And so there's a sort of like, we're triggered.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:49.280]   We're wired to respond to social media in a way that's just,
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.840]   it's completely polarized.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.720]   That's another way that we connect.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.400]   It's not necessarily healthy.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.800]   And then of course, there's a sort of a reflexive
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.000]   connection, too, in the sense that when you see something
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.080]   on Instagram or Snapchat, you're called to make
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.760]   an immediate decision about what you're looking at.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.600]   Do you like it?
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.480]   Not like it.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.320]   Here's an article.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.140]   Do you like it?
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:12.980]   Not like it.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:13.800]   Here's another image.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.640]   Do you like it?
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.460]   Not like it.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.880]   How much do you love it on Facebook?
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.600]   What kind of emoji are you gonna give it?
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.840]   There's an escalation of emojis.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.760]   And so there's less time for reflection,
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.880]   and now it's just reflexive.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.360]   Make an immediate judgment call on this piece of media.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.520]   That is shaping how we view every piece of media
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.320]   that comes into our phones.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.080]   Do we rejoice in it?
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.400]   Do we reject it?
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.080]   You're getting conditioned to make that
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.920]   immediate snap judgment.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.280]   And that's pretty significant.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.440]   That's really significant.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.940]   So that's another way that we connect.
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.120]   Very often times online, we're seeing each other
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.800]   in that reflexive moment.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.320]   We're watching each of us pass by each other,
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.040]   and there's sparks flying.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.440]   Rejoice, reject.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.600]   That's where we're meeting each other,
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.120]   in this tumultuous area of public discourse,
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.320]   and it's not really a discourse.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.440]   And so that's a lot of where we're at,
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.800]   is that just reflexive response.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.880]   And then there's, obviously,
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.400]   there's an engaged connectivity, too,
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.680]   where you can go into, even in Facebook,
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.080]   but you can go into group discussions,
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.780]   long, meaningful text relationships.
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.360]   You can send out significant texts to people that you love,
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.040]   and people you want to invest in.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.300]   There is a way to self-give online, too.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.720]   But you have to be intentional about that.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.220]   If you're going online to get something quick out of it,
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.080]   you're not gonna serve people in the way that you could.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.480]   And so there is a way of being engaged,
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.400]   and that's, you can use all sorts of platforms to do that,
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.920]   but it requires self-giving.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.880]   You have to say, "I'm going online
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.320]   "in order to invest in someone's life."
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.600]   And that, for a Christian, is where we want to ultimately be.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.520]   I'm going online, not so I can accumulate
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.800]   as many Instagram likes as I can.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.920]   I'm going online because I want to invest
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.640]   in other people's lives.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.320]   And that's a strategy decision
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.640]   you're gonna have to make in your life.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.560]   How much of this is really about me
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.360]   trying to generate self-glory,
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.880]   and how much of this is me going online
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.280]   and feeling as though I'm giving of myself
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.080]   to invest in someone else?
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.880]   So those are some of the ways that we connect.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.640]   There is the black mirror effect.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.000]   I mean, have you ever held your phone
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.240]   and your screen goes black,
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.880]   and you get a glimpse of yourself?
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.600]   And you're just like, you're startled.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.840]   You're like, look at yourself.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.040]   There's that black mirror kind of thing.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.960]   And a lot of what we do on social media
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.560]   is that sort of black mirror.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.920]   It's narcissistic.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.480]   It's just me trying to feed my own ego.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.280]   It's me trying to get approval.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.520]   It's me trying to get other people to like me.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.120]   It's sick, but it's that black mirror kind of like,
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.160]   really what I'm trying to see online is myself.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.560]   And so that again is why, you know,
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.440]   the local church is irreplaceable
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.120]   because you get into these relationships
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.040]   with people in a local church,
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.000]   and it's just, it's gonna change you
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.680]   because it's gonna call you out of yourself.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.720]   You can't hide behind some edited picture of yourself.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.240]   You can't scrub certain parts of your life away.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.720]   As you meet face-to-face with people,
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.960]   you are who you are face-to-face.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.120]   It's very exposing, but it's important.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.280]   It's really important for us to experience that.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.680]   And so it's this weird thing, social media is so weird.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.360]   Like we wanna be known, and we also wanna hide.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.640]   We wanna be known and we wanna hide at the same time.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.120]   This reminds me of David Foster Wallace's novel,
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.360]   "Infinite Jest."
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.920]   I don't recommend reading that book
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.840]   unless you wanna punish yourself.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.200]   It's a hard book to read,
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.800]   but he's got some really insightful things in that book.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.960]   One of the things that he talks about
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.000]   is the transition in his society that he's created
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.600]   from the traditional phone that you pick up,
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.440]   you know, from the wall with the little squiggly,
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:50.120]   you know, and transitioning from that to the video phone.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.800]   So everybody was going towards these video phones.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.320]   And what all the characters in the book were finding out
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.840]   is that answering a video phone
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.640]   is not like answering the phone.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.560]   You can answer the phone and just be sort of like half there,
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.640]   you know, half attentive, doing something else,
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.440]   fiddling over here, and they wouldn't even know.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.040]   With the video phone, what the characters realize
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.480]   is you've gotta like make eye contact with the video.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.720]   You've gotta show that you're completely engaged.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.440]   And so what David Foster Wallace,
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.880]   he looked to the future and he said,
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.600]   I could foresee in an age of video calls like this
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.600]   that people would buy little filters
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.840]   that they would put over the video camera
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.640]   that would make them look all, you know,
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.400]   trim and healthy and whatever.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.240]   And you could just see the mouth moving, you know,
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.840]   or something like, and so like the person
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.000]   would get a very glamorous vision of what you look like,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.480]   but it was just a filter.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.760]   Because what he said was answering the video phone
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.880]   was like answering the door.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.920]   Like you're like fixing your hair
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.040]   and throwing on more clothes
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.720]   and putting on lipstick and prosthetics and whatever.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.320]   You know, like you have to,
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.680]   it's not like answering the phone.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.400]   It's, and he says it in a way
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.120]   only David Foster Wallace could say.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.400]   So there's all these paradoxes
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.640]   of what it means to live in this digital age.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.840]   We wanna be seen and we wanna hide at the same time.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.680]   Even when it comes to,
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.040]   we've talked a little bit about video and Skype
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.200]   and one of the realities is
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.440]   when it comes to eye to eye contact,
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.440]   you know, looking someone in the eye,
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.960]   you can't do that on Skype.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.480]   You can't do that on FaceTime.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.080]   You can look at the presentation of yourself on the screen,
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.640]   which is typically where our eyes go, right?
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.680]   Let's be honest.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.520]   It's like a mirror.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.760]   We're like making sure we look presentable.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.160]   That David Foster Wallace saw that coming a long time ago.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.800]   Or we look at the person's face on the screen, right?
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.840]   That we're talking to.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.000]   Or we look directly into the camera, right?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.560]   But if two people look directly into the camera
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.560]   at the same time, where are they looking?
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.640]   Above and over the other person.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.040]   So there's no way to make eye contact in Skype.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.600]   You know, it's just one of those little subtle things
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.440]   that we've gotta think about and be like,
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.360]   okay, there's no replacement.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.960]   There's no digital replacement for eye contact.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.640]   You can't replicate that in Skype.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.000]   So all that to say, I think David Foster Wallace
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.640]   was a prophet of the emoji.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.960]   Specifically the bitmoji of speaking through
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.280]   a moving avatar.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.360]   I think David Foster Wallace saw that in 1986.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.040]   - Let's stay on social media and self-worth
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.720]   and talk about that a little bit.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.680]   Social media can be quantified really easily.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.560]   You can see how many Instagram followers you have,
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.240]   how many Twitter followers,
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.160]   and you can compare that to other people really well.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.240]   It's public, it's there for everybody to see.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.400]   And the only other comparison that I thought of
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.080]   was like financial wealth.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.200]   You can't see, usually, people's bank accounts,
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.960]   but you can kinda see indicators of how well off they are.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.920]   Or at least you can sometimes.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.600]   So I was thinking, what are some of the ways
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.200]   that we can compare like social media wealth
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.040]   with financial wealth and how those things relate
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.200]   to our own sense of self-worth,
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.400]   our value as it relates to how many likes we get,
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.720]   how many followers we get.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.960]   What are some of the connections there?
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.800]   What's the right way to think about self-worth
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.640]   and social media and those kinds of things?
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.440]   - We're living in what's called now the attention market.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.880]   The attention market.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.800]   The commodity that you have, yes, you have money,
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.480]   you have money to spend,
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.840]   but increasingly, the valuable commodity that you offer
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.680]   is your attention.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.240]   You have attention to give.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.960]   Attention is what translates into YouTube views.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.280]   Attention is what translates into likes, snap streaks.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.000]   Like your attention is what generates
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.160]   all of those things in social media.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.080]   So that is a precious commodity
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.760]   that huge, massive corporations are after.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.920]   They want more of that commodity of your attention.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.280]   And when they win more of your attention,
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.600]   they gain valuations in the billions.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.760]   This is why Instagram is worth 20 billion.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.720]   This is why Facebook is worth 500 billion.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:09.200]   They have found a way to capture that valuable commodity,
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.760]   which is your time, my time.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.560]   So I think it's helpful that using money
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.320]   as an introduction to this question,
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.800]   I think is really insightful
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.360]   because it really is a commodity.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.960]   Attention is a commodity like money is a commodity.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.520]   Now, does having more Instagram followers
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.080]   make you more socially powerful?
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.960]   It does, in a sense.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.800]   It does.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.680]   The more attention you can command
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.640]   means the more powerful you are as a person.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.960]   That's just the way it is in this economy.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.160]   If you can get 100,000 people
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.800]   subscribed to your YouTube channel,
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.400]   you can probably make a full-time living
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.600]   just off that YouTube channel
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.320]   because you can convert so much
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.000]   of that commodity of attention toward yourself,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.280]   and that's power that you can use to sell to advertisers.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.800]   So we just have to be real about the nature
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.480]   of what it means to live inside of this attention economy.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.720]   And that's a realization
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.000]   that sort of came out of the 12 Ways book,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.640]   and that's what generated the newer book
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.360]   on competing spectacles is this.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.120]   The reality is that commodity market
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.600]   is having a tremendous impact on you
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.160]   and where you spend your own time
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.600]   and how you view yourself.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.960]   So in some sense, you can compare yourself
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.040]   on Instagram, you can say,
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.920]   oh, I've got more followers than my friend
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.640]   or my enemy or my frenemy,
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.720]   whoever it is, you can compare.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.960]   Like, this is right for comparison, isn't it?
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.520]   And it's so vain when you think about it.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.200]   Like, us comparing ourselves to other people
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.360]   and how many followers they have
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.080]   and how many likes they got on that image,
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.800]   and I should've gotten more likes on this
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.920]   and my image was better than,
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.160]   the comparison game just gets fed by
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.200]   this tabulation of approval
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.560]   that we all latch onto as if it means
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.000]   something significant, and it doesn't.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.040]   It really doesn't in a lot of ways,
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.440]   unless you're being mindful about those relationships.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.720]   Now, we love using ratings.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.800]   Ratings are important, like five-star ratings
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.720]   are important, right?
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.560]   I don't wanna drive with an Uber driver
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.880]   who's got a one-star rating.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   No, that's a death trap, right?
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.760]   You're not gonna buy a product on Amazon
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.160]   that has two out of five stars.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.360]   No way, that's a clunker.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.040]   You wouldn't buy that.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.480]   So, even college professors are getting ranked now,
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.040]   like websites, like you guys know that.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.240]   Be kind, be kind to your professors, please.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.240]   That cannot be easy.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.160]   Now, here's what's crazy.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.600]   When I was researching my book,
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.960]   I realized there was an app in 2014
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.360]   that was launched called Peeple,
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:44.360]   P-E-E-P-L-E, Peeple, like peephole, peephole, okay?
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:49.000]   This app was designed to offer users the chance
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.040]   to offer one to five-star ratings
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.760]   of the people that they know, okay?
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:59.760]   Friends, coworkers, and former romantic partners, okay?
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.960]   We're not talking about Uber drivers,
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.560]   we're not talking about Amazon products,
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.280]   we're not even talking about professors.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.520]   We're talking about private individuals
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.440]   being given a one to five rating in public.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.840]   What could go wrong, right?
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.880]   What could go wrong?
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.640]   Well, here's what the Washington Post called Peeple.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.600]   They called it inherently invasive, objectifying,
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.800]   reductive, and a source of stress and anxiety
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.960]   for even a slightly self-conscious person.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.520]   Even more, Peeple generated a platform
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.960]   that would encourage invasion of privacy
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.520]   and even harassment.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.640]   At the very least, it produced the feeling
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.320]   of being watched and judged at all times
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:48.320]   by an objectifying gaze to which you did not consent.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.280]   Okay?
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.960]   Now, they revamped the app after 2014,
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.800]   and that debacle, and Washington Post
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.560]   grilled them rightfully, and now it's like,
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.400]   I don't know, you can rate your workplaces and stuff.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.120]   It's not what it was designed to be.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.640]   But could you imagine that?
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.720]   Your friend's giving you a public rating,
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.960]   one to five, on how good of a friend you are.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:13.440]   We render things down into a number of desirability.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.120]   Tinder, Tinder, the app Tinder
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.680]   has been doing this for years.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.760]   They have a desirability ranking for every profile.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.760]   So based upon whether people swipe left, swipe right,
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.240]   there's this tabulation, there's an algorithm
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.680]   that gives you a desirability rating
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.760]   in your Tinder profile, which is kept private.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.600]   Okay?
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.240]   Now, a few journalists have been given their number,
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.040]   and they all regret that they got it.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.800]   All of them regret it, okay?
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.000]   'Cause it was not flattering.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.320]   (audience laughs)
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.840]   So, like, tabulations of approval,
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.640]   it's just the nature of this world.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.880]   What's really scary is China is now playing around with a,
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.760]   it's called the social credit system.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.360]   I don't know if any of you have heard of this.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.400]   It's a reputation rating, a reliability rating,
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.200]   and a credit score wrapped into one.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.040]   Okay?
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.520]   Now, if you watch a certain TV show,
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.240]   you've seen that episode, and what that leads to, okay?
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.960]   My Christian conscience, I can't promote the television show,
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.280]   but, like, there's an episode of television
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.040]   that, like, explores what this would look like
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.480]   when your desirability rating, your reliability rating,
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.480]   and your credit score were all wrapped up into one number,
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.960]   and it's frightening.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.800]   It is frightening.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.640]   It creates an oppressive caste system of popularity.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.800]   So, whenever you have a numbers game,
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.400]   you have a game that can be gamed.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.320]   Justin Timberlake can go out and buy
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.440]   a million extra Instagram followers if he wants to.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.760]   Several celebrities have been caught, right,
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.040]   boosting their numbers.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.800]   If you have a numbers game, that game can be gamed, okay?
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.000]   So, don't put a whole lot of stock into it.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.800]   - When you see someone who is a self-proclaimed influencer,
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.040]   that always kind of cracks me up,
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.720]   because I think, what are you influencing people
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.920]   to actually do?
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.240]   Follow other people that you know, dress a certain way?
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.440]   What's the influence for?
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:07.000]   And I think just that vague influencer title
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.320]   doesn't tell me a whole, I'm a PhD in philosophy,
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.880]   so I think of big questions, and I think,
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.400]   you haven't influenced me to think about
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.360]   one single solitary thing ever.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.080]   But, am I thinking about that in the wrong way,
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.680]   or, when you see someone as a social media influencer,
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.800]   what does that mean to you?
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.200]   What do you think that means to most people,
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.960]   and how should we think about that whole status?
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.680]   - Yeah, so it means that they're wealthy
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.120]   in the commodity of attention,
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.160]   so people have given them lots of coins of attention,
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.680]   and they've turned that, if they're smart,
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:38.960]   they've turned that into advertising revenue and money.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.600]   If you can game the system, if you can play video games
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.640]   all day and livestream it and make a million dollars
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.480]   in a month, go for it.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.440]   I mean, that's, Ninja is brilliant.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.560]   (audience laughs)
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:54.040]   At some point, you have to just admire what he's done.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.240]   But yeah, you have to ask the question, as a Christian,
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.840]   ultimately, the question comes down to,
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.240]   how am I influencing others, and why?
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.520]   Why, why, why?
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.760]   Is it for me, is it for someone else?
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.280]   So, this is why, can you hand me the book?
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.960]   This is why, okay, so, I'm gonna go geeky for a minute.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.600]   If you have the sampler for 12 Ways Your Phone
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.160]   Is Changing You, I think you should have
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.360]   a table of contents.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.960]   So I have 12 ways, which are 12 chapters.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.120]   This is all structured chiastically.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.560]   Anybody know what a chiastic structure is yet?
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.800]   Okay, this is what geeky writers do in their basement
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.640]   when they're writing books, they're like,
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.440]   ah, let's write a chiastic structure,
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.760]   and then we'll talk to college students at Texas A&M,
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.760]   and they'll be impressed one day.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.080]   So chapter one, we're addicted to distraction.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.400]   That's half of chapter 12.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.880]   So we're addicted to distraction,
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.280]   and we lose our place in time.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.320]   Those two chapters are tied together
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.160]   in a chiastic structure.
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.160]   So chapter one and 12 develop each other,
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.080]   although they are distinct, okay?
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.560]   Then chapter two and 11 develop one another.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.480]   We ignore flesh and blood, and we become harsh
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.080]   to one another, those two tie together,
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.960]   they develop one another.
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.840]   Then chapters three and 10, we crave immediate approval,
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.480]   and we fear missing out.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.760]   That develops, those two chapters develop together.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.080]   Chapters four and nine, we lose our literacy,
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.520]   we lose meaning, those two are tied together.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.280]   Chapters five and eight, we feed on the produced,
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.200]   and we get comfortable and seek revices.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.920]   Those are tied together, which means,
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.040]   at the very middle of a chiastic structure,
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.520]   what do you have, class?
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.360]   What do you have?
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.600]   You have the main point, right?
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.120]   This is what I'm getting at.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.440]   So the main point of the chiastic structure in my book
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.280]   is six and seven, we become like what we like,
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.800]   which is a chapter about idolatry.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.520]   We have false gods that we become like in our thinking.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.440]   And then chapter seven is we get lonely
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.760]   because we're not self-giving.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.080]   We're not loving other people,
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.320]   so we grow lonely in our social media use.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.920]   Even if we have thousands of followers,
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.600]   we get lonely because we're not actually serving anyone,
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.200]   we're not loving anyone.
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.160]   So loving God and loving neighbor are chapters six and seven.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.640]   Love God, love neighbor.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.480]   That's essentially the essence of chapter six and seven,
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.080]   which is the summation, Jesus says, of basically the Bible.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.480]   Love God, love neighbor.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.840]   It's what it boils down to.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:14.920]   So chapter six is treasure God above all things,
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.160]   and then chapter seven is out of that love,
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.640]   out of that overflow of delight in who God is, you serve.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.280]   And that, I think, is so key.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.960]   That's why I put it in the middle of the book,
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.600]   because this is what Christians
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.200]   have to offer this discussion.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.560]   Social media offers a false god.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.520]   It offers approval that will not fill the hole in your life
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.720]   that is designed to be filled by God.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.080]   It's not going to.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.200]   We call it idolatry,
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.240]   to try and stuff that huge hole in your life
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.680]   to find satisfaction in something in this world
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.720]   that will make me happy.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.480]   Maybe I got 75 likes on that Instagram post yesterday.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.840]   What if I post a better image?
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.160]   Maybe I'll get 125 today.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:00.920]   And maybe if I get close to a celebrity at the concert,
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.840]   maybe I'll get 400.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.880]   How can I get more and more likes on Instagram?
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   That kind of desire is never going to fill your heart.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.880]   Ever. Ever.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:16.280]   And so what is it, then, that is there to fill that hole?
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.240]   And it is, quite simply, the gospel comes in and says,
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.720]   here is the Son of God, Jesus Christ,
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.680]   who is so beautiful, so glorious,
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.560]   that the Father, in that baptism that we were talking about,
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.880]   when Jesus was baptized,
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.680]   by going all the way under the water and coming out,
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.680]   Jesus...
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.680]   The Father is proclaiming,
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.680]   this is my beloved Son.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.160]   This is my precious Son.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:49.080]   This is the most glorious thing you will ever see.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.520]   You will never see anything on Instagram
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.240]   that comes close to this.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:57.280]   I'm going to rip the heavens apart and speak audibly.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   That's God talking.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:03.680]   Right?
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.520]   So we take our cue from that and say,
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.920]   Jesus is the most satisfying thing in the universe.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.480]   What is that hole for?
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.160]   That hole there is for us to taste and see how good Jesus is.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.120]   And we draw towards Him, and we believe in Him,
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.840]   and we rejoice in Him.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.280]   And then it's out of that overflow of loving Christ
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.520]   that we then pour our lives out in self-sacrifice.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.720]   And that may mean you don't need a smartphone.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.760]   That may mean you don't need Instagram.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:35.400]   That may be that you can find ways to serve other people online.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.520]   I don't know what it will be,
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:39.120]   but there will be an overflow that will fill up
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.080]   all those ticks of approval that you were chasing before.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.000]   There's something greater that will explode
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.680]   those things out of your life in such a way
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.440]   that you'll think, "That was so vain, chasing those things."
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.800]   And you'll be given a new joy.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.600]   And out of that joy, you then live in self-sacrifice.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.280]   That's the Christian gospel.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.040]   And that's why those chapters are the center of the book,
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.760]   because I think that really is the key.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.960]   The key to being wise with a smartphone
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:12.720]   comes down to understanding what is your purpose on this earth.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.880]   That's how small of a question it is.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.400]   It really is.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.840]   You have to answer that question to find purpose
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.240]   when it comes to your media, your friendships, whatever it is.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.080]   What's your life for?
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:23.600]   That's good.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.400]   I think that's a perfect point to transition for your questions.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.120]   There is a microphone right there.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:35.320]   If you do have questions, feel free to get up and just get in line there.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.480]   Thank you for coming out today.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.040]   We really appreciate hearing from you.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:42.360]   My question is, you mentioned earlier about the emergence of the new technologies,
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.360]   the new economies, and all that stuff.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.240]   What do you think has the greatest potential for good
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.280]   amongst what we're looking forward to?
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.600]   What do you think has the greatest potential for destruction?
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.920]   Wow.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.680]   That's a big question.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:00.400]   I think genetic modification-- you're talking about those big categories
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.400]   that I threw out earlier.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:04.200]   Yeah, when I think of-- I think genetic modification is
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   the one that scares me.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:10.880]   How CRISPR is becoming so mainstream and easier and cheaper to do,
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:17.560]   and the boldness of pseudoscientists to create superhumans,
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.320]   designer babies, that frightens me probably more than anything else.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.440]   I think the other things we can handle-- but I don't know what you do
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.840]   with a genetically modified human being that has a super intelligence.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.280]   Like, I don't know.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:36.680]   Like, once the genie is out of that bottle, that's a unique kind of thing.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:40.640]   So that probably, for me, is the thing that is most frightening.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:46.160]   Yeah, the greatest potential for good is the tremendous power
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:52.920]   of digital communication to reach around the world.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:57.360]   I sit in my office in Minneapolis, and I have the joy of writing books,
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.640]   and then those books go out, and then those books get translated
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.760]   into languages, and then I start getting emails from people
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.320]   across the world who speak a different language.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.280]   I get emails, and I have to copy and paste them
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.040]   into Google Translate to read them.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.040]   That blows my mind.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:14.560]   I mean, that blows my mind, the fact that I can say things
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:18.240]   and write things that are not only read across the English-speaking world,
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.680]   but then get translated.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.320]   And I'm not some unique voice.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.400]   That's happening all over the place.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.840]   So the power of digital communication and digital media is--
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.280]   I mean, it is such a powerful force for good.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:35.680]   So whether you're a poet, a painter, a spoken word artist, a hip-hop artist,
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:40.440]   whatever it is God has called you to do, find ways to use digital means
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.440]   to get your message out.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.080]   And that's part of the story of 12 Ways is realizing there's a lot
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.440]   of really powerful tools available now.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:53.840]   I mean, you can make a documentary with basically an iMac.
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.600]   I mean, you can create a music album.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.840]   You have some decent kind of a recording studio.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.120]   You can make your own album.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:06.960]   Those kind of tools are incredible in what God can do through Christians
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:07.480]   in the world.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:11.200]   I'm just seeing-- I'm just in awe of the power of digital technology
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.640]   because it seems limitless.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.480]   Thank you very much.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.000]   Thank you.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.640]   Tony, thanks so much for coming out tonight.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.160]   I really enjoyed getting to hear from you.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.680]   I enjoyed reading your book as well.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.200]   Thank you.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:20.880]   It's excellent.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:21.720]   Thanks for writing.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.920]   I just wanted to ask if you wouldn't mind sharing some
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.920]   of your personal habits, things that you have found in effort
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.160]   to lead a more disconnected, but still--
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.040]   I realize you have a smartphone and an iPad.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.600]   So what are some of the habits you've found helpful?
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.640]   Yeah, a bunch of things I've learned over the years.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.320]   Number one is get your hands dirty.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.120]   No, like literally get your hands dirty.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.360]   One of the things that smartphone addicts are doing now
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.040]   is taking up pottery.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.120]   So you get locked into pottery for a couple of hours working on something.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.560]   And what do you do with your hands?
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.400]   Your hands are a cupboard, right?
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.880]   You can't do anything with your phone, right?
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.960]   So that's a helpful way to do it.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:57.800]   Do woodworking.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:01.800]   Find activities that will get your hands dirty.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.880]   One of the things I do with my smartphone is I gray the screen out
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.160]   so there's no color.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.800]   Any of you tried that before?
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.680]   OK, if you have an iPhone--
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:13.120]   I don't know how this works on other-- pull out your iPhone real quick.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.000]   This is not a trick.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.400]   This is not a trick, I promise.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.160]   It's not a trick.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:21.560]   I'm not going to lambaste you for doing this, I promise.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.520]   So go to Settings.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.920]   Go to Settings.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.760]   Go to Settings.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.920]   Go to General.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.280]   Settings, General.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   Accessibility.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.680]   See Accessibility.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.640]   And then click on Display Accommodations.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.520]   Color Filters.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.360]   You see Color Filters?
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.680]   Turn that on.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.640]   And then click Grayscale.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.520]   OK, you see that?
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.640]   Now your phone is black and white.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.960]   Now there's a rumor-- and I can't confirm this-- but there's a rumor
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.320]   that that will enhance your battery life, too.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.520]   But here's what it does, primarily.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:01.880]   When you lose color on your home screen, do you notice what happens
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:05.560]   to those number bubbles, those app badges with the numbers on them?
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.400]   They just get muted.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:11.080]   Instead of being blue and punching at you, like, you got to do this,
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.760]   you're behind, you're behind, it just mutes.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.640]   And so it does that with all the colors.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:20.120]   I find that to be a really helpful little trick, that the smartphone does
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.400]   not grab my attention.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.840]   Now, Instagram pictures are going to be black and white, right?
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.120]   So you're used to a certain kind of image.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.600]   But I find that really helpful.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.680]   So I do that.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.600]   I use the Screen Time app.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.240]   So all my kids and my wife, we all have a Screen Time app,
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.200]   and we're comparing.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.880]   It's a goofy app right now.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.000]   It doesn't do all the things you would want it to do,
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.640]   but it's going to get better, I think.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.440]   And so just having accountability with, here's
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:45.720]   how much time I spent on social media and letting other people see it,
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:46.720]   that's helpful.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:50.920]   Deleting apps, like getting rid of apps regularly is helpful.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:55.400]   Like apps that are not useful to your life, just get rid of them.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.560]   If they're distracting, get rid of them.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.560]   That's really helpful.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:03.960]   And then I, twice a year for 10 days each, I do a digital fast.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.360]   And so now I have an online job, so there's
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.480]   a certain amount of email that I have to do,
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.720]   certain amount of things that I just have to do online.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.920]   But otherwise, all of my social media, my smartphone,
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.960]   those things are off for 10 days, twice a year.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.320]   Usually they coordinate with a retreat that my wife and I take,
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:23.560]   just to read and plan things.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:27.680]   But twice a year, 10 days offline.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.600]   Those first two days are really hard.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.880]   They're really excruciating.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.160]   And then you get to day three, and it's like, OK, I can do this.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:38.960]   And then by day four and five, your life is--
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.920]   it gives you a new perspective on your life.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:44.760]   And so I talk about some other strategies in the book of how to do that.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:50.000]   But those detox fasts are so critical for me and for my wife.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.440]   I just have to do them.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:53.800]   And part of what I have to do is get back to long books
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:58.000]   and maintain my linear concentration, because that's
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   the muscle that gets weaker and weaker with my use of digital media.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.040]   So I hope what you hear from me is that I continue
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.560]   to use those fasting periods of 10 days twice a year,
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:12.320]   because I still see it as a problem in my own life that I've got to combat.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.520]   And I've got to take time away and say, God,
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.560]   you are greater than the approval that I'm seeking online.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.720]   You are more satisfying than that affirmation that I'm looking for online.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.360]   So those are a few things.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:25.200]   Thanks.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.280]   Just a quick answer, are there no women who have questions at all?
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.960]   I find that hard to believe.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.480]   I appreciate your questions, just trying to get a little bit of a mix here.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.560]   I can try to get in touch with my tone and accent.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:42.480]   Well, howdy, Tony, and thank you for coming.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:42.980]   Thanks.
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:48.480]   I'm Robodistan Christian, and in my three-and-a-half-year career
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:52.160]   here at A&M, I've reached maybe a dozen points where I've said, OK,
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.960]   social media, primarily YouTube, I've said, I'm investing so much into this.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.160]   I'm watching it all the time.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:53:58.960]   I'm wasting my time.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.720]   I'm not doing the homework I should be doing, all this kind of stuff.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.920]   I'm avoiding my friends.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:06.840]   And I've said, OK, you know, scripture says, if your hand causes you to sin,
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.360]   cut it off.
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:12.800]   And I've tried fasting for about a month away from YouTube, whatever.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:18.120]   There are so many bad things to watch on YouTube, so many avenues.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.080]   And I wanted to get rid of them.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.320]   I hate them.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.800]   And I've tried to cut them out of my life.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.520]   But every time I'm faced with the decision to cut YouTube out,
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.720]   there are ways to block it and all this kind of stuff.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:35.320]   I'm faced with dropping both those and things like, before I found the app,
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:39.240]   Ask Pastor John, and several pastors I've listened to through YouTube.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:42.880]   And I've been deterred from dropping it because I think, well,
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.840]   I need this stuff, this good stuff.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:48.600]   But it does keep the negative avenues open.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:56.080]   My question is, I have read about, do you think it's safe for the church,
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:03.640]   individual churches and Christian organizations to dabble in this social
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:10.880]   media, YouTube area, in such a way that keeps it relevant and vital to people
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.600]   like me?
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.280]   - That's a legitimate question.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.720]   That is a legitimate question.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.800]   Thank you.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:22.720]   So if we personalize the question for a second, anytime I text someone,
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.000]   I'm obligating them in a certain way, right?
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.640]   So the whole system runs on the least controlled user, right?
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.440]   Really?
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:37.280]   The least controlled social media or smartphone user, the most addicted
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:42.440]   smartphone user who's texting, who's direct messaging, all these people who
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:47.120]   now are obligated to respond, there's a sense in which we're projecting
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:50.600]   our misuse of the smartphone onto other people.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:56.920]   Whereas if you restrain yourself, that also has an impact on others, right?
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.880]   So like, I have this...basically, I have a rule.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.760]   I don't text anyone between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.840]   It's just, I cut it off at 9 p.m., on at 8 a.m.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:11.080]   And everybody in my world just realizes that's the reality of it.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:15.400]   And what I've noticed is friends and coworkers who traditionally would text
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:19.760]   after 9 p.m., they start doing that less and less, right?
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.280]   Because I'm not going to respond.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:24.640]   And so it could be, even in a group context where those conversations aren't
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.040]   going to happen because they know Tony's not going to reply.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:31.920]   So my decision to not tweet or use any social media between 9 p.m.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:37.240]   and 8 a.m. has a rippling effect on the people around me, okay?
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:41.440]   Now, if I was texting them at 11 p.m., that would also have a negative impact.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:48.720]   I think that's kind of what you're getting at, but more at the larger level of, like,
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:53.360]   if we're putting out so much content that's so compelling, that's driving people
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:58.280]   to YouTube, do we bear some responsibility for the dumb videos that show up in the
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.840]   stream on the right bar?
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:56:59.960]   Right?
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:03.000]   Because you're watching something that's, like, so edifying.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.560]   It's like Tim Keller is, like, explaining the meaning of life in five minutes, right?
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:14.880]   And then it's, like, "Seinfeld's Funniest Five Bloopers" is, like, right there.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.200]   And, like, now it's competing.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.680]   Like, you can't compete with that.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.160]   Like, "Seinfeld's Bloopers" is, like, I want to click on that as soon as possible.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.080]   It's not fair.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:28.760]   So the question is then, does feeding that main box of edifying content, isn't that just
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.040]   driving and feeding the whole system?
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:35.280]   And that, I mean, that's a significant question that I don't have an answer to.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.000]   But you're right.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.920]   There is some level of accountability when we're driving, as Christian ministries are
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:45.760]   driving people into YouTube for edification, are we responsible for then what they see
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.240]   following?
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.080]   I don't have a simple answer for that.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.200]   I really don't.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:55.680]   I do foresee in the not-too-distant future that Christian content could very likely be
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.800]   banned from certain platforms.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:04.760]   We've had a prominent video on YouTube that I thought was very tactfully done that was
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.520]   banned by YouTube.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.600]   We fought to reinstate it, and we got it reinstated.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:14.840]   But I foresee YouTube as a platform making calls about what Christians can and can't
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.000]   say online.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:22.120]   And so Christians then retreating into third-party hosting services that won't be using a Vimeo
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.320]   or a YouTube, I foresee that in the future.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:27.320]   You may not have to worry about that.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.320]   Might not.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:33.000]   I think Christian ministries that are smart right now are already developing some sort
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.200]   of self-hosting site for their video and audio content.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   Thank you.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.200]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   Thank you for coming, by the way.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.200]   So in Scripture, in the parallel of the sower, we see how the sower goes around and spreads
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   the seeds everywhere.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.200]   So what do you say is the role of social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram and
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.200]   Twitter and all that in evangelism?
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.200]   And how do you say we should go about that in a way that seeks the glory of God rather
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.200]   than our own self-fulfillment?
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.200]   That's awesome.
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.200]   I mean, that's the right question to ask.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.200]   You've got to ask that question first.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:59:09.760]   And really, that's the driving part of my whole book and what I'm here to do is to encourage
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.640]   you to think about that.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:12.960]   What is it that God has called you to do?
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:18.080]   If you're an evangelist, you have so many opportunities online to share the gospel.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:20.920]   At least to maybe sow seeds in people's lives.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.680]   You can't do all evangelism online.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:27.440]   You're going to have to meet people face to face, but there is some extension of evangelism
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.000]   that you can do in social media.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.360]   And see, this is the beauty of it.
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:35.420]   Once you see, like, okay, God has called me to be an evangelist and to love other people
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:39.120]   by sharing the gospel with them, and it's going to hurt and it's self-sacrifice.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.320]   This is not about my glory.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:41.760]   It's about his glory.
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:45.560]   Once you realize that, then God starts opening up doors of like, okay, use Instagram for
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.080]   this purpose and use Facebook for this purpose and use YouTube for this purpose.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:54.280]   If he calls you into those fields, it's just, you know, the fields are white and the workers
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:55.600]   are few.
[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:00.400]   The number of people who are going to use social media in a self-sacrificing way, in
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:06.120]   a way that they come offline and they're like, they feel spent because they gave themselves.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.880]   They poured themselves out for others.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:14.160]   They didn't go to social media and get puffed up in this vain way, but they go there and
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.160]   self-give.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.840]   And you're in a great place.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:17.840]   Just keep praying.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.880]   God, open up doors, use Facebook and then see who comments and then engage in those
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.160]   people privately.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.280]   Like you can use it in so many different ways, so many different ways, but you're asking
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.200]   the exact right question and you just keep pressing into that and God will start opening
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.760]   up doors for you.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:41.760]   Hi, thank you so much for coming all the way down to Texas.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:47.360]   So I recognize in my life some of my peers and siblings that are of direct effect of
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.360]   social media and their YouTube habit and I can tell it's affecting their self-worth and
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.720]   it's affecting how they're able to interact face-to-face.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.360]   Is there a proper way that I should go about like helping them recognize that or are there
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.800]   any do's or don'ts that you've experienced in like helping other people recognize that
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.680]   their addictions are to social media and to YouTube are a detriment to their lives?
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.320]   It's really something that they have to come to terms with on their own.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320]   How old are the individuals?
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320]   My sister is 16.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.320]   Oh, 16.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.320]   Okay, so she's older.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.640]   Boy, I mean, honest conversations are really important.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.400]   You have to say like, "Hey, I've noticed these trends in your life.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.880]   I don't think this is helpful.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.760]   I don't think this is beneficial."
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.300]   The smartphone book that I wrote is really me coming to terms with all of the facets
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:33.760]   of what drives me to my phone personally.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:39.760]   And so once I became more clear about what desires were inside of me driving me to my
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.160]   phone, now I can parent my kids and say, "Hey, you know what?
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:49.080]   I know that desire to be liked and to be popular and to be loved online is so powerful.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.080]   It's so potent."
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:55.600]   It's even got, I mean, it's sparking the dopamine in their brain, right?
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:01.040]   So this dopamine molecule in the brain, it says, "Yes, do more of that."
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.680]   So it's related to sugar, right?
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.240]   You eat sugar and your dopamine is like, "Yes, do that more.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.240]   Eat more sugar," right?
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.280]   So it's pleasurable to have sugar.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:19.320]   The same exact response happens with sex, with cocaine, with heroin, with tobacco, alcohol,
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.320]   those kinds of things.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.840]   Your brain is telling you, "Oh, more, more, more."
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.200]   And you shouldn't have more, more, more, but your brain is telling you more, more, more.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.720]   The same thing happens with social approval.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.800]   If you do something and you make someone laugh or you make someone smile, that same response
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.280]   happens in your brain, that dopamine, "Do that more, more, more, more," right?
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.960]   I've got a son who's a class joker.
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:48.440]   He's a practical joker, and I can't explain to him how his brain works in those moments,
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.920]   but he knows when people laugh at me, his brain is telling him, "Do that more, more,
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.920]   more."
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.160]   And mom and dad are saying, "Stop, stop, stop," right?
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.600]   And teachers are saying, "Stop, stop, stop," because it's not right.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:04.760]   But the brain is telling him, "Do that more," because social approval is one of those tricks.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.160]   You do something and someone likes dopamine, boom, pop, do that again.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.520]   Your brain tells you to do it over and over again.
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.760]   And so that's part of the thing.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:21.120]   Just like sugar, you've got to separate yourself from that social approval that's going to
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.360]   spark that in your brain.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.320]   I think you have to get real with your own heart and what drives you to social media,
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.360]   then go to your sister and say, "Hey, here's what I've learned.
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.720]   Does this sound like something you struggle with?"
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:37.100]   That to me is the only approach that I know how to take, is just honesty with myself.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.880]   And that quite frankly is why I get so fed up with these Christian books and even non-Christian
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.840]   books that are like, "Your teenager is addicted to smartphones, here's how to fix them."
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.880]   No, no, no, no, no, because grandma's addicted to Facebook memes, right?
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:54.480]   I mean, let's be honest, like 60 plus year olds have some serious problems on Facebook,
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.480]   right?
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:01.420]   And so it's more about, "Okay, well, how is dad addicted to social media?"
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:07.120]   And then I go to my kids and say, "Here's what I feel in my own life going on and what
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.520]   drives me to do those things.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.520]   Can you relate?"
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.440]   So there's no shortcut to you getting honest with your own desires and then going to your
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.840]   sister and saying, "Hey, does this sound similar?"
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:17.840]   Is that helpful?
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.840]   Yes, thank you.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:19.840]   Thank you.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:20.840]   Thank you all for coming.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.840]   I appreciate the questions and your attention.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:31.400]   We could just thank Tony one more time for coming.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.240]   Really grateful for the students and leaders at Texas A&M, a pretty incredible school just
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.920]   by sheer size.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.920]   Very impressive.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.280]   What a trip.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:45.240]   Special thanks to the host of the event, Rachio Christy Temu, and the Veritas Forum for that
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.240]   event.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:51.440]   And thank you to Micah Green and to the moderator, Jared Oliphant, for leading so well that evening.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:57.200]   Of course, listening to a recording like this one is a special form of torture for me.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:02.360]   I kick myself for all the things that I left unsaid.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:06.960]   For students hearing all of this, and even non-students who are listening to this and
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:12.280]   who feel the weight of guilt from years of sinful patterns of smartphone abuse, I should
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:17.560]   have explicitly invited them to come to Christ for forgiveness and in Him to be freed from
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.560]   that weight.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.560]   I didn't.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.440]   I regret it, although I was able to do this in a few of the personal conversations that
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.720]   resulted after the meeting was adjourned.
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.480]   And to that student on YouTube who finds himself too easily distracted, I should have suggested
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.080]   that he also use audio-only podcasting apps.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.600]   Eliminating the visual element helps to tamp down distractions.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.960]   Alas, that's the end of retractions and additions.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.920]   The Pipers are back in the Twin Cities after a fruitful trip to South America.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.920]   Pastor John is scheduled to return to the studio next week, and I'll get you new episodes
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.600]   with him just as soon as I have them.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.480]   We'll see you soon.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.020]   [END]
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.020]   [END]
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.020]   [END]
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:02.020]   [END]
