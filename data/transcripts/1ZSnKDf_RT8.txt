[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   Dentists working today say, you know,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.520]   we're straightening your teeth,
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.520]   you should be happy about it, everything's fine.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.120]   A lot of the dentists I've been talking to for a long time,
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.760]   and I would say about 50%,
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.840]   have told me that all of these things that I had done,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.360]   extractions, braces, headgear, retainers,
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.320]   what they do, it's like foot binding,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.480]   like the ancient art of foot binding.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.880]   You take a kid's mouth that's too small for his face
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.600]   because his teeth are crooked, right?
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.120]   And you remove teeth,
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.440]   and then you crane the remaining teeth back
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.440]   and let the rest of the head grow, what's gonna happen?
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.160]   And so many dentists are saying,
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.640]   this is one of the primary reasons
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.480]   so many people are suffering from breathing problems,
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.720]   because their airways have been constricted,
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.500]   their jaws are set back like this.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.840]   They had one goal, straighten this kid's teeth at any cost,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.400]   at any cost to their mouth, their airway,
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.880]   the rest of their face, and that's what they did.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.200]   And this all came about in the 1940s,
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.680]   this production line dentistry,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.240]   It was never done this way.
