[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.860]   the Gospel according to St. Matthew, chapter 24, and I am going to read from verse 3 to
[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:20.860]   verse 14, from verse 3 to verse 14, in the 24th chapter of the Gospel according to St.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.860]   Matthew.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.380]   And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying,
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:36.340]   "Tell us, when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.380]   the end of the world?"
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.660]   And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Take heed that no man deceive you; for many shall
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.820]   come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many.
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.180]   And ye shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled; for all these
[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.180]   things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.620]   For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.260]   famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places.
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.140]   All these are the beginning of sorrows.
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.800]   Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.660]   And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.940]   And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.820]   And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.980]   And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.420]   But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.340]   And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.780]   And then shall the end come."
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.620]   We return to a consideration of the message of this twenty-fourth chapter of the gospel
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:16.660]   according to St. Matthew, judged by any standards whatsoever, a most important and a most vital
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.100]   message, and especially at this present time.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.500]   The world will all agree, whatever our views of Christianity or of anything else, we must
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.660]   all agree that the world is in a strange and extraordinary condition at this present time,
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:44.140]   a time of change, a time of flux, a time of confusion, a time of uncertainty.
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.460]   There is no question at all but that you and I are living through one of the great turning
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.440]   points in history.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:00.500]   We are living in one of those which I like to describe as climactic ages and epochs.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.700]   There are such periods to be seen in the history of the world, times when everything as it
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.140]   were is thrown into the melting pot, and the old order which had persisted for so long
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.500]   seems to come to an end, and men and women are bewildered and are wondering as to what
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.980]   is going to happen.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.100]   Now it is very difficult for us to realize this, isn't it?
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.180]   We all are so immersed by the details of our lives and work and occupation that it is very
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.860]   difficult for us to stand back, as it were, and look upon the course of history as a whole
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.980]   and as a larger unit.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.960]   We are so involved, I say, in the details, the small things of life, that it is so easy
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.300]   for us not to realize that this tremendous thing is happening round and about us and
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.860]   is happening to us.
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.900]   And as I began to say last Sunday evening, the question people are asking is, "What
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.340]   is the meaning of all this?"
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.740]   It is rather baffling, it is surprising.
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.900]   Nobody anticipated that this was the sort of thing that was going to happen in this
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.340]   twentieth century.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.420]   And people looking at the walls and at the preparation for yet more terrible walls are
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.940]   rightly asking the question, "What is the cause of all this?
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.060]   What is to be the outcome?
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.060]   What is the end?
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.600]   Is there any security to be found anywhere in life?
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.940]   Is there any word that can give us some understanding, some explanation, and some hope?"
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.940]   These are inevitably the questions that people are asking.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.820]   And it is because of all that that I am directing your attention to this great chapter.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:53.420]   For here, the Lord Jesus Christ himself deals with this very situation, with this exact
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.940]   problem.
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.420]   And therefore, it is for us to listen to him.
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.900]   I gave some reasons last Sunday evening why we should do so.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.580]   It is because he is the speaker.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.240]   Here, you see in this chapter, he does two things.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.340]   He makes an immediate prophecy as to what is going to happen to the city of Jerusalem
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.340]   and to the temple in particular.
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.340]   You remember, don't you?
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.660]   Jesus went out from the temple and departed, and his disciples came to him for to show
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.940]   him the buildings of the temple.
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.260]   And Jesus said unto them, "See ye not all these things?
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.380]   Verily I say unto you, there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.180]   not be thrown down."
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.220]   In other words, in the chapter, he does predict and prophesy the destruction of that temple
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.780]   that was there then and of the whole city of Jerusalem.
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.940]   But in addition to that, he goes on and deals with the whole course of history and the end
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.060]   of the world.
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.180]   The disciples asked him that question.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.640]   Tell us, they said, when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.060]   and of the end of the world?
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.140]   Now he deals with that in this chapter.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.140]   The two things are dealt with at one and the same time.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.260]   And I say that the reason for listening to him is this.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.780]   If we had no other reason, this would be enough.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.700]   There he was speaking, let us say roughly A.D. 32 or 33, and talking about the destruction
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.260]   of the temple and of Jerusalem.
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.260]   And in A.D. 70, it literally actually happened.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.620]   Now that is history, that is fact.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.900]   That is not my theory, it is not anybody else's theory.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.420]   This is sheer fact.
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:54.820]   He prophesied it so many years before it happened, and then it did happen, literally.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:02.020]   Not one stone was left upon another of that mighty, magnificent pile of buildings known
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.700]   as the temple.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:10.180]   I say if you have no other reason to listen to him, pay due heed and attention to that.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.220]   One who is capable of this should surely be listened to.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.100]   It seemed so unreasonable then, so impossible, but it happened.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.780]   Very well, if he is right there, why not here?
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.460]   Listen to him about the end of the world.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:30.080]   And then we have seen that he tells us various things in general principles.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:36.220]   He warns us that the things which we think are durable and unshakable are going to be
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.000]   destroyed.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.780]   The kingdoms of this world and all their pomp and power are going to pass away.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:52.240]   The things on which men think they can bank their everything will vanish and disappear.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.460]   But he tells us also why that is happening, why that is going to happen.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:02.420]   And there is only one reason for it, it is because of men's rebellion against God.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.980]   It is because of men's defiance of God.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:11.660]   It is because men's sin calls down the wrath of God.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.760]   And that is what he prophesies.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:21.220]   But at the same time, and thank God for this, he shows us the way to escape.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:29.800]   If we repent and believe in him, we need never be involved in this terrible, horrible destruction
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:37.300]   that is going to come upon the world outside God, and all the eternal consequences that
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.540]   will follow from that.
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.540]   That is his message.
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:44.520]   It is a surprising message; it is a startling message.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.520]   But that is the message.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.780]   And I say that the business of preaching is to call men and women to listen to it and
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.780]   to pay attention to it.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:59.120]   But now I know very well that there are large numbers of people in the world tonight who
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.980]   not only don't listen to it, but won't listen to it.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:10.060]   They quite openly say so, and they give their reason for not listening to it.
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.760]   "Ah," they say, "there you are, the Christian church and you Christian preachers still go
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.660]   on preaching that same old gospel."
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.340]   But they say, "You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.820]   Why do you go on preaching a message like that?
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.540]   That is such an obvious failure."
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.140]   Now, you are familiar with this argument, I am sure.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.060]   This is how they put it commonly.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:37.780]   Now they say, "Here is this gospel of yours, for which you are claiming so much, and which
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.060]   you say was preached by one whom you say was the Son of God."
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.060]   Now then, they say, "Here are the facts.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:53.900]   This gospel of yours has been preached now in this world for nearly 2,000 long years.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.540]   There have been times in the history of the world, in that interval of time, when the
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.460]   church has been in a dominating position.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.180]   She had power over men and women, she could coerce them and make them listen."
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.180]   Very well.
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.260]   Here is your gospel, it's been preached for 2,000 years and people have been listening
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.580]   to it and accepting your doctrines and your dogmas.
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.100]   But they say, "Look at the state of the world.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.260]   Look at it with its wars.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.200]   Look at it with its confusion.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.380]   Look at it with the nations behaving as they are behaving at the present time and piling
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.660]   up these horrible armaments and bombs."
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.780]   They say the thing is insulting.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:39.580]   Your gospel, they say, of all things, is utterly condemned as a failure.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:45.660]   It's had a marvelous opportunity for nearly 2,000 years and it's achieved nothing.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:51.980]   The state of the world is the absolute proof, they say, that your gospel is all nonsense.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.660]   And they refuse even to listen to it.
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.060]   They're going to turn somewhere else.
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.500]   They're going to turn to politics or they're going to turn to anything that can give us
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.620]   some hope of putting an end to our troubles and banishing war and bringing in a time of
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.700]   peace and of plenty and prosperity and happiness for all.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:17.260]   The gospel, they say, has had this marvelous opportunity to improve and to reform the world
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.780]   and make it a better place.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:26.140]   And it has disastrously and completely failed to do so.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:33.100]   Now I'm sure that we're all familiar with that case and with that particular argument.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:40.740]   You see, it's based upon this idea that the primary function and purpose of this New Testament
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:49.220]   gospel is to improve and is to reform the world.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:54.660]   That that is its claim, that the Lord Jesus Christ preached it with that intent and sent
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.700]   out his disciples and apostles to do the same thing.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:04.420]   That the gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel, a doctrine, a message, therefore, of social
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:10.540]   improvement, social amelioration, righting wrongs, mitigating sufferings, getting rid
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:16.940]   of that which is harmful, building up a new society, introducing the kingdom of God, making
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.460]   the world a perfect place in which to live.
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:25.260]   Now that's their theory, that that is what the gospel claims to do, that that is what
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.220]   the gospel from the very beginning has promised to do, has offered to do.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.060]   That that is the real message of Christianity.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.980]   And therefore, and it seems quite logical, doesn't it, they say that the world's condition
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:47.260]   tonight is the thing that completely deflates the gospel and shows how completely useless
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.580]   and idle and valueless it is.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:56.580]   It has failed to do so the argument runs the very things that it promised to do.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:04.300]   Well, now then, I want to show you this evening how our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ dealt
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:11.140]   with that very case, that very argument, nearly two thousand years ago.
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:18.260]   The complete answer to all that is here in this passage that we are looking at at this
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.740]   very moment.
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:24.860]   Now I'm urgent about this, and I'm urgent about it for this reason.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:31.660]   I cannot imagine anything more tragic than that any man or woman should go to his or
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:39.660]   her grave and go out into eternity, outside God and the blessings of the Christian salvation,
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:48.860]   simply because of this profound and tragic misunderstanding with respect to the very
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.900]   primary object of the gospel.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.580]   But there are many such.
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.140]   You are all, as I say, certainly familiar with such people.
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.500]   They think it's beyond argument.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.300]   Look at the world, they say.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.460]   Your gospel has been tried.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.780]   It has been found wanting.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.300]   It cannot do it.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:12.020]   It has failed to make the world the kind of place that we would like to see it as.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:18.540]   Well now then, let us listen to what our Lord has got to say about this very position.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.700]   I'll put it to you in the number of propositions.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.620]   Here's the first.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:36.980]   The gospel has never said, has never claimed, has never set out to reform or to improve
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.060]   the world.
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.240]   Is the proposition clear?
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:52.900]   The gospel of Jesus Christ, I say, has never said that it was going to reform or to improve
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.780]   the world.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.900]   Now that's a strong statement, isn't it?
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.780]   But I'll throw it out as a challenge.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:10.380]   Can anybody present produce me any evidence to show that anywhere in the gospel there
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.260]   is such a promise?
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.060]   And the answer is, of course, that there isn't such a promise.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:22.540]   Well, where has this idea come from, that the business of the gospel is to improve the
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.540]   world?
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.340]   Where's it come from?
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.260]   And the answer is, wherever it's come from, it most certainly has not come from the New
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.780]   Testament, because it just isn't here.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.460]   Oh, but I can tell you where it's come from.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.780]   And this is what makes this particular misunderstanding of the gospel that we're looking at tonight
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.620]   so pathetic.
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.900]   I'll tell you where it's come from.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:56.380]   It's come from the philosophers, it's come from the scientists, it's come from the very
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:01.660]   people to whom people are turning at the present time as they turn away from the gospel and
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.660]   from the Church.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:07.620]   "Oh," they say, "that old gospel, that's finished, outmoded, proved to be wrong, useless.
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.260]   Now then, we'll listen to the philosophers, we'll listen to the scientists, here are men
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.780]   at any rate who are practical and are looking at facts as they are instead of dreaming dreams
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.940]   and promise making lavish promises which never come to pass.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.820]   Practical scientific attitude towards life is what we want."
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:29.140]   Well now then, the fact is, of course, that this whole idea of the world being reformed
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:35.180]   and improving and being better each generation than it was in the previous one has come from
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:45.180]   such gentlemen, your philosophers and scientists, and your politicians and various other people.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.460]   They have certainly made that promise.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.060]   It's a part of their case.
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:17:00.300]   You can't accept the theory, the hypothesis about evolution without believing that the
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.060]   world ought to be getting better and better.
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:07.860]   It's essentially the thing that is taught by evolution.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.540]   That's not the Bible, that's philosophic science.
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:16.740]   Not the Bible at all, but very definitely philosophy and science mixed up and jumbled
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.160]   up together, and theories turned into facts, and then the whole thing put forward.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.660]   That teaches that.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:29.060]   In other words, that outlook is something which tells us this, that all the world really
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:33.980]   needs is to be educated.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.980]   It needs to be trained.
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:43.380]   You see a wild colt in the field, full of energy and power, but he's rough and raw.
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.820]   Well, he's no use like that.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:48.380]   Well, you must catch him this end, you must train him, you must put him into a stable,
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.460]   and then you gradually train him.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.340]   You must lead him first, then you put a saddle on his back, and then you gingerly get onto
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.340]   that saddle.
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.500]   So, you gradually train him to carry you, and then he's afraid of motor cars.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.260]   Well, you familiarize him, you educate him, and eventually you'll have a wonderful horse
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.940]   whom you can ride, or put in a trap, or anything that you may be anxious to do for your own
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.940]   pleasure.
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:08.940]   Education.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.460]   Now, they say the whole of mankind is like that, the world is like that.
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:18.780]   The world is very much in the raw, it's got a good deal of the animal and the beast in
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.780]   it still.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.220]   Well, now, what is needed?
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.580]   What is needed in order to put the world right?
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:31.140]   Well, obviously, education, training.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.140]   If you see two boys fighting, you say, "Now, don't be foolish.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.980]   One of you is going to get hurt, perhaps both of you.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:37.980]   Don't be silly."
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:42.380]   If you see two grown-up men fighting, you say, "What are you doing?"
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.780]   If you see them getting drunk, and their wives and children starving, you go and point out
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.620]   and look at the consequences of your action.
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.660]   It's wrong, it's a foolish thing to do, you mustn't do that.
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:57.540]   And so, you work it up until you come to nations, and you say to nations, "Well, now, look here.
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.140]   Let's take a survey of history.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.500]   Do you see the effects of wars always?
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.780]   They always lead to pestilences and to great suffering.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:11.820]   There's always a terrible time in the wake of any kind of war, even the victors themselves
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.820]   suffer."
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.580]   And then you say to them, "Well, now, there's the evidence.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.260]   Well, what about it?
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:22.180]   Let's meet round the table, and let's agree together not to be foolish."
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.340]   You see, what's needed is thought.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.180]   People's minds need to be trained.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.460]   Man instinctively hits the other man before he reasons.
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.180]   "Well," you say, "you don't do that.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.700]   You don't start by hitting.
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.500]   You start by having a quiet, friendly discussion.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:40.100]   You talk about these things, and point out how unreasonable it is.
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:45.180]   That's education as applied to the whole situation of mankind."
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:51.900]   So the argument has been that by means of education and reform, and the removal, I say,
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:57.180]   of wrongs and hindrances, and the giving of better conditions, and the gradual uplifting
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:05.580]   of the whole of society, we can get rid of our problems and of our difficulties.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:11.540]   And so, the more of this kind of thing that we get, the more of this education, the better
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.140]   will the world become.
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:18.860]   And obviously, it'll go on getting better and better as this education seeps into the
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.460]   minds of men and women.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:25.700]   Now, they say, "You've got to be, of course, exact and scientific in your proposals.
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.780]   You can't suddenly put it and people will jump at it at once."
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:29.780]   No, no.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.580]   These things take a long time.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.580]   Mankind is rather stupid.
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.500]   It's slow of hearing.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:41.580]   But if you go on ramming it in, go on repeating it, they'll gradually get to understand it.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.700]   So you must be patient and give it a little time.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:49.180]   But as the years pass, and the decades pass especially, then you will find that there
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.260]   will be a constant rise in the level, and eventually you'll have the perfect society
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.220]   and the perfect world.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.700]   War will be banished once and forever.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.780]   Men will turn their swords into plowshares.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.260]   They'll even get rid of their local national parliaments.
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.380]   You'll have the Parliament of Men, the Federation of the World.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.380]   That's it, isn't it?
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:20.180]   Yes, but you see, I haven't been preaching the gospel for the last five minutes or so.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:24.420]   I've been putting the politicians and the philosophers and your Tennyson's and your
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:28.660]   Victorian poets into my own language.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.580]   It is they who've taught this.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.580]   It is not the gospel.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.180]   Oh, but I want to be fair.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:40.500]   The times in which we are living are so urgent and so desperate that even at the risk of
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:45.740]   being misunderstood, I want to put something very plainly before you.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:54.260]   The fault lies not only with the politicians and the philosophers and the poets.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:22:02.700]   Alas, there are many preachers who've got to be put into the same category.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:07.500]   You see, towards the end of the last century, there were many men preaching in Christian
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.980]   pulpits, who preached this very philosophy of improvement.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.060]   And of course, they became tremendously interested in politics.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:21.260]   You had your so-called preacher politicians, and I blame them more than anybody for the
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.900]   state of the church and the state of the world today.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:32.020]   They mixed up this atheistical evolutionary theory with the gospel of Jesus Christ, and
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.500]   they introduced that element in it, and they taught the people that the gospel was just
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:41.940]   a form of teaching which was meant to reform society and to improve the condition of the
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.560]   whole world.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.940]   And it is because so many of them did that, that so many people tonight, as I am trying
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.660]   to say, won't even listen to the gospel.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:58.380]   They've always held that view, that that is what the gospel promised, that is what
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.860]   it set out to do.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:06.020]   This is the supreme teaching, therefore this, of all teachings, is the one that's going
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:10.500]   to banish the problems and introduce a kind of millennium.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.700]   But they say it hasn't come, and therefore they're no longer interested in the gospel.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:22.500]   Well, I say the first answer to that tragic misunderstanding of the gospel is that it
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:28.100]   is nothing but a gross misunderstanding of the gospel.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:34.460]   That the gospel itself has never said that, and that that is to import into the gospel
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:44.700]   and to impose upon it a theory which belongs altogether to another and to an alien realm.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:50.760]   Well, that's my first proposition, but I don't stop there.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.900]   Not only then is it true to say in the first place that the gospel of Jesus Christ has
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:04.500]   never promised that, in the second place, I put it to you that the gospel specifically,
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:13.420]   and not merely implicitly, but explicitly, says the exact opposite.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:18.700]   Now then, that's the peculiar message of these verses that we're looking at tonight.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:23.740]   I beg of you, go home and read this twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew's gospel.
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.780]   Read the whole of it.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.500]   Read the same thing in the twenty-first chapter of Luke's gospel.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.620]   Read the same thing in the thirteenth chapter of Mark's gospel.
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.780]   Read the same thing in the second epistle of Peter, chapter three.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:42.020]   Read the book of Revelations; it's everywhere.
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.420]   What is the message then?
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:50.220]   Well, I say it is the exact opposite of what men and women think it is.
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.620]   Does the gospel promise to make the world better and better?
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.100]   No.
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:05.580]   It tells us that the world more or less remains a constant, and that indeed at times it even
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.060]   gets worse and worse.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.060]   Listen to our Lord.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:18.140]   "There are these disciples saying to him, 'Master,' they said, 'tell us, when shall
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:25.780]   these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world,
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.180]   the end of the age?'
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.420]   And he proceeds to answer them.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.340]   And what does he foretell?
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:42.340]   Does he foretell a period of increasing prosperity and understanding and truth and men and women
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:47.740]   being delivered from all that had made life so miserable before he came, and a wonderful
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.260]   world which is like a paradise?'"
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.340]   Well, I have read the answer to you, haven't I?
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:58.380]   He prophesies and predicts the exact opposite.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.820]   He prophesies trouble, though his gospel is going to be preached.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.300]   He says there will be trouble.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:11.320]   He says there will be wars and rumors of wars.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.860]   But I thought the business of the gospel, says somebody, was to do away with war.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:21.100]   No, says Christ, though my gospel is going to be preached, there will be wars and rumors
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.260]   of wars, and still more preparation for wars.
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:31.420]   He's prophesied it—pestilences, earthquakes.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:40.800]   "Yes, and in the midst of all these things, the element of deceitfulness.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.980]   Be not deceived," he says.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:49.820]   "Our Lord, looking to the future, says, 'You know, men will be deceiving one another.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.740]   There will be false hopes.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.860]   People will arise who will say, 'Listen to me.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.060]   I am the Christ.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.060]   I am the one who has got salvation.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.060]   Follow me.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.180]   Adopt my theory.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.100]   Listen to me.'
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.700]   And many will run after them.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:08.700]   They'll listen to these false prophets, these deceivers."
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:16.420]   Oh, his view of history, looking forward as he did then nearly 2,000 years ago, is, "Were
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.220]   the world in trouble?"
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:23.620]   "Oh, but," says somebody, "I wish if I'd known that you were going to preach this sort
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.060]   of thing, I wouldn't have come at all.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.660]   I came for a little bit of hope.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.780]   My dear friend, what you need is truth.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.580]   And you only get it in this gospel.
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:45.660]   Our Lord has told us that the world is going to be exactly as we know it tonight—trouble,
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:56.780]   trials, tribulations, wars, rumors of wars, deceit amongst men, false hopes, false theories,
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:01.260]   and people rushing after them and clutching at them, believing them, only to be shown
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:08.380]   later that they've been fools and dupes, and that they lack discrimination and understanding,
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:13.620]   that they were governed by their desires rather than by their knowledge and by an understanding
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.620]   of truth.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:23.020]   And in addition to all this," he says, "a hatred of Christianity, a hatred of him, a
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:27.940]   hatred of his followers, a hatred of his preachers, a hatred of his people.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.660]   'They'll kill you,' he says.
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:30.780]   'Why, what have they done?
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.180]   They've done nothing at all.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.140]   They're simply preachers of the gospel.
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:38.220]   They're offering men and women eternal and everlasting salvation, but the world hates
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.220]   them.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.260]   And it's killed many of them, and so it has, hasn't it?
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.340]   And it's still doing so this evening."
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.820]   Now that is the kind of picture that our Lord puts, and the graphic way in which he does
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.300]   it is most astounding.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.540]   It's almost a perfect description, isn't it, of the modern world.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:00.900]   He said, "Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, see that ye be not troubled."
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.460]   But there are some foolish people who are troubled.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.700]   They feel that because there are wars and rumours of wars that Christianity is failing.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.780]   No, no, it's not failing.
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:14.220]   It's never said it's going to put an end to wars and put an end to rumours of wars.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:20.980]   He says, "See that ye be not troubled, for all these things must come to pass, but the
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.420]   end is not yet.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.940]   For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:32.540]   famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places."
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:42.420]   All these, he says, are the beginning of sorrows.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.940]   Worse things are to come.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.940]   This is the gospel.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:51.100]   Not that the world is going to get better and better, but that as the end of the age
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:58.540]   approaches, it's going to get worse.
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:04.340]   All this that has been true of mankind and its long history is going to be accentuated.
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:08.380]   It's going to become more violent, more devilish, more hellish.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:14.900]   These are but the beginning of sorrows.
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.660]   That is his teaching.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.460]   That is his prophecy.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.820]   That is what he, who is the author of the gospel, says is going to be the course of
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:32.060]   history in the world in which his gospel is going to be preached.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:38.460]   Far from improving, reforming, making the world better and better and better, until
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.220]   when you come to the twentieth century, there will be no problems left at all.
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.080]   That is what he predicts.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.300]   That is what he says is going to be the condition.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.060]   Now, my dear friend, can't you see the obvious implication?
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.660]   Aren't you already drawing the inevitable deduction?
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:59.540]   It is this.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:06.500]   It is the gospel of Jesus Christ alone that throughout the centuries has made this prediction
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.140]   and prophecy about the state of the world.
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.260]   Nothing else has done so.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:17.380]   The optimism with respect to the future has always been in men who have not believed the
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.380]   gospel.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.820]   You can read their books, their utopias, their planning and all that.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.780]   They have always been present in every generation.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:28.220]   It is men who have been optimistic about the future of society and of the world.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:35.980]   The gospel never has, and therefore, don't you see, you should draw this deduction.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:45.380]   The state of the world this evening, far from proving that the gospel isn't true or that
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:53.700]   the gospel has failed, the state of the world tonight proves the truth of the gospel in
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.180]   a way that nothing else does.
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:02.740]   Here has been this testimony now for nearly two thousand years, pitting itself against
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.900]   these optimists, these politicians, and all the rest of them, who are always telling us
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.380]   about a wonderful future that is about to come.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.420]   "No," says the gospel, "it is not going to come.
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.780]   It never will come.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:20.660]   The world will go on like this, and at the end it will be even worse."
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:29.900]   My dear friend, can't you see that the state of the world at this moment, far from disproving
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:35.340]   the gospel, is an absolute proof of the truth of the gospel?
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:41.100]   What the gospel said would be, actually is.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:46.660]   I know of nothing that is such a proof of the divine inspiration of this book as the
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:56.420]   way in which the modern world at this very minute is proving the truth of its case.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:05.460]   The argument of this modern man, who won't listen to the gospel, is completely false.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:10.980]   He has got it precisely the wrong way round.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:17.420]   The world as it is proves the gospel to be God's Word.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.340]   It is true.
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:27.260]   The world is verifying the prediction and the prophecy of the Son of God.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.060]   But you see, it doesn't stop even there.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:35.820]   I go on now to my third proposition, which is this.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:41.260]   The gospel doesn't stop at a mere bare statement that this is going to be the state of the
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:45.860]   world and that this is the future.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:56.860]   It supplies us with the explanation as to why this is the case, and always will be.
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:00.740]   Now, this is to me something most profound.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:09.580]   I am almost tempted to put it like this, that perhaps there is no better test as to whether
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.300]   you are a Christian or not than simply this.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:20.660]   Are you dumbfounded because of what is happening in the world?
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:24.520]   Are you surprised that the world is as it is tonight?
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.340]   Is it to you a matter of astonishment and amazement?
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.740]   Do you feel that your whole position is shaking?
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:34.260]   Are you beginning to say, "Well, now, my theories all seem to have been wrong"?
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.260]   Are you astounded?
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:41.700]   Well, you know, if you are, well, to say the least, you are a very poor and a very badly
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:45.820]   instructed Christian.
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.860]   For the gospel not only tells us that it is going to be like this, it tells us exactly
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:55.060]   why it is going to be like this, and it is all in these verses that we are looking at
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.060]   this evening.
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.380]   Here is the explanation.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.740]   Why is the world like this?
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:09.300]   Well, the world is like this because of the heart of men, because of the evil that is
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:21.460]   in the heart of men, this deceit that he talks about, this lust which he mentions, all the
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.700]   greed which he indicates in what he says here.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:31.860]   Now, our Lord says that that is the cause of the trouble, that there is evil in the
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.700]   very heart of men.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:39.140]   James, you remember, puts it in respect to the one particular matter of war in this way.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.380]   He says, "Whence come wars among you?"
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:45.660]   Read the fourth chapter of James' epistle, "Whence come wars among you?"
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.100]   He answers the question.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:54.980]   He says, "They come even of your lusts that are within you."
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:36:00.940]   Ye desire and ye have not, and because you are all doing the same, you fight one another.
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:06.860]   It is lust, the cause of war is lust in the human heart, and there is no other explanation
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.860]   of it.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:15.540]   In other words, our Lord's way of putting it is this, that the world is as it is because
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:25.620]   of its final hatred of God, because of its hatred of God's laws.
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:30.940]   The world is as it is because men rebelled against God and refused to continue living
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.740]   according to God's most holy laws.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:37.380]   You see, as long as he did that, his world was paradise.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:41.060]   He did not have to earn his living by the sweat of his brow, he simply picked the fruit
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.060]   of the garden.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:45.700]   But old man was not content with that, he wanted to be as a God.
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.580]   He believed he could manage his own world in a better way than God could do, so he rebelled
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.580]   against God.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:54.080]   He ate of the forbidden fruit, and he brought chaos upon himself, and he has been in it
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.500]   ever since, and he will be to the end.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.500]   Why?
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:05.340]   Because he is trying to run his world, and because of this rebellion his nature has fallen,
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:11.980]   and he is controlled by lust and desire, rather than by truth and justice and righteousness
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:17.100]   and the will and the way of a holy God.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.220]   Did you notice how our Lord puts it?
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:25.860]   He says, "They not only hate me, and they not only will hate you and kill you and put
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:30.100]   to death," he says, "they will even hate one another."
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.300]   Now that is a surprising thing, isn't it?
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.700]   You would have thought that at any rate they would have had the sense to all combine together
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.700]   against God.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:41.140]   If God is the enemy, well, let us all combine, let us have a mammoth trade union against
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.060]   God, and then all will be well.
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:47.100]   But they do not do that, they hate one another, they are fighting within the trade union.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.100]   Why?
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:54.420]   Oh, you see, for this reason, the moment man does not bow before God, he becomes a God
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.420]   himself.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:59.660]   Yes, but the other man is a God also, and it is a fight between the gods.
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.420]   I want to have everything, but the other man wants to have everything.
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.820]   Well, there is nothing to do but to fight for it.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:11.620]   That is the cause of the state of the world, my dear friend.
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:19.740]   That is the cause of the whole unhappiness of men and women this evening.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:28.620]   Why, I ask again, is there all this infidelity and all this separation, all this divorce,
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:35.460]   the tearing of families, the neglect of little children, the wounding of their little minds,
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:44.460]   and all the consequences that follow, and all the unhappiness, whence comes it?
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:51.740]   Even amongst educated people, amongst philosophers, amongst scientists, whence comes it?
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:56.060]   There is only one answer.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:01.540]   It comes from the lust that is within them.
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:08.060]   The problem, you see, is deeper than education, it is deeper than the level of a man's mind.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:15.180]   There are in every one of us, by nature, that comes into this world these lusts, these passions,
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:20.620]   these drives, these forces that are stronger than our minds and that make me do something
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.060]   that I know to be wrong.
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.460]   I know I will regret it afterwards, I still do it.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.740]   I want it.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.740]   It moves me.
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.740]   It grips me.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.500]   I am a helpless victim in its hands.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.700]   That is why the world is as it is.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:43.240]   It is evil, it is lust, in the heart, down in the very depths of man's personality.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:47.900]   You can pass all the Acts of Parliament that the imagination and the ingenuity of men can
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:53.820]   ever think of or conceive of, and they will not touch your lust.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.780]   Would to God you could get rid of lust by Acts of Parliament, would not we all thank
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:58.780]   God for it?
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:03.660]   If by Acts of Parliament you could get rid of your temper, would not you be pleased?
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:06.740]   But you know that an Act of Parliament leaves you exactly where you were.
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:13.580]   And so with all the lusts and all the things that make life a shambles, you cannot reform
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:17.180]   these things out of existence.
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:21.860]   You cannot legislate these things and cause them to disappear.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:29.220]   No, no, moral suasion, poetry, beauty, art, music, bring them all to play.
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.820]   They will have a temporary effect, but they will not get rid of your lust.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:33.820]   It remains.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.540]   It is the profoundest thing in man in his fallen state.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:43.180]   That is why the world is as it is.
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.260]   And it can listen to all your appeals and all your knowledge.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:50.580]   It knows it all, but it is not governed by it.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:57.180]   And another aspect of this matter that I would like to emphasize is this.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:06.780]   Every man, every person that is born into this world is born like that.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:11.980]   Every one of us, every one of us was born like that.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:16.620]   Every one of our children has been born like that and will be born like that.
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:20.140]   You know, this is a remarkable thing, and people with all their knowledge do not seem
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.980]   to be able to see it.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:29.900]   There is no such thing as the inheritance of acquired characteristics.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:34.280]   And the whole of this false notion which we are considering is based upon that.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.980]   You see, it works like this.
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:44.940]   Educate this present generation with your gospel, and then, of course, the next generation
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:49.860]   that follows this must start where we left off.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.420]   Then you will give them a bit more, and they will be higher.
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:56.740]   Then the next one will start with the inheritance of acquired characteristics.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.740]   That is the basis of this other theory.
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.980]   So that when we are born into this world, we are born, as it were, on the shoulders
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.660]   of our fathers and mothers.
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:12.380]   We start not where they started, we start on their shoulders, and on and on it goes.
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:17.540]   The inheritance of acquired characteristics.
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:21.620]   But there has never been such rubbish, such nonsense.
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:26.460]   Alas, unfortunately, that is not true.
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:32.080]   But we are all born into this world sinners, exactly as our parents were.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.340]   We are no better than our parents, not at all.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.580]   Do not you often see this in history?
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.660]   It is very striking you see it in the Bible.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:49.140]   You will have a most saintly king in the Old Testament, a marvellous man, a friend of God.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:55.140]   Then you begin to read the history of his son, who was a blaggard, a scamp, a fool,
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:59.140]   who turned away from his father's way and rebelled against God.
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:04.300]   No, no, you do not inherit these acquired characteristics.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.220]   And though you may teach one generation, it tells you nothing about the next.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.660]   The history even of the Church is these alternations of up and down and good and bad.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:17.580]   No, no, every one of us is born in sin and shapen in iniquity.
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:22.740]   The Gospel of Jesus Christ, far from saying that it is a social and moral improvement
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.900]   program, says this.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:31.500]   You, every one of you, whenever you live, whenever you are born, you must be born again.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.340]   Why?
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:38.540]   Well because by your first birth you are born in sin, you are born a creature of lust
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.220]   and of passion.
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.220]   Every generation needs the Gospel.
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.740]   You cannot rest on your oars.
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:48.180]   The Gospel is needed in every generation as much as in every other generation.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.000]   You do not go on and build on what has happened.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.360]   We all start at the bottom.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:58.780]   We all must be born again.
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:02.900]   Isn't it amazing that anybody can conceivably misunderstand this?
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:08.820]   Here is the Gospel, the very center of which is this message about the rebirth and about
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:16.980]   regeneration and about being created anew for all generations, and yet they think that
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:24.340]   it is a program for moral and social and political amelioration and improvement.
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:30.140]   My dear friend, the Gospel is the exact opposite of that.
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:35.780]   This is the message which tells us that the world is as it is because of man's evil heart
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:41.460]   and that nothing will suffice for him but a new heart, to be born again, to be given
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:46.860]   the gift of life by God, after God has forgiven him for his sin.
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.700]   That is the message.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:54.140]   The Son of God did not come into the world to improve the world.
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:45:02.100]   He said himself, "The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.780]   He came and he died on Calvary.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.780]   What for?
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:12.340]   To rescue us and redeem us out of this present evil world before it is hurtled to the final
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:15.700]   disaster, to the ultimate destruction.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:23.260]   Therefore, for me to close this evening, we must go on with this chapter.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:28.740]   But to close this evening, I say, therefore, to you, my friend, that the problem for you
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:33.140]   is not the problem of the state of the world.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:40.100]   It is the problem of the state of your own heart.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:46.420]   You forget the world for a moment because the world, you know, is nothing but you multiplied
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:47.420]   by millions.
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.200]   That is what the world is.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   What fools we are.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.380]   We say, "Isn't the world awful?"
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:53.380]   What is the world?
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:59.780]   It is you, it is me, multiplied by millions.
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:04.340]   So the question for us is not to be looking at the state of the world and making our big
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.620]   statements.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:10.380]   Let us examine ourselves and let me ask a few questions.
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:15.460]   What is your attitude towards God?
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:19.700]   It is, I say, the false attitude towards God on behalf of the whole world, on the part
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:23.140]   of the whole world that makes the world what it is.
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:27.740]   Very well, what is your attitude towards God?
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:34.740]   Are you living a life like Adam did in paradise before he fell, waiting for God's will, rejoicing
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.700]   to do it, glorying in it?
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:42.540]   Is that your life?
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.740]   What is your view of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:50.260]   Why did he come into this world?
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:55.340]   Why did he die on that cross on Calvary's hill?
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:47:02.980]   Have you realized that he did that and had to do it because you and I were so guilty
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:11.700]   before God in his holiness that nothing but that could save us, that he took our punishment
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:19.840]   upon himself, stood in our place, was made a curse for us, that we might be forgiven
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.620]   and redeemed?
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:31.300]   Do you realize that he came to give you a new heart, a new nature, a new life, a new
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:35.740]   beginning because nothing else would suffice you?
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:41.940]   Do you realize that he did all this because we simply cannot be improved?
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.340]   Of course.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:49.060]   We can change our clothing, but that isn't to improve a man.
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:52.100]   To give a man a new suit doesn't make him a new man.
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.900]   To put him in a palace rather than a pigsty doesn't make him a new man.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:59.660]   It's the heart of men that matters.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:05.880]   It is out of the heart that come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, and all
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:09.620]   the things that make life what it is this evening.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:20.260]   Man needs, and nothing will suffice him but, a new heart, a clean heart, a new nature,
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:25.740]   the nature of God, and he came in order to give us that.
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.980]   Do you believe that?
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.220]   Have you seen that truth concerning him?
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:34.020]   Have you seen that that's his message, that's his reason for coming?
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:46.660]   Listen, I pray you, I beseech you, as I value your immortal soul and as I tremble to think
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.820]   of your eternal destiny, if you don't listen to him.
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:57.060]   Listen to this one, this son of God, this accurate prophet, this one who sees the whole
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:07.820]   of history and is the Lord of history, listen to him as he calls to you this evening.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:16.740]   In this modern, troubled, anxious, bewildered world, listen to him as he says to you, "Come
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:32.860]   to me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest, peace, perfect peace,
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:43.780]   in this dark world of sin, the blood of Jesus whispers peace within."
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.100]   Yet the world doesn't trust that.
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.460]   The future of the world is plain.
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.460]   What of you?
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.260]   Are you to be involved in its final destruction?
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.260]   You needn't be.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:56.260]   Listen to him.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:04.780]   He calls you to repent, to acknowledge your sin, your folly, your unbelief.
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:16.180]   Cast yourself upon him and his love, repent, he says, and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:21.340]   And you will not only be saved from that coming destruction, you will have this new nature,
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.420]   this new life.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:27.060]   You will have an understanding of the world as it is and as it is going to be.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:35.380]   And you'll no longer be afraid because you will know that you belong to the kingdom of
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:44.860]   God, the kingdom of Christ, and that you'll be in it through all eternity.
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.820]   Listen to him.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.460]   Amen.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:53.380]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
