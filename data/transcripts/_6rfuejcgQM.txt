[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   - Last time, Gene had written in to ask,
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.640]   "Pastor John, how do I handle the envy and jealousy
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.480]   "that are eating away at me?"
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.800]   And in the last podcast, in episode 151,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.180]   you addressed the envy side,
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.880]   and you wanted to address them individually.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.320]   So now, Pastor John, address the jealousy category.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.920]   - Right, I wanted to break jealousy and envy up
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.000]   because jealousy, I think, is significantly different.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.920]   Jealousy is an anger
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.160]   because someone else is getting affections
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.420]   that I believe belong to me.
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.240]   And that's not always wrong, right?
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.480]   It's not wrong to be angry
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.960]   at a wife or a husband
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.440]   who are giving their marital affections to another
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.040]   when they're married to you.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.200]   We know it's not wrong
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.200]   because God is called a jealous God in Exodus 20.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.760]   You shall have no other gods before me.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.120]   You shall not bow down to them or serve them
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.240]   for I, the Lord, your God, am a jealous God.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.480]   In other words, your allegiance, your love,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.520]   your worship belongs to me.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.240]   Don't give it to anybody else.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.760]   If you give it to somebody else,
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.480]   I get angry because I'm a jealous God.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.320]   I want all of your love, all of your worship,
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.920]   your allegiance, your affections for me.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.520]   And that's a beautiful thing of God to do
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.080]   because he is infinitely worthy
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.840]   of those allegiance and affections,
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.100]   and therefore it is a loving thing of God
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.480]   to be a jealous God.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.440]   And for us, we wanna find a way
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.080]   to distinguish between sinful jealousy
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.040]   and loving jealousy.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.920]   So what's the difference?
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.960]   What's the sin of jealousy
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.840]   that this person who asked this question,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.520]   evidently, is feeling eaten up by?
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.440]   The first thing, I could think of three things
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.440]   that make a desire for someone's affections sinful.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.840]   One is when there's no ground for feeling jealousy.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.560]   In other words, they really aren't giving
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.120]   their affections away in any inordinate
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.080]   or inappropriate way, and you shouldn't be feeling
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.880]   the craving for their unique affections the way you are.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.000]   I think I've seen mothers, for example,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.640]   jealous of their son's affections
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.480]   when they find a girl.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.460]   And on, they start falling in love with a girl,
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.700]   and mom used to be so central
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.520]   in this little boy's affections,
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.040]   and now there's this girl who's come into his life,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.720]   and this mother doesn't have the maturity
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   to let go those affections that have to be now given
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.080]   mainly to this woman rather than to her.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.160]   That would be a sinful jealousy
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.200]   if this mother was angry at this son
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.060]   because she shouldn't be angry
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.160]   because those affections that he is giving
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.920]   to this young woman are not the mother's.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.160]   They don't belong to her.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.400]   She should let them go.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.320]   She should be thankful that they're happening.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.020]   That's the first one.
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.860]   The second one is when the anger is all out of proportion
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.440]   to the degree of the issue.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.360]   A husband might spend some time reading
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.940]   or watching television or going bowling with his friends,
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.340]   and this wife might not have the security
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.320]   to feel okay about her husband doing some other things
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.840]   besides focusing all of his attention on her.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   And so that would be a sinful jealousy
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.100]   is if she got all excessively bent out of shape.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.580]   It's okay for her to talk to him about his schedule
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.360]   and try to work out whatever seems appropriate,
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.540]   but there are kinds of jealousy
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.060]   that are out of proportion to the degree of the offense
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.240]   if it is an offense at all.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.420]   And the third one I could think of,
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.420]   the third thing that makes jealousy sin
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.700]   would be when it's flowing from a lack of trust in God
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.620]   to meet your needs, to intervene where it's needed.
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.120]   In other words, you see something happening
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.740]   where in fact maybe there is a real breach of trust
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.100]   and you're legitimately feeling jealous,
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.460]   but that jealousy which begins as something right
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.580]   can move over into something wrong
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.380]   when in fact you don't trust God with it.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.180]   So the real battle, I think,
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.060]   has to be fought at the level of trusting God.
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.860]   James 3, "If you have bitter jealousy in your hearts,
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.860]   "don't boast and be false to the truth.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.420]   "This is not the wisdom that comes down from above."
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.360]   In other words, James is saying,
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.340]   your jealousy is owing to the fact
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.260]   that you're not getting this from heaven.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.980]   This is not of the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.940]   This is not born of faith.
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.540]   This is coming from something demon-like and ugly.
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.260]   So we need to kill, I would say,
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.700]   kill sinful jealousy with godly jealousy.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.180]   Godly jealousy says, "I am jealous
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.300]   "that God get all my affections of love and trust
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.660]   "and not be given away to anybody else.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.680]   "And if God has them, then my heart will be steadied
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.080]   "and I will not crave the attention
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.080]   "that I'm sinfully craving in my jealousy of others."
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.660]   So I think really at the root,
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.380]   being eaten up with a sinful jealousy
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.380]   is probably owing to a failure to be jealous enough
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.460]   for God getting all my affections
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.740]   and all my trust and all my allegiance
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.660]   so that I can be stable and strong and restful in him.
