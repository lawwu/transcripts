[00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.600]   What do you think are not good times to come to the airport if you're planning a trip?
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.080]   Obviously key peak travel periods are important to take a look at but I
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.680]   would also say anytime you're hearing the TSA put an output into the press
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.160]   releases around you know get to airports early this weekend like listen right
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.280]   Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc. Easter spring break whatever but I would also
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.400]   just take a look at there is a website that you can check it's not always
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.320]   accurate and always great for the TSA wait times at the airport just take a
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.120]   look at that and see what kind of the trends are looking like on the day of
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.940]   your travel and see if maybe you're gonna get to the airport and be surprised
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.960]   by three-hour lines somewhere no matter what you do there are resources out
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.820]   there whether it's reddit the traditional wait times or airport specific hacks on
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.060]   how to get through different security lines faster that could work for you that
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.480]   would help you game out how you're gonna do it but I would always for each of the
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.200]   airlines that I fly when it's a new experience I always want to kind of
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.100]   understand what is my security expectation how long should I be planning on being at
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.800]   the airport ahead of time to make sure I can get through that line as fast as
