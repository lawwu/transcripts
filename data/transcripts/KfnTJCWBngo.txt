[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   Well, how do we glorify God in the little day-by-day things?
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.720]   The question comes up today.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.480]   Pastor John, hello, my name is Trent.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.960]   I've begun reading your book, Desiring God, and I understand now what you mean by Christian
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.400]   hedonism.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.000]   How wonderful it is to know that God commands our supreme happiness and joy in Him.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.840]   Paul says in 1 Corinthians 10 31, "Whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.400]   to the glory of God."
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.040]   How can I give the Lord glory by enjoying Him through food?
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.440]   Is it by knowing that the food for that day was provided for me by Him and it's okay to
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.560]   enjoy it?
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.680]   Or another example would be happiness, when our children do well in school.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.840]   I'm just wondering how to be happy in the Lord in the right way to bring Him the most
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.040]   glory.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.600]   How do I do all things to glorify God?
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.600]   Christian hedonism.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.920]   I brought up Christian hedonism.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.200]   Say a word about that.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.160]   Put everything in context here.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:12.120]   Christian hedonism teaches that every person, all of us, should seek with all of our might
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:22.440]   to maximize the intensity and the duration of our enjoyment of God above all things,
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.200]   because God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.800]   If you are most satisfied in family or job or fame or success or money or food or music
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.360]   or health or staying alive, if you are more satisfied in any of those than you are in
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.840]   God, then you diminish the glory of God and you magnify the glory of what you're most
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.920]   satisfied by.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.400]   And the Bible makes clear that we should live in order to display the supreme worth and
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   beauty and glory of God.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.040]   That's our primary reason for existence.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:14.540]   Now there are two main challenges that Satan uses to diminish the glorification of God
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:22.720]   in our lives by causing us to value something else more than we value God.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.520]   And one of those is pain, and the other is pleasure.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.480]   Those are Satan's two strategies for ruining the way we glorify God.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.080]   Pain can cause us to value something else more than God by making us angry at God that
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.420]   we have this pain and making us want to be done with it more than we want to embrace
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:54.320]   God, which means that pain is a golden opportunity for us to glorify God by showing how much
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:03.300]   more we value Him than we value comfort or being free from this pain.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.460]   Pleasure can also cause us to cherish something else more than God, not by making us angry
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:16.060]   at God, but by making us forget God because we're so satisfied in the pleasures that
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.380]   His gifts give us.
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.420]   We can see that in Ezekiel 16, 14, where God says to Israel, "And your renown went forth
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.000]   among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through the splendor that
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.700]   I had bestowed upon you, declares the Lord, but you trusted in your beauty and played
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.700]   the whore."
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.100]   In other words, God gave Israel the great gift of beauty, and instead of leading them
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.300]   to glorify God for the gift, they fell in love with the gift.
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:03.320]   They preferred the gift over the giver; they dishonored God by not being satisfied in God
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.280]   but falling in love with God's good gift.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.360]   So pain and pleasure are Satan's strategies that can ruin our glorification of God.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.700]   Withholding good things can ruin us; giving us good things can ruin us.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:32.040]   Youth can be an occasion for dishonoring God and not glorifying Him, or for indeed glorifying
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.040]   Him.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.480]   And Trent's question has to do with this last point, namely, how do you glorify God
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.880]   in the good things that He gives us, like He mentions food and children?
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.760]   If he wants a book-length answer to that, then he should read Joe Rigney's book, Things
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.460]   of Earth.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:00.080]   So I'm just going to point to a couple of passages which will give part of the answer,
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.280]   I think, to his question.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.520]   Philippians 4, 11-13, Paul says, "I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.040]   I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.680]   In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.680]   and need.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.360]   I can do all things through Him who strengthens me."
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.720]   So Paul makes clear that there is a spiritual secret, something deep and wonderful to be
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.600]   learned in the Christian life that enables a person not only to be brought low, but to
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:47.880]   abound, not only to hunger, but to have plenty, not only to be in need, but to have abundance.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:55.880]   In other words, Paul is making it clear that abounding and having plenty and having abundance
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:02.880]   is as much of a challenge to the glory of God in our lives as is suffering.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:10.640]   So Paul had to learn something peculiar and special and deep to help him know how to abound,
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.160]   and that's Trent's very question.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:23.560]   And I think Paul's answer of what the secret is for abounding is in chapter 3, verse 7
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.880]   and 8.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:33.120]   And the secret is not in discounting or diminishing the goodness of God's gifts, but in knowing
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:42.960]   Christ so well and loving Him so deeply and finding Him so satisfying that good things
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:51.120]   can be received from His hand as Christ-exalting gifts, and good things can be torn from our
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.640]   hands as Christ-exalting discipline.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.240]   Here's what he says in chapter 3, verse 7.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.440]   "Whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ."
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.720]   In other words, Christ is way better.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.240]   "Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth."
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.240]   That's the point.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.960]   "The surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.600]   For His sake, I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.800]   that I might gain Christ."
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:28.960]   The fact that good things are counted as loss or as rubbish does not mean they can't be
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:37.040]   enjoyed, but it does mean that the moment they compete with the superior beauty and
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.840]   worth and glory and satisfaction of Christ, they become an enemy.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.680]   They become rubbish.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:51.800]   But Paul has learned the secret that if Christ is more precious than anything, then both
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:59.360]   the loss and the presence, the gain of things, good things, is an occasion for treasuring
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.400]   Christ.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.720]   And the other passage that I think points to the answer is 1 Timothy 4, 4 and 5, where
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:15.560]   Paul says, "Some forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.800]   be received with thanksgiving."
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:27.680]   So foods and sex in marriage created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.280]   and know the truth.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.200]   "For everything created by God is good.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.800]   Nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, for it is made holy by
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.000]   the word of God and prayer."
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Oh, my.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.040]   Every word there almost begs for a sermon or an essay or something.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.240]   And then he adds in chapter 6, verse 17, "Don't set your hope on uncertain riches, but on
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:00.640]   God who richly provides us with everything to enjoy."
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.440]   Now I wrote an article once, ages ago, called "How to Drink Orange Juice to the Glory of
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.440]   God."
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.440]   And that's what I'm being asked.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.200]   So let's make orange juice the test case, and we'll end with just a few illustrations
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.680]   of, so how do you drink orange juice to the glory of God?
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:25.100]   Number one, I will affirm joyfully from the word of God that the color yellow is a gift
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.100]   of God.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.880]   The sweet taste is a gift of God.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.840]   The nourishment and the way my body uses it is a gift of God.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.320]   The sun and the rain that grew the oranges is a gift of God.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.520]   The trucking and the grocery chain that brought it to me is a gift of God.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.760]   And the list could go on and on.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.600]   I will gladly, joyfully say that out loud.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.120]   I will feel that.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:53.480]   Number two, I will lift my heart and voice in prayer, thanking God, and I will do this
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:00.520]   often so that others can know where all this came from and how wise and strong and good
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.520]   God is.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:07.640]   Number three, I will remind myself that I do not deserve this juice.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.040]   I deserve to be in hell today.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:18.620]   And so I will give thanks that my sins are forgiven and that this pleasure is in fact
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.720]   bought for me.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:30.360]   This orange juice pleasure is a blood bought gift for this child of God on the way to heaven.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:38.480]   Number four, I will remind myself that this particular pleasure, this taste, this coolness
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:49.820]   on my tongue, this nourishment reveals something of God to my senses and my soul that could
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.580]   not be known any other way.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.980]   That's why the world was created, because all of it is like a prism giving us some new
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.680]   sight of the glory of God.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.560]   And then finally, I will share this juice in love with others at the table.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:15.780]   I won't hoard it all, and I will use the strength that it gives me to live for the glory of God.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.780]   Orange juice to the glory of God.
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.340]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.380]   And Trent, thanks for the question.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.440]   Wonderful question.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.040]   And thanks for joining us today on the podcast.

[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.480]   God loves to work for those who wait for him, so how do we wait for God?
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.020]   And does waiting for God mean that we don't act?
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.160]   And when do we stop waiting and start acting?
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.820]   All of those are very important questions on the table next time when we return.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.820]   I'm Tony Reinke, and we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:52.820]   Thanks for listening.
