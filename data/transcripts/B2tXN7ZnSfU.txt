[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.480]   The following is a conversation with Michael Malice,
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.720]   his fifth time on this "The Lex Friedman Podcast."
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.680]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.960]   in the description.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.960]   And now, here's my New Year's Eve 2021 conversation
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.060]   with the one and only Mr. Michael Malice.
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.840]   Dostoevsky wrote in "The Idiot," my favorite of his books,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.240]   through the main character, Prince Mishkin,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.280]   that beauty will save the world.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.960]   These words, seemingly naive,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.040]   and ultimately, at least to me, profound,
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.360]   what do they mean to you?
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.680]   Beauty will save the world.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440]   - Naive? Really?
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.320]   I don't think they seem naive at all.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.400]   - Well, Sholzhenitsyn actually,
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.320]   for his 1970 Nobel Prize speech,
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.280]   talked about this line a lot.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.000]   And he thought for most of his life,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.320]   that was a silly line.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.200]   It was just words thrown out there
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.200]   because with all the suffering that's in the world,
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.640]   what has beauty actually ever done?
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.400]   - Oh my God, I hate this so much.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.240]   (laughing)
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.760]   - You're talking trash about Sholzhenitsyn.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.600]   - Yeah, I am.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.920]   - Okay.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920]   - And this perfectly sets up this theme.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.560]   You know, I said, let's do this episode,
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.600]   start the new year on a positive note,
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.300]   give people hope, give people joy.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.680]   You and I both have friends who are models, right?
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.720]   And it's a silly profession to some extent, of course, but-
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.760]   - You are actually a model.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.160]   You are my friend.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.000]   - That's right, that's true.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.920]   I am an under model.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.720]   I was trying to be subtle.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.960]   But for those people who actually, you know,
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.720]   deserve to be models,
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.080]   when you look at someone who is a model
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.880]   and in some of their photos,
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.360]   and these people look perfect.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.760]   Now in real life, they're not perfect.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.580]   They have flaws.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.360]   They'll be the first to admit it, so on and so forth.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.560]   But when you look at beauty,
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.560]   it is almost impossible to maintain a sense of cynicism
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.520]   and hopelessness.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.720]   Because if there's even one moment when some element
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.220]   of perfection has been actualized,
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.920]   if there's one moment where beauty has been realized
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.800]   and captured, you can't say,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.400]   well, it's never gonna happen again.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.240]   So I think beauty, it means hope.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.240]   I think I hate that cynical idea of like,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.560]   I get, I appreciate Solzhenitsyn's broader point
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.760]   in that a lot of times people,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.200]   there's something called the deepity,
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.880]   where people throw words together to sound profound.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.920]   And if you take it apart,
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.840]   like this is just complete gibberish.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.640]   I don't think this is an example of that.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.920]   I think beauty inspires, and more importantly,
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.680]   it proves to you this is something
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.560]   that can actually happen on this Earth.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.000]   Plato, right, the Platonic theory of forms,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.720]   like this world is imperfect,
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.200]   but these perfect forms exist in another dimension,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.440]   and that's where our concepts come from.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.440]   You know, he was an early person trying to figure out
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.680]   where our concepts come from,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.680]   and epistemology and so on and so forth.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.480]   But that is something that is real in here.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.380]   So I completely disagree with his analysis of that,
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.120]   and I don't know if it'll save the world,
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.880]   but it's certainly a prerequisite.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.920]   And what's the point of fighting for your values
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.440]   if you don't wanna make the world a more beautiful place?
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.840]   - Well, it's also how you define beauty,
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.760]   'cause beauty could be just aesthetic beauty,
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.920]   it could be art.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.640]   Of course, art could encompass a lot,
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.560]   a lot more than just literature and paintings.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.560]   It can encompass the full life, the full dance of life.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.760]   But then beauty could be something just deeper,
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.220]   like whatever that awe you feel
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.800]   when you pause and hear the music,
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.880]   just hear and look up at the stars.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.320]   Like for some reason when I see rockets go up,
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.620]   for me it's like science.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.720]   What is that?
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.000]   The awe that we're able to accomplish that as humans.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.800]   - You know, that's funny, 'cause there's lots
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.000]   of different schools of thought,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.940]   like these people versus these people,
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.940]   and maybe vegans versus steakhouse people.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.140]   I think in terms of the sciences,
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.760]   and I guess you and I would be on opposite sides here,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.760]   you have the astronomy people versus the zoology people.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.440]   Like the big question is,
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.080]   would you rather spend 10 minutes on the moon,
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.920]   or would you rather spend 10 minutes in the deep sea?
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.640]   And for me, it's clearly the deep sea.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.560]   The zoology that's down there,
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.780]   there's something I would encourage people to look up
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.560]   called deep staria, which is a jellyfish.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.480]   And the scientists, what's amazing
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.640]   when you watch these deep sea dives on YouTube,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.720]   is that the scientists, they're nature dorks
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.080]   like everybody else, they went into this field,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.400]   and there's none of this maybe soljohnishin style cynicism
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.960]   of when they see an amazing animal
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.640]   in its natural environment exhibiting these crazy behaviors,
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.480]   they lose it.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.760]   They're on the mic like, oh my god!
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.440]   Like it's so exciting to watch.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.480]   So I'm not a rocket person,
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.240]   but I'm definitely a zoology person.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.600]   - So animals and plants and the sea.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.180]   - And also it's so mathematical.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.640]   There's so many forms.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.280]   There's this plant called Areospermum titanopsoides.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.200]   I don't know how to pronounce it,
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.040]   'cause they're always in Latin.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.920]   You never hear them pronounced.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.960]   - You said sperm.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   - Areospermum, yeah, 'cause it's a woolly seed is the genus.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.120]   The leaf, it's just always puts out one leaf,
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.360]   but the leaf is covered in little magnifying glasses,
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.360]   lenses, to make it maximize the sunlight.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.120]   So it looks like this little crystal seashell.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.000]   It's tiny, it's like two centimeters,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.120]   but it's just this amazing thing
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   that grows out of the sands in South Africa.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.920]   - Just to defend Solzhenitsyn for a second,
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.000]   so if I may read a couple of his lines from the speech.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.840]   - Sure.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.400]   - So he said, "One day," this is how he introduces it,
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.600]   "One day, Dostoevsky threw out the enigmatic remark,
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.780]   "'Beauty will save the world.'
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.360]   "What sort of a statement is that?
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.200]   "For a long time, I considered it mere words.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.840]   "How could that be possible?
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.800]   "When in bloodthirsty history,
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.260]   "did beauty ever save anyone from anything?"
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.220]   And then later, he goes on to argue with himself
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.680]   in the speech, "As a older, wiser man now,
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.500]   "but perhaps that ancient trinity of truth, goodness,
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.540]   "and beauty is not simply an empty, faded formula,
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.780]   "as we thought in the days of our self-confident,
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.820]   "materialistic youth.
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.120]   "If the tops of these three trees converge,"
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.860]   as the scholars maintained,
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.980]   "but the two blatant, two direct stems
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.240]   "of truth and goodness are crushed, cut down,
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.140]   "not allowed through, then perhaps the fantastic,
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.940]   "unpredictable, unexpected stems of beauty
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.040]   "will push through and soar to that very same place,
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.160]   "and in so doing, will fulfill the work of all three.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.600]   "In that case, Dostoevsky's remark,
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.120]   "'Beauty will save the world,'
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.880]   "was not a careless phrase, but a prophecy.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.360]   "Which of these three things are your favorites,
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.640]   "truth, goodness, or beauty?"
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.840]   What did he call truth and goodness?
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.780]   The blatant, two direct stems of truth and goodness,
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.080]   versus the fantastic, unpredictable,
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.880]   unexpected stems of beauty,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.440]   which is how I see your Twitter account.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.880]   - I don't think, I think there's certain
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.280]   truth and beauty if you had my Twitter account,
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.400]   that's for sure.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.700]   It's certainly no goodness.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.040]   - Or truth.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.700]   (laughing)
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.400]   It's Twitter, there's no truth to be found.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.800]   I would, I will answer the question.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.160]   I will, of course, point out that having this kind of,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.120]   you know, distinction between the three things
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.520]   is, I think, kind of synthetic.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.140]   I think they very heavily overlap.
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.200]   If not, I can probably make the argument
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.100]   they're synonymous.
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.900]   In fact, I do believe that they're largely synonymous.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:05.720]   - Goodness, that's such an interesting word, goodness.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.940]   Which of those three is my favorite?
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:14.520]   I think truth is overrated in the sense that
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.680]   if something is a good story,
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.120]   the story doesn't have to be true or real
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.420]   in order to motivate you and move you.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:31.160]   A lot of times, we can delude ourselves about somebody
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.560]   and that might actually serve a purpose to some extent.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.760]   You know, if you have someone who's maybe a family member
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.600]   and you kind of ignore bad things that they do,
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.260]   there might be a reason for that.
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.220]   Of the three, which is most important?
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.020]   I think, I would say probably goodness.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.540]   I would say of the three, the most important is goodness
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.140]   because if you don't appreciate goodness,
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.200]   then beauty is just empty.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.600]   It's just a picture or it's nice.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.320]   Bad people appreciate beauty.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:11.120]   Bad people are often seductive or have a beauty about them.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.440]   - And in terms of action, I think it takes a lot of skill
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.760]   and work to create beauty or to create truth
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.920]   or to express truth or to express beauty.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.440]   But I think goodness is,
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:27.300]   it's like the easiest default state of being,
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.440]   just being good to others.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.560]   - Yeah, like, you know, there'll be things where,
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.560]   these videos where like one dog is drowning
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.840]   and like another dog jumps in and saves it from the pool.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.320]   Like that to me is just really amazing stuff
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.540]   and is very moving.
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:49.440]   So just, to me, goodness means integrity
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.100]   and it means kindness.
[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.600]   And yeah, I think of the three,
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.560]   that's my, would be the one I pick.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.320]   - Yeah, you actually-- - And I think people,
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.160]   I'm sorry to interrupt.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.920]   People also have this idea, which is inculcated to them,
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.080]   especially by corporate America,
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.240]   that as you get older, it's okay to do the wrong thing
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.040]   sometimes, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.080]   I don't buy that.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.480]   And so I think goodness gets rarer and rarer.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.360]   And I think people know better and they tell themselves lies.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.880]   - Yeah, but once you get, allow yourself the chance
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.560]   to just be good, I think it makes for a better life.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.400]   - Yeah.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.600]   - It's not that much work.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.740]   Like it's not like going to the gym and working out.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.720]   That's a lot of work and it's great afterwards.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.720]   But like goodness is easy once you get into the habit of it.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.680]   I suppose working out is the same way.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.520]   There's a lot of stuff.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.280]   If you make it a habit, you're going to get the rewards
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.580]   of it and it's going to be easy.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.340]   - The rewards of goodness, I think, are more immediate
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.720]   than the rewards of working out.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.220]   - As opposed to the hard drugs.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.060]   - Yeah.
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.320]   - If, you mentioned this quote on one of your live streams,
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.800]   I think, "If you save one life, you save the world."
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.640]   - Yeah.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.160]   - That's such a cool line.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.720]   I think, I remember reading about Paul Farmer.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.480]   I think his name is, he's a doctor that really,
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.720]   I mean, doctors in general, they kind of don't care
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.440]   about like what they're doing as a broad policy
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.240]   across hundreds of thousands of millions of people.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.400]   They just care about the human in front of them,
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.560]   which is so interesting.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.300]   They don't care it's going to cost, like in his case,
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.800]   to save one child, it will cost him hundreds
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.120]   of thousands of dollars.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.320]   They don't care about that.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.160]   They can't.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.160]   They know very well that their actions cannot be scaled,
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.840]   but they can't help but help the child in front of them.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.080]   And it's so interesting.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.600]   That's such an interesting way to live.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.760]   And that's the way I kind of think when I try
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.760]   to do something positive is, will this help one person?
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.500]   And I just kind of imagine a specific person,
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.060]   depending on the thing, that that would help with.
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.800]   Like when I'm trying to create something,
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.180]   whether it's a piece of hardware or a video
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.220]   or anything like that, or educational material,
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.620]   lecture, that kind of stuff.
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.140]   I don't know, what do you think about this quote?
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.120]   Is it profound or is it just poetic?
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.740]   - I think it's more profound than it sounds at first.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.540]   The example I think of is Michelle Bachman.
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.980]   She was a former congresswoman from Minnesota.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.600]   She clearly had crazy eyes.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.640]   Something was going on with her husband.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.300]   But she adopted like 20 kids.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.780]   Terry Shappert's another friend of mine.
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.620]   He's like a either Navy SEAL or Marines,
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.700]   whatever it is, Terry, I apologize.
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.020]   I'm not trying to be funny.
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.320]   And he adopts like elder dogs.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.120]   So going back to Bachman, it's like, yeah,
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.380]   you can say she's crazy.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.380]   You can make fun of her politics all you want,
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.060]   and all that stuff's legitimate.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.420]   But if you save a kid, give them a home,
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.640]   and you save them from the foster system,
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.100]   and you put a roof over their heads
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.020]   and make them feel loved and appreciated,
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.980]   it's really hard for me to sit here
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.380]   and call you like a totally bad person.
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.820]   I think that kind of thing is,
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.960]   Nick Surcey's another one.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.940]   He adopted a kid.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.980]   And I said, I think you're a hero.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.260]   Like if you, there's some, you know,
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.220]   one of the things that's very hard for me in writing,
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.660]   as you know, I talk about this endlessly,
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.920]   this book, "The White Pill."
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.920]   But writing about when people do hurtful things to children,
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.020]   it really is hard to watch.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.780]   And it's hard to, 'cause when you're an author,
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.420]   you have to kind of empathize with the character.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.380]   You have to, where's this character coming from?
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.780]   Explain their point of view.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.160]   And that's the one that's the hardest
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.860]   for me to wrap my head around.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.980]   - Cruelty to children.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.500]   - Yeah, or, and yeah, sadism to children.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.900]   It's just like, this is something even animals
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.020]   know not to do, do you know what I mean?
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.140]   Like dogs, when you see them around kids,
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.260]   they're very protective.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.460]   If the kid pokes their eyes out,
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.900]   the dog doesn't do anything.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.920]   So it's like, if you can't even get to that level,
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.540]   what kind of person are you?
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.380]   So I think that quote is a profound one,
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.060]   and it's an important one.
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:06.360]   It also means we're not all called upon to be Superman.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.780]   Right, you only have very finite ability to move the needle.
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.540]   But at the same time, if you have actually saved a life,
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.140]   you can go to meet your maker, you did your part.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.220]   You left the world a little bit better than you found it.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.060]   And that's all you could ask anybody.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.860]   - Also, I think from a policy perspective,
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.820]   it seems we just do better when we focus
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.820]   on doing a small thing, helping one person.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.020]   'Cause it feels like when you start talking about communism
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:34.900]   and all those kinds of things,
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.720]   when you start to believe you could do good
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.660]   by a lot of people, that's where your mind somehow
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.020]   stops being able to do good by a lot of people.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.500]   That's when you start to think about utopias
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.140]   and somehow utopias goes to,
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.500]   feeds power into the brain to where it deludes you
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.340]   completely and then you start,
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.380]   it's okay to crack a few eggs to make an omelet
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.100]   kind of reasoning and you run into trouble.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.020]   It seems like it's much better,
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.980]   even when you have the power and the money and so on,
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.260]   to achieve scale, to focus on one.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.580]   - Or locally, yeah.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.980]   - Locally, yeah.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.780]   - Because then, so you have the feedback.
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.620]   - Exactly.
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.460]   - So if you have some kind of program in Austin
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.100]   or Brooklyn or something like that,
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.580]   and you can watch, oh, this is working, this isn't working,
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.140]   and you can port it out to other places,
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.940]   but top-down helping is, at the very least,
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.980]   it's gonna be inefficient.
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.100]   And also, I think it's a lot more useful
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.380]   when you're helping people,
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.780]   when it's a one-on-one relationship,
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.140]   because then it's less, I don't know, embarrassing,
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.700]   but certainly less something to receive help.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.020]   And you also feel, it's one thing if you get a check
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.900]   from the government, food stamps,
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.060]   it's another thing if someone's like,
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.420]   hey, I'm gonna buy you groceries
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.780]   until you get back on your feet.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.540]   You have this kind of motivation, I think,
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.420]   for most people to be like, you know what,
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.980]   this person believed in me,
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.580]   I'm gonna make it worth their while
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.980]   that they believed in me.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.620]   'Cause I didn't believe in me.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.980]   - Yeah, when I was giving lectures at MIT,
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.860]   there was one, I was scared shitless.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.140]   And I mean, everybody, you know how students are
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.380]   and all that kind of stuff, they're kind of bored.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.500]   And they don't understand that you're human too.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.500]   Yeah. (laughs)
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.860]   Or this could be just me.
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.780]   - I don't understand you're trying to pass as human.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.980]   - I know.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.580]   But there's one gentleman in the audience,
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.980]   and he went to all the lectures,
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.780]   all the gentlemen, he was a faculty at MIT.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.540]   And he just, without, very kind of nonchalant,
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.740]   just said, after the lectures,
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.240]   he would kind of nod at me and say, you did great.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.140]   And before, like one time he said,
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.060]   in a non-creepy way, I know this is gonna come off
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.660]   as creepy, he said, you look great today.
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.460]   Like he said that in a, I don't, in the way,
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.320]   so he's like 60, 70, whatever, like he,
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.460]   in this, I don't know, it's in a wise sage way.
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.420]   'Cause I was wearing a suit and tie.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.180]   Like I look like, you know when you dress up
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.860]   like a young kid, you dress 'em up for--
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:57.700]   - The barbit's festival, yeah.
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.520]   You go to your barbit's festival, yeah.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.500]   - So he was just like, all right, you're all dressed up,
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.300]   you look great, you got this.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.380]   I don't know, that has a lasting impact,
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.260]   that kind of pat on the back.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:13.260]   But I agree with you, cruelty towards other adults
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.300]   is somehow understandable.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.340]   'Cause it's a world full of conflict,
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:23.240]   but cruelty towards children doesn't,
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.380]   it doesn't quite, I can't understand it.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.340]   I can't understand how you could act in a way
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.560]   that directly causes suffering to a child in front of you.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.140]   - Yeah, that is, I don't think I've ever talked to you,
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.140]   this might be a good time to ask you about this.
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.980]   What do you make, what lessons do you draw
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.020]   about human civilization from Jeffrey Epstein?
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:52.100]   From just laying, everybody thinks about different things.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.580]   When you talk to Eric Weinstein,
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.340]   he thinks about intelligence and like who,
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.540]   like Jeffrey Epstein is a front for something else.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.420]   That's what he thinks about.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.580]   - I think about the weakness of grown men
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.260]   in the face of charismatic evil,
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.860]   which is like for me directly is MIT.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.060]   I didn't know, I actually was,
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.940]   I guess I was at MIT when Jeffrey Epstein
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.580]   was just at the very end.
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.860]   He must've been there.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.860]   I didn't know any of this, but it really bothers me
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.180]   that nobody was able to see through this man.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.100]   Because he's obviously, what is also obvious to me
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.980]   is that he was very charismatic.
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.980]   Like, I mean, I try to think about human nature
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:41.260]   from this perspective is directly,
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.820]   like we said, help one life.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:48.400]   Would I know a Jeffrey Epstein if he was in my life?
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.060]   Would I know evil when I saw evil?
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.940]   - Even if it's sitting across from you.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:57.940]   - Even, I mean, you, so, exactly, the evil laugh,
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.180]   thank you, the thing.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.840]   (both laughing)
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.580]   - Well, there's-- - It's a necronomicon.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.780]   - Well, the thing, I'm sure we'll talk about it,
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.220]   maybe not, it doesn't really matter.
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.020]   We see things, you and I, Michael,
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.740]   very differently about a lot of things,
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.820]   politically and so on.
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.380]   The reason I like you a lot,
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.620]   the reason I like the people I do in my life
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.980]   is there's a warmth, there's a kindness,
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.060]   there's a humanity underneath it all.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.460]   I don't really care what you believe.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.900]   I don't care what your Twitter says.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.020]   It's easy to mistake your Twitter to indicate
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.660]   that there's not a deeply human love for humanity in there,
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.100]   and that's why I'm detecting that.
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.060]   I think I would be able to detect that Jeffrey Epstein--
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.300]   - You say detect, I'm just imagining the T-1000.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.380]   (laughing)
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.660]   - Detected, yes.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.700]   I imagine, I hope I would be able to detect
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.700]   that Epstein lacks that completely.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.840]   Even if he's charismatic in the humor he has,
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.580]   even if he is charismatic in the expression of curiosity
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.180]   for science, which he did, he was curious about,
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:15.260]   not just boring minutiae of science,
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.720]   he was interested about the big questions in science,
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.100]   which I could see that become exciting to scientists.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.980]   Oh, wow, here's a person who's thinking big.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.140]   That's always exciting.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.260]   When somebody goes into a room and thinks about
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.080]   how do we solve intelligence,
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.900]   how do we travel faster than the speed of light,
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.780]   that's exciting to people, especially people with money,
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.860]   'cause it's like, all right,
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.260]   so we might be able to actually do big things here.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.420]   But you could see through the bullshit,
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.780]   the deadness in the eyes, I don't know.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.940]   So I think about that because I feel like
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.580]   I have the responsibility for me as an individual
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.180]   to detect evil.
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.020]   So do you know who Michael Alig is?
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.900]   Okay, this is gonna be a whole long,
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.220]   this is gonna be on Lex Clips,
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.740]   but this is a whole long story.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.060]   So there was a scene in New York in the '90s
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.020]   called The Club Kids.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.820]   And they would go out to different nightclubs at night,
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.620]   they would all dress in really kind of crazy costumes.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.900]   But the costumes were all goofy,
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.500]   and just like an angel, this was dressed like a nurse,
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.820]   there was a juvenile aspect to it.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:24.700]   They're all taking ketamine and ecstasy to all hours,
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.700]   this is kind of, rape culture was coming up in there.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.700]   And the head of it, and in fact, there's a clip on YouTube,
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.940]   I think it was the Jane Whitney Show of The Club Kids
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.980]   and Gigi Allen.
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.260]   Gigi Allen is a kind of punk rock performer,
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.460]   hard rock performer, who passed away.
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.940]   And Gigi Allen was very aggressive and like a crazy person.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.500]   My friend once saw him in a concert,
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:55.060]   and he took a dump on stage, smeared it all over his face,
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.500]   grabbed the girl from the audience, gave her a big kiss.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.300]   And as she walked by him, she just went like this,
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.620]   like, excuse me, like went to the bathroom.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.540]   So the audience is screaming at Gigi Allen
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.780]   because he's very visibly over the top.
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.940]   Whereas you got a bunch of these kids
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.700]   dressed in these silly costumes, you guys just having fun.
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.380]   Well, the head of The Club Kids, Michael Allig,
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.020]   ended up killing someone.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.940]   There was a kid called Angel Menendez
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.140]   who hung around with them.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.660]   He would always have angel wings and boots.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.700]   One time they're at Michael's condo
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:26.180]   with a drug dealer named Freeze.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.700]   They got into a fight.
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.500]   Angel got hit in the head with a hammer.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.660]   They kill him.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.420]   What are we gonna do with the body?
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.380]   They put it on ice in the bathtub.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.500]   They had a party.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.740]   So everyone's going to the bathroom
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.340]   while Angel's body's there.
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.700]   Michael got, they're like, all right,
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.620]   we gotta take care of this.
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.220]   Michael got extremely high on heroin,
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.660]   had like cutlery from Macy's,
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.220]   sawed the body in pieces, put in a box.
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.300]   They took him in a cab.
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.860]   The cab driver helped them throw the body into the river.
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.940]   And then Michael starts walking around Manhattan
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.460]   wearing Angel's boots and would tell people,
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.420]   oh, I killed Angel.
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.620]   Now, because he was a super effeminate,
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.660]   over the top, like he would pee in people's beer kinda guy,
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.780]   everyone's like, oh God, Michael,
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.660]   like you and your stupid pranks.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.260]   But it was true.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.300]   And he got caught and he got sentenced to jail.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.580]   So I was in a store in Manhattan in Soho.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.540]   And it was one of those stores
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.420]   where you have like all sorts of things for sale.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.860]   And I saw a painting and it said "Malice."
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.100]   And I'm like, wait, what?
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.100]   And it was M. Alec.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.420]   It was a Michael Alec painting.
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.660]   He had painted while in jail.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.340]   So my mom bought it for me for my birthday.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.900]   I don't remember what birthday it was.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.980]   And I started writing him in prison.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.060]   He was gonna write a memoir called "Allegula,"
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.300]   which is clever.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.700]   And then I actually went to visit him.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.300]   Like, I wanna see what this person's like.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.100]   'Cause on one hand, he's king of New York nightlife,
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.740]   this goofy person.
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.980]   And it's also kind of ironic that G.G. Allen is like,
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.620]   maybe he's gross, he's not killing anybody.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.940]   He's probably an accountant off the stage.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.620]   And Michael Alec actually did kill someone
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.900]   and then bragged about it tongue in cheek.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:57.220]   So, but meeting him, he passed away last December,
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.100]   on Christmas actually, Christmas 2020.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:06.660]   He was clearly a sociopath.
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.380]   And I'd never met a sociopath before.
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.060]   Now, a lot of times you'll read these,
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.660]   like you'll take a BuzzFeed quiz, like,
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.660]   are you a sociopath?
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.660]   And it's like, oh, my feelings weren't hurt
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.180]   when I was meeting someone.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:22.180]   It's not a thin line between like me and you and him.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.660]   It's a thick, thick line.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.620]   Because when you're talking to someone like that,
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.180]   at least in this specific case,
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.260]   he was being very friendly.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.140]   He wasn't, and it's not like he was gonna kill anyone
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.180]   or as a threat to me.
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:37.500]   But there's that sense, like something's really off here.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.500]   And he was talking to me about how after he had killed Angel,
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:46.420]   he would just talk about it because he felt so much guilt,
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.660]   he just wanted to get caught.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.300]   It's like, no, no, no, what he was describing wasn't guilt.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.580]   He was describing just, he didn't like the knife
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.980]   over his head, like waiting to get caught.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.540]   I'm like, you don't even know what guilt is?
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.820]   So it was kind of like, oh, wow.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.020]   So as for Jeffrey Epstein, but the thing is,
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.820]   Michael Elling was in a very low social position.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.100]   And the thing is when someone is powerful,
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.820]   very high status, and they do something,
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.340]   we are, as kind of hierarchical animals,
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.780]   we kind of defer to their norms.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.220]   So if you're at a party with, let's suppose,
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.180]   either of us, and it's like a Jeffrey Epstein party,
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.860]   and everyone at the party is doing some sort of weird drug
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.340]   we've never heard of,
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.700]   we wouldn't really feel comfortable judging them
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.900]   because their norms kind of become the norm for that space.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.900]   The lesson for me about Jeffrey Epstein,
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.500]   there's a lot of them, because I think this,
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.580]   to me, the biggest moment was the Amy Rohrbach situation.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.180]   Amy Rohrbach was caught on a hot mic saying
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.980]   that they had all the goods on him, they had all the names,
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.580]   and that Buckingham Palace called them.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.260]   They killed the story 'cause they weren't gonna get
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.180]   a Meghan Markle interview out of it.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.580]   So that, the willingness of those in power
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.740]   to do the wrong thing for the flimsiest pretext,
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.860]   I think was a big, important lesson.
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.380]   Also the fact that no one at ABC
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.500]   had any consequences for this.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.620]   In fact, the only person who got in trouble for all this
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.500]   was someone who used to work at ABC,
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.940]   went to, I believe, CBS, and they got fired from CBS
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.020]   because apparently they had access to footage at one point,
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.340]   even though they weren't the ones who had leaked it.
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.260]   So whistleblowers are, like, the only,
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.820]   for example, the case in Eric Garner,
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:41.460]   the guy who was selling Lucy cigarettes in New York City,
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.900]   who was arrested, he had a heart attack
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.940]   or whatever it was on the way to jail, he died.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.900]   The only person, so the cops had a situation,
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.780]   the only person who had gotten in trouble 'cause of that
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.460]   was the guy filming it, like, he went to jail.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.900]   So I think there is, if there's a lesson in terms of,
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.140]   look at Julian Assange, right?
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.340]   There's a huge amount of power exercised by elites
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.060]   to make sure that what is done on the cover of darkness
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.900]   remains on the cover of darkness.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.900]   And also Kevin McCarthy, who is currently
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.420]   the House Minority Leader, leader of the Republicans,
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.860]   he wrote a letter to ABC News, like, you had this guy,
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.900]   maybe you couldn't call in the authorities,
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.140]   but you could have leaked it to somebody,
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.140]   why hasn't anything come forward?
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.740]   Nothing happened as a result of this.
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.100]   We also have to keep in mind that the longest serving
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.740]   Republican Speaker of the House in history,
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.140]   Dennis Hastert, went to jail 'cause of things related
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.660]   to pedophilia and things like that.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.940]   So as Russians, and this is something I think
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.180]   you and I have mentioned before,
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.420]   Americans are very naive, often, decreasingly so,
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.100]   about the nature of evil.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.700]   They think an evil person is someone
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.940]   who's like getting kickbacks, or, you know,
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.980]   the Cuomos are colluding, something like that,
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.740]   I would hardly even call that evil.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.580]   No, no, this is the sort of things that are so depraved
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.620]   that you would never think about it in a million years,
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.260]   in your own home, you don't think in these terms.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.700]   And I think they get off on doing things
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.060]   that if the average person heard about it,
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.820]   the average person would be shocked,
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.100]   'cause that gives them this sense of we're above them,
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.140]   we're different from them.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.260]   The rules don't apply to us.
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.500]   - There's a lot to say here.
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.660]   So what is the norm thing you said at a party?
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:20.580]   It's really interesting for an NRK-ass to say that.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.540]   - Well, no, it's--
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.100]   - No, well, I know, I know, I'm not sorry,
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.460]   that came off as criticism, I meant it as harsh criticism.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.740]   (both laughing)
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.380]   No, I think about that a lot,
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:37.740]   as I find myself in situations where I'm invited
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:42.420]   to these kinds of parties where people have nice things,
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.420]   and I find it deeply uncomfortable for that reason.
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.340]   I don't want to be sort of an activist
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.140]   that goes in and ruins a party.
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:55.140]   That's, I think that's not the courageous act.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.580]   Neither is it courageous
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.140]   when everyone's doing some weird drug
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.380]   that you mentioned to join in, I think.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:06.380]   Courageous is more being your, remaining yourself,
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:10.140]   sticking to your principles calmly in that room
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.700]   where everybody is doing the drug.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.100]   And just don't do the drug.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.980]   Don't make a scene about it, but also don't do it.
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.300]   And I think that little act of courage over time
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.100]   is the way you resist Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:25.500]   Exactly the thing you said is probably the situation
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.980]   where charisma works.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.780]   So one charismatic person gets a little crowd going,
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:34.780]   and the crowd is everybody sort of establishes a norm
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.380]   at the little crowd.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.260]   And yes, there could be some dynamics
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.340]   that allow that norm to be established.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.660]   Like you said, like rich and powerful people
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.580]   might enjoy being rich and powerful
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.780]   and better than everybody else kind of thing.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:55.020]   But like I, especially for scientists,
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.620]   I thought they should have integrity and courage enough
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:02.940]   to see through that, not again as an activist,
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.780]   like so you can tweet about it, how courageous you are,
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.900]   but just literally, see, there's something off here.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.820]   There's something off here,
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:10.660]   and I'm not going to participate in it.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.340]   - I'm gonna defend these scientists
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.300]   because something off, first of all--
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.620]   - You're always defending academia, it's disgusting.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.860]   - It's my favorite thing.
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.140]   I think that, first of all,
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.020]   this is gonna sound like a joke, and it's not,
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:28.020]   I bet you 90% of those MIT scientists are on the spectrum,
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.780]   so everyone they're gonna meet is gonna be off, right?
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.060]   So I'm sure part of their brain is like,
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.260]   okay, this person's weird,
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.540]   this is just them being on the spectrum.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.100]   - Like the light spectrum,
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.100]   I couldn't even finish the joke, okay, go.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.540]   (laughing)
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:44.540]   - Number two is off, we tend to, there's this poem,
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:48.860]   I forget who wrote it, it was like Nick Cave or something,
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.900]   and it was describing, I think it was Goebbels,
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.220]   hair, normal, height, normal, weight, normal,
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.820]   what do you expect, horns, right?
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.500]   So when you meet someone, you think something's off,
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.740]   there's gonna be a bell curve of what that could be, right?
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.580]   It could be that they're twitchy,
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.460]   or maybe they're completely asocial,
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.140]   and then you have Jeffrey Epstein over here,
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.580]   you're gonna need a lot of evidence to be like,
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.620]   oh, I feel something off,
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.820]   therefore this guy's the head of an international
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.140]   sex trafficking ring.
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.360]   So yeah, you might be like, okay,
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.600]   but at the same time, if the extent of your relationship is
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.680]   this guy is interested in my work,
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.040]   he's gonna fund my work,
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.480]   and I don't have to give him anything in return,
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.480]   he's clearly intelligent, he's appreciating it,
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.000]   and being a scientist is a thankless job.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.080]   I know what it's like as an author,
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.420]   when I was writing Dear Reader, the North Korea book,
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:39.520]   my friends were sick of hearing
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.920]   all these North Korea anecdotes,
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.600]   'cause at a certain point, it's like, okay, we get it,
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.740]   just save it for the book,
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.200]   and you gotta be in that lab,
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.280]   you're looking at the springtails,
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.240]   whatever it is you're looking at,
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.520]   no one knows what a springtail is.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.640]   - I just disagree with you,
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.280]   so that'd be interesting to draw the distinction
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.020]   between science and writing,
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.120]   because the scientific process itself is fun as fuck.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.440]   You're solving little puzzles.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.280]   - Sure.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.680]   - So in itself, it's fun, so it's rewarding.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.920]   The reason you go into science is you can continue,
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.200]   really without a boss,
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.060]   to continue having fun and solving puzzles.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:19.100]   So unless you become cynical and tired
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.920]   of the whole thing, so the people, the administration,
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.760]   or when you're running a large lab,
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.520]   and what you get sick of is the emails and the meetings
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.440]   and all that kind of stuff,
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.440]   the actual act of being in the lab is still fun as fuck.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.320]   If you allow it to be, writing, I feel like,
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.040]   there's more priority to publishing.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.880]   Would you enjoy it, the tree falling in the forest,
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.360]   would you still enjoy any of the books you've written
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.080]   if they never got published?
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.100]   - Not to the same extent, not even close.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:49.940]   - Right.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.980]   I think that the thing about science,
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.780]   it's almost like you get a peek into the mysterious.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.820]   - Yeah, but this is, okay, this is where I'm coming from.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:03.100]   Since moving to Austin, I bought over 150 plants.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:05.700]   - Look how you're doing the politician thing.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.680]   - Look, let me be clear, all right?
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.220]   It's not--
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:15.040]   - You are running in 2024, this is very interesting.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.980]   - I bought 150 succulents for my house.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.440]   They're thriving here in Austin
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.620]   as they wouldn't have in Brooklyn.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.220]   - You have a great video about it.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.100]   - One of those plants I have is the photo I took
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.380]   on my Instagram, there's no other photos
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.360]   on the whole internet.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.000]   None of my friends care.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.460]   Or they care ostensibly, but that's cool.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.900]   I have a better plant collection in my house
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.600]   than almost any botanical, succulent collection
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.220]   than any botanical garden in America
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.340]   other than probably the Huntington, and no one cares.
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.980]   - This is what ego looks like, by the way.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.120]   - I can prove it to you.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.300]   - No, I know, but you don't have to rub it in.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.900]   - Well, they have a big budget.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.700]   I don't, so if I can put it together,
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.260]   they should be able to.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.220]   So I can only imagine that a scientist
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:57.380]   who studied those spiders that look like ants,
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:01.340]   like, oh, and this species does this
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.960]   with the gender dimorphism,
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.700]   their friends are only gonna care so much.
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.700]   So if you meet someone who has a lot of money
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.060]   who now cares about ant spiders,
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:09.900]   it's gonna be exciting for you.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.220]   - Yeah, it will be very exciting.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.060]   But I just wanted to push back on the,
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.500]   I think the act itself should be the biggest reward.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.940]   I think you're always safe.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:24.120]   We're talking about goodness being a safe default.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:28.380]   I think a good default for plants
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.600]   and for writing and for science
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.060]   is to just enjoy the act even if nobody cares.
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.560]   - Okay, this is where, okay, now I'm even,
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.740]   now I'm wondering why I'm pushing back so hard,
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.360]   and I realize what it was.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.420]   Because I've made this point several times,
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.100]   and I'm glad I can make it again.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.180]   There's this window of time that happened in my life,
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.140]   and I know it happens to a lot of people,
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.280]   when you're in your 24 to 27, 28, right?
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.980]   So 21 to 24, you still have your friends from college,
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.460]   so on and so forth, right?
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.860]   But then it's kind of like a poker game,
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.100]   and every so often, people cash out.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:03.940]   They're like, I'm out, I'm out.
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.740]   They get married, they get a job, they move.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.020]   And if you are someone who's a young, ambitious creative,
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.180]   that window is a very rough one
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.540]   because you're doing the right thing, right?
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.980]   And you're not being a drug addict,
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.300]   you're not being a philanderer.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.260]   Not that those things are wrong,
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.580]   but just like you're playing by the rules.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.300]   You're creating your stuff,
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.860]   what you wanna be known for,
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.820]   contribution you wanna make for the world,
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.420]   and no one cares, and it gets very lonely.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.060]   And there's this very emotional disconnect
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:36.840]   about how is it that I'm creating, and I'm working hard,
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.420]   and I'm making something happen,
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.100]   and it's just radio silence.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.540]   So that, I don't think it's that easy
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.460]   when you're the scientist, not me,
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.380]   when you don't have any kind of external validation.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.700]   Humans only have so much fuel.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.500]   - Nothing worth having is easy, Michael.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.500]   By the way, yesterday, talked on the phone
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.600]   with a person who said he was deeply moved
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.860]   the first time you mentioned this age group of 24 to 27.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.180]   He's like, he's 26, he said,
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.700]   and he feels the full responsibility of that.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.780]   So he left his corporate typey job
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.180]   to pursue something that he's really passionate about,
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.700]   and that was, you were an inspiration to him,
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.180]   which I was deeply saddened by that.
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.740]   - I also inspired Michael Alex.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.980]   (laughing)
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:30.780]   - The amount of mass murder,
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.180]   those that were inspired by you,
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.480]   will eventually lead to is truly horrifying.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.820]   What were we talking about?
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:41.020]   So Jeffrey Epstein, oh, one thing I wanted to ask you,
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.980]   so let's put scientists aside.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:48.900]   What about world leaders, Bill Clinton,
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.500]   your favorite person?
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.700]   Why would he fly with Jeffrey Epstein?
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.300]   Why would he interact with that guy?
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.940]   - I mean, don't you think that that's kind of the deal,
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:05.740]   that I'm the president, and I get big and powerful people
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.900]   fly me around in their jets,
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.100]   and that's a symbiotic relationship?
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.620]   - Yeah, but don't you also have a good BS detector?
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.940]   Don't you have a good detector for people
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.420]   who just wanna be in your presence?
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.860]   Like, I already understand
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.740]   that there's people like this out there.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.460]   There's people that kinda wanna use me for stuff.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.340]   - You mean Tim Dillon?
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:30.180]   - Tim Dillon.
[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.420]   (laughing)
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.500]   - I love that guy.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.320]   You guys met?
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.160]   - We haven't met yet here.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.420]   - You haven't met, okay, wow.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.660]   - We met before in New York,
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.020]   but we had not since I moved here.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.740]   - Yeah, so you should be able to detect
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:45.980]   that there's those people,
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.100]   and there's the people that have kindness in their heart,
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.180]   even if they can benefit from the interaction with you,
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.260]   but they're good human beings.
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.140]   I feel like you run into a lot of trouble
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.940]   if you surround yourself or have any people
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.860]   that are manipulative like that.
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.980]   - But I think you make a bad example,
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.180]   'cause let's look at Clinton,
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.060]   and let's look at Obama, right?
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.860]   So Obama, even though their politics are very close,
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.100]   I'd say in many ways,
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.860]   Obama is apparent, we don't know,
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.940]   I don't know either of them,
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.700]   but to me it seems very apparent
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.740]   that he's very similar behind closed doors
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.580]   as he is in front of the camera.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.980]   - Yeah, yeah, he's Barack to me.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:19.820]   - Oh, okay.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:20.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:21.480]   - He's good.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.460]   - Yeah.
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:27.220]   Clinton seems very clearly to be much more of a performer.
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.980]   He's in front of the cameras, he puts on a role,
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.300]   but behind the cameras he very much has a temper.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.260]   He's known for that.
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.720]   He's much more of a lech.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:35.660]   What's that?
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.660]   - A pervert.
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.300]   - Oh, lech with an E?
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.500]   - L-E-T-C-H, yeah.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.380]   - Oh, cool.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.460]   Lech, is that like a, that's a cool term,
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.580]   so I can use that on the internet?
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.780]   Like you're a lech.
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:46.940]   - Yeah, you can use it on the internet.
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.180]   - You're a dirty lech.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.180]   - Well, dirty's implied.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.140]   - Oh, so it's, okay.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.140]   - Yeah, so--
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.060]   - Being redundant.
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.260]   - Yeah.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.140]   - But it just feels like he needs an adjective
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.420]   to give it more power.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.740]   Anyway, I'm sorry, so Clinton is a lech.
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:03.740]   - Right, so you can see how there's people
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:07.100]   who wanna meet the surface Bill Clinton,
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.340]   and I'm sure that gets old for him
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.900]   'cause he has to be on,
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.460]   but then there's the good old boys
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.180]   where he could be a pervert,
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.540]   and this guy's like, yeah, I know what it's like,
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.100]   and then he feels like he's himself,
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.820]   but we're all speculating.
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.060]   I mean, I don't know what Bill Clinton is like,
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.140]   what was in it for him.
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.580]   He certainly could afford private jets if he wanted to.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.440]   There's no shortage of people who wanna fly around the world
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.580]   to give speeches, you know.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.780]   - Can't he satisfy the lech within?
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.980]   Without hanging out with the Jeffrey Epsteins of the world?
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.180]   Like, can't he get, I mean,
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.220]   this is the Monica Lewinsky question to me.
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.420]   I'm confused by all of this.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:46.340]   Can't he get women in an illegitimate way
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.540]   of not using his power,
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:53.220]   not hanging out with these shady, rich people,
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.780]   but just having a normal mistress like JFK had?
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.140]   - Well, JFK had a lot.
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.380]   - I know, I understand that, but in a normal way,
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.780]   or I don't know enough about JFK.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:07.780]   - I don't understand the Clinton psychology.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.860]   First of all, the fact that you're hooking up
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.060]   with someone who's close to your daughter's age,
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.140]   to me, I think is inherently disturbing.
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:18.260]   But she's an adult, so okay, that's not that, that,
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:19.860]   you know, beyond the pale.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.300]   But also the idea that, oh,
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:26.920]   if I don't physically fornicate with you, it's not cheating.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.740]   Like that, whatever you tell yourself,
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.780]   or like if I don't ejaculate, it's not cheating.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.540]   Like these rules that--
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.580]   - Maybe it leads to some kind of slippery slope.
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.580]   Like you start not having the rules of--
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.540]   - Who you fool, I mean, if you told your wife,
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.700]   like listen, it wasn't cheating, she only, you know,
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.700]   performed on me, you're gonna say this with a straight face?
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:51.820]   Like do you, at a certain point when something is so brazen,
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.740]   you wonder if the person even has to believe it,
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.420]   because who are you fooling?
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.500]   But like we started this conversation with,
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:03.220]   there is a line between young women older than 18
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:07.620]   and young teen, like 12, 13, kids.
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.820]   - Have you ever, when's the last,
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.060]   oh, 'cause it's different for you 'cause you're at MIT.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.380]   I was hanging out with Blair White,
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.780]   and she had a couple of fans of hers,
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.700]   and they were like 22, 23,
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.580]   and they were like children to me.
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:26.380]   Like I'm like, to me, as someone who is in his late 60s,
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.300]   to look at these people as adults,
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.100]   like they look completely like kids.
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.500]   So that--
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.660]   - Now, of course, there's exceptions.
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:38.300]   Like I've interacted with young 20-year-olds
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.500]   that are like, you're way more mature than I'll ever be.
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.740]   Like the wisdom that comes out of them is quite fascinating.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:49.140]   - Visually, the energy and the way they look,
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.220]   they looked so young to me,
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.180]   and the way they carried themselves.
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:58.100]   The idea that my instinct was,
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.140]   let's tuck you in and read you a bedtime story,
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.220]   not let me touch you or something.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.260]   It was just like, it just wouldn't enter my head.
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.620]   So there's, but the thing is,
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.020]   is it possible that in order to wanna be the president,
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.140]   you have to be a crazy person?
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.820]   - That you have some kind of weird view on power.
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.820]   It could be a power thing, too.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:19.660]   - Yeah.
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.700]   - Like you can get away with stuff.
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.140]   Like if I was Clinton's age,
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.940]   nothing about Monica Lewinsky to me would be attractive.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.060]   And also, I would just feel bad for her
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.260]   'cause I know she's gonna catch feelings.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.100]   And it's kind of like--
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.300]   - Catch feelings, yeah, it's true.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.140]   This is very true.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:37.420]   - It's just like, why would I do this to this kid?
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.260]   For what?
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.700]   Just 'cause I wanna get some momentary pleasure?
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.540]   Come on.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.420]   - Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.740]   I'm sure she looked gorgeous to him in the moment.
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:51.620]   Well, let me ask, we started talking about beauty.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:52.700]   Who are you wearing?
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:56.180]   (laughing)
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:00.740]   So as a model, you usually don't have a shirt on
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.840]   when you're modeling.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.360]   So it's nice to see you dressed up today.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:10.180]   Nice and warm.
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.860]   - This is because, so for those who don't know,
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.420]   Russians don't celebrate Christmas.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.700]   Obviously, with the Soviet Union, Christmas was illegal.
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:21.260]   - No Thanksgiving, basically no major holidays
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:22.380]   where everyone gets together.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.860]   This is the one holiday, New Year's.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.300]   - Yeah, New Year's, Novigrad.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.220]   And instead of, I remember as a kid,
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.420]   instead of Santa Claus, we have Ded Moroz,
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.220]   who's the same thing, basically.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.900]   - It's like Android and iPhone.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.940]   It's like a cheap version of Christmas.
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.080]   - He's got this girl with him.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.540]   She's like Snow White or whatever.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.820]   And Russian kids, they go to sleep on December 31st,
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.940]   and they wake up January,
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.700]   and they have a present under their pillow.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.420]   And I remember as a kid, this happened once,
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.740]   and it just blew my mind.
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:48.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.100]   It's just like, I went to bed,
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.140]   and my dad's like, "Oh, you know, you're gonna have,
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.380]   "Ded Moroz is gonna bring you a present
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.420]   "if you've been a good kid."
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.780]   I'm like, "I think I was a good kid."
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.340]   But you don't even remember a year of your life
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.740]   when you're four.
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:01.420]   You remember like two weeks. - You remember those moments.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.700]   - Yeah, and then I woke up,
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.180]   and there was a present under my pillow,
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.060]   and it just blew my mind.
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.220]   That building is still there,
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.420]   1461 Sherwood Parkway in Brooklyn.
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:15.460]   And it's just also funny.
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.660]   What I really like about kids,
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.960]   being an uncle now, is kid logic.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.260]   Because they have very little data,
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.740]   but they're using logic to make sense of it.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.620]   And sometimes it gives them the completely wrong conclusions
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.500]   for the completely right reasons.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:35.500]   I remember, my bedroom as a kid was right off the kitchen,
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.540]   and I'd be scared of the dark a little bit,
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:38.980]   so they'd leave the light on the kitchen
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.460]   while I went to sleep.
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.740]   And at the same time, my parents had told me,
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.040]   "You don't leave the lights on the house.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.380]   "It costs money, wastes electricity."
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.820]   So I would be worried, 'cause I'm like,
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.280]   "Oh my God, my parents leave the lights
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.740]   "on the kitchen all night,
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.560]   "and now it's costing them so much money."
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.660]   Not realizing that five minutes after I'm out,
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:58.880]   obviously they're turning the lights off.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.160]   But in my kid logic, this was a concern of mine.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.880]   - Yeah, and memories work that same way.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.680]   I have a collection of memories
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.940]   that are stitched together logically somehow,
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.920]   but they also don't really make sense.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.720]   There's a few defining things.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.640]   So I grew up in Russia,
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.460]   and experienced a lot of New Years in Russia.
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:22.960]   There's a lot of incredible things about that tradition
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.520]   that just warms my heart.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.320]   So one, as a kid, you mentioned these kind of stories,
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.680]   that's the one night of the year
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.400]   that kids are allowed to be adults in the following way,
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.520]   like in kid logic.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.920]   You're allowed to stay up all night.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.920]   - Oh yeah, okay.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.120]   - That was as late as you want,
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.960]   which actually ends up being, you're not used to it.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.960]   - 11, right, you're out.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:50.460]   - You crash, but no, you get to two, three, four at night,
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.460]   you stay up, and what you get to witness
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.620]   is almost like "Alice in Wonderland" goes into this world.
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.860]   You get to witness what is the adult world really like.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.220]   Now, obviously it's not an actual adult world.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.820]   - A lot of drinking and fighting.
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:08.140]   - Merriment, like laughing, fighting, arguing,
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:11.620]   but also, in our case, like singing,
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:16.180]   and arguing, like philosophical stuff,
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:20.980]   but also, if I may, how would I describe it?
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.320]   This is also probably a little bit of Russian culture,
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.500]   but flirtation in all of its forms,
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.200]   meaning men and women just being like,
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.580]   'cause they dress up.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:36.580]   It's joy, it's like you get to show off dresses,
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.700]   whatever you got, you show it off, this is fun.
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:44.700]   And then men, too, just like friends, laughing,
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.260]   arguing, just showing off the best they got
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.180]   with delicious food.
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.100]   Obviously, there's a Thanksgiving element there,
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.220]   where there's just so many,
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.280]   you bring out all the traditional stuff.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.860]   You have salad, just everything,
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.020]   just the full thing with the desserts,
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.740]   and obviously the vodka, a lot of vodka.
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:08.700]   And at the time, so this is the Soviet Union,
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.940]   the biggest stuff, and this is so sad
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.420]   that these are the things I remember,
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.060]   is Coca-Cola.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:16.900]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:20.980]   - Like American, I would probably kill somebody
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:22.620]   for a Dr. Pepper.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:26.700]   It's so fascinating that you take it for granted,
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:30.140]   sort of the results of capitalist society,
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.980]   the material things that are created,
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.860]   but that was the ultimate happiness,
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:41.860]   is to experience this new thing, sugar, I don't know.
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:43.380]   Under scarcity, you just love it.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:46.740]   - There's like communist Coca-Cola in Czech Republic.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.540]   So basically, they tried to rip off Coke,
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.380]   and it's just like,
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.460]   they just threw whatever they could together,
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.260]   and it was a very poor knockoff, as you can imagine.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.140]   I forget what it's called,
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.220]   and all the Czech people right now
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.580]   are getting very angry at me 'cause I can't think of it.
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:04.700]   But they have it now, and the slogan is, "Good or weird?"
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.060]   So it's like this,
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.860]   so they kind of reclaimed this kind of hipster soda, yeah.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:10.700]   - Oh, that's awesome.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.740]   It's almost like a parody.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.580]   - Right, yeah.
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:17.340]   - But I think the thing I really remember is the camaraderie,
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:22.620]   like the love for each other, and neighbors too.
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:26.500]   Like you and I are neighbors now.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.740]   We don't see each other that often.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.820]   I hope that changes, but a lot of it is also me.
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.140]   I'm just a deep introvert.
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.220]   - You're also the hardest working person I know.
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.220]   - Yeah, so it's time, but you know,
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:41.340]   it's not like I'll go in the middle of the night
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.300]   at like 4 a.m. and go to 7-Eleven,
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.900]   just sit there sipping a Slurpee for an hour
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:49.060]   thinking about life.
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.540]   So it's not like I'm always working.
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.380]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.980]   What I mean is you get to meet your neighbors,
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:58.940]   and you get to experience their highs and their lows,
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:01.940]   and you get to bitch about life, about government,
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.620]   about corruption, about the unfairness of life together.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.660]   - Well, it's also, I think,
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.660]   what people don't appreciate as Americans
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.900]   is it's very rare in Russia to have a safe space.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.740]   - Yeah.
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:16.220]   - So you know that January 1st,
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:18.140]   no one's gonna snitch on you.
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.220]   They're not gonna be informants probably,
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:23.420]   so you can vent, and that's the thing
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.740]   with people in totalitarian countries.
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.740]   You have to have the public-facing persona,
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:29.700]   and then behind closed doors, it's very different.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.540]   - It all comes out.
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.060]   I also remember the arguments,
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:36.140]   and I've been going on Clubhouse recently
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.420]   into Russian rooms.
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:38.660]   - Oh, Jesus.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.500]   - Well, just to practice Russian,
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.040]   and it's so beautiful to watch.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.900]   I mean, Clubhouse is a very specific collection
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:48.140]   of Russian people.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.900]   Maybe it's a little bit political,
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.500]   and they're a little bit older,
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:57.900]   and it's interesting to watch how much they love to argue.
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.860]   - Oh, Russian love to argue. - They love.
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.040]   And so it would be literally,
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:06.300]   you could think of it as a nonlinear dynamical system,
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.200]   okay, from an engineering perspective.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:12.720]   Whenever any positive topic comes up,
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:16.220]   you could feel the skepticism, and then wait a minute,
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:20.660]   this is not good, and they'll start perturbing it
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:24.540]   until you're like, they'll find some way to say,
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.460]   like, come on now, that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard,
[00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.020]   and then it goes back into argument.
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:32.420]   It's so fun to watch, because in one sense,
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.360]   you could see it as negative.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.740]   In another, you could see it as free to express yourself,
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.960]   because it feels like you can solve a lot of problems
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.580]   by allowing yourself to just be emotional,
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:48.100]   both emotional and say hard truths
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.500]   and all those kinds of things
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:54.540]   without patting yourself on the back about it,
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:58.900]   but also, it just, sort of those Russian rooms,
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:02.100]   make me realize how constrained American speech is,
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.780]   how careful people are in the way they express it,
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.580]   even the Michael Malis is in the world.
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:09.300]   You're constantly being nuanced.
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:13.460]   There, they just say crazy shit,
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.060]   and then they correct themselves and make fun of themselves,
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:19.020]   and they completely shift opinions a minute later,
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.620]   and it's chaos.
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:21.460]   - Yeah.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.300]   - I mean, it's beautiful chaos.
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.060]   So I love that that culture is present.
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:28.660]   It's funny, given the current regime in Russia,
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:32.020]   like how that's coupled with how people are talking,
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.260]   and yeah, I don't know,
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.540]   and I have those memories of childhood,
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:38.980]   of friends that I had,
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.500]   of just having that true freedom of talking,
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:45.420]   and somehow that leads to deep bonds together.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.000]   When the life, when you're poor,
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.160]   when life has a lot of elements that are unfair,
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.460]   when the government is corrupt,
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.500]   there's sort of, it's just,
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:56.900]   especially in the Soviet Union,
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.440]   there's uncertainty about the future,
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.580]   all of it, you just get closer together,
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.220]   like penguins huddling together in the cold,
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.420]   like that March of the Penguins movie,
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.580]   that, I don't know, the friends I've gotten there,
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:16.660]   I get emotional every time I kinda think about those friends
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:18.000]   'cause it was so close.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.660]   That friendship was so fucking close.
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:22.780]   - But I just really hate the Russian cynicism.
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:23.620]   - No, I know you do,
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.700]   and I actually disagree with you about it.
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:27.860]   You see it as cynicism.
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.900]   I see it as waves on top of the water,
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:32.820]   like surface cynicism,
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.020]   and the depths, I see the beauty of the Russian soul.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.300]   So we, like, yes,
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:41.140]   that cynicism can negatively affect a lot of people.
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.640]   I think you've talked about, like, as a parent,
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:47.300]   being cynical about the world,
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.060]   and then you have dire negative consequences
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.920]   on your children, they become cynical,
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.300]   they don't ever take big risks,
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.940]   they take on bold things,
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.060]   and I have those arguments
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:59.780]   because the cynicism is exhausting, it's destructive,
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.580]   it's anti-creative,
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:04.620]   but, so in their perspective,
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.220]   as this is what the Russian folks would say,
[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.700]   well, yes, that's our role.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:12.700]   Like, being cynical is being reasonable about the world.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:14.540]   - But it's not, it's completely unreasonable.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:15.980]   It's a complete lie.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.140]   - No, I know, but their argument is,
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:21.220]   yes, but we're giving you this force,
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.660]   and it's your job to resist against it.
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:25.060]   So it's a test.
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:28.260]   - I love the idea that if you're gonna be creative
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.300]   and innovative, you don't have enough up against you.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.180]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.620]   This is exactly it.
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.780]   - It's not hard enough already that I wanna be an author,
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:35.620]   and now you gotta be like,
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:38.740]   well, let me just put some fire ants on top of it.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:41.080]   - So I just wanna separate,
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:45.580]   I agree with you that the cynicism is bad and destructive,
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:49.160]   but the idea that life is suffering,
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:53.300]   and thinking from that as a first principle,
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:54.860]   I think there's a lot of beauty
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.300]   to be discovered through that.
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:01.300]   So there's a cynicism, and then there's a horrible message.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.980]   - Life is suffering?
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:06.740]   - No, not, well, yeah, I mean, Camus.
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.180]   - Camus doesn't think that.
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:14.700]   - Now we're going into definitions of suffering then,
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.260]   because absurd.
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:19.120]   - Life is absurd and life is suffering
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.020]   are not even close to the same concept.
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:23.060]   - Well, then you're just defining the terms differently.
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:25.020]   - Well, that's 'cause they're different terms.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.820]   - Well, so is love and beauty,
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.340]   but so let's define, okay.
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.260]   - Wait, you're telling if your baby's in the crib,
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:32.140]   like with a fever, you're like, oh, that's absurd.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.580]   No, it's the kid's suffering.
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:34.700]   It's not the same.
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.500]   - So yes, starvation, see,
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.300]   you've been, for the white pill researching,
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.380]   a lot of actual specifically defined suffering.
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:45.380]   - Sure, but also a lot of wonderful things.
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.500]   - Right, yeah, yeah.
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:49.420]   But the word suffering can encompass
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:52.060]   more than just specifically starving,
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:55.500]   and it can encompass,
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.340]   like a lot of the philosophers talk about it,
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:00.100]   it encompass like philosophical suffering,
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:01.460]   the fact that there is,
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:05.720]   if you're not careful, life can appear meaningless.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.620]   You can fall into a nihilistic view.
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:11.500]   Like it's difficult to have the responsibility
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.640]   of freedom to act in this world,
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.900]   because you can fuck up in so many different ways.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:19.900]   And then life is seemingly unfair
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:23.740]   in the sense that good things happen
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:25.460]   for no apparent reason,
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.980]   and terrible things happen for no apparent,
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:30.220]   like it's the old religious question
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:33.060]   of why does evil happen in the world,
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:35.220]   or why do terrible things happen in the world?
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.300]   - There's this book called Six Word Memoirs,
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.540]   right, where all these different personalities--
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:40.380]   - Those are awesome.
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:41.200]   - Were you in it?
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.040]   - No.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:42.880]   - I'm in it with,
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.660]   so you had to basically write your autobiography
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:45.500]   in six words.
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:46.320]   - In six words.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.260]   - And mine was, good things happen to bad people.
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:50.020]   (laughing)
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:51.540]   - You see, there you go, there's humor.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:52.380]   - Yes.
[00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:53.420]   - That's your way of dealing with the suffering.
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.700]   - But I don't think life is inherently,
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:58.540]   if life was suffering, we wouldn't be able to have happiness.
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.500]   - No, out of suffering, happiness is born.
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.940]   So like it's the ups and downs of life.
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:05.420]   And what it means like--
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:08.980]   - I don't, I disagree, I don't agree at all
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:11.620]   that you need to suffer in order to be happy.
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:13.300]   I agree you have to work hard,
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.180]   but that's not the same thing.
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:17.260]   - Yeah, all right, so the way I'm using suffering,
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.620]   I think a lot of them use suffering
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:21.260]   is the way you use like gravity.
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:23.100]   So in order for the roller coaster to work,
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.620]   you need gravity.
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:27.020]   There needs to be a force that bring you down.
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:27.860]   - Sure.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.460]   - In that same way, there's like,
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:35.180]   you have to resist the natural pull of nature
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:38.180]   that wants to destroy you.
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:43.180]   - No, nature wants you to, nature's indifferent,
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:47.500]   but we have the capacity 'cause we're blessed with minds
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:48.900]   and we're blessed with friends.
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:50.780]   - Yeah, to transcend nature.
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:54.100]   Yeah, no, I know, but I think it's a word
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.660]   that captures something about life
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:57:01.340]   that there's no reason to it, that is absurd.
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.260]   I think to me, oftentimes,
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.820]   the way I think about the word suffering
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:07.980]   is synonymous with absurdity.
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:12.420]   - This is not suffering, but this is absurd.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.420]   I just noticed there's a box
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:17.060]   with a big bow on it next to you.
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:18.540]   What's in the box, Michael?
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:21.700]   - It's your present, so it's your present for New Year's.
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.540]   - Can we open it?
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:23.380]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:26.420]   - What's in the box?
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:27.260]   - It's gonna take--
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.180]   - And you brought up suffering.
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:29.460]   This is gonna be very unpleasant.
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:30.300]   - Here you go.
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.900]   I packed it myself.
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:35.820]   Yeah, there's a whole process in there.
[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:38.860]   So there's three presents in there.
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:41.820]   - Less.
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:43.820]   - I'll read the card first.
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:44.660]   - Okay.
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:53.420]   - Something about opening presents, like tearing stuff,
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:54.700]   makes me feel like,
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.700]   'cause I just tore the sheet of paper,
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:59.380]   so it'll never be the same again.
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:00.300]   - It's entropy.
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.140]   - It's entropy.
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.980]   Times, you've got a powerful voice.
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:08.180]   You've got a powerful voice.
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.580]   To Lex, thank you.
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:14.780]   Maybe I should read the other card first.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:15.980]   You've got a powerful voice.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:17.540]   Listening to what you have to say
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:19.580]   always puts me in a hopeful place.
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:21.900]   I feel like this is building up to something.
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:24.300]   You show me how change can happen
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.740]   when you face the world with pride, confidence,
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.940]   and a voice that can't be silenced.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:30.380]   Keep speaking up.
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:31.820]   The world is listening.
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:32.660]   - Yeah.
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:35.180]   - There's no cynicism in this card.
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.900]   - No, this is New Year's.
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.500]   This is all about hope and joy.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:39.340]   (laughing)
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.180]   What?
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:41.580]   - To Lex, I'm seeing the binary.
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:44.340]   To Lex, thank you for setting the path
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:46.820]   for me to move to Austin.
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:49.140]   Zero one, zero zero one.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:53.420]   Zero zero one, zero one one, zero one one,
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:57.420]   zero zero zero one one, one zero one zero one.
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:58.260]   Michael Mells.
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:59.100]   - Yeah.
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:02.540]   - Brings tears to my eyes.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.380]   Thank you, brother.
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:04.220]   - My pleasure.
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:08.140]   - Let's get to the present.
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:09.580]   (laughing)
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:10.420]   - Okay.
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.860]   - It's a PC box.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.100]   This is very promising.
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.900]   It better not be sex toys.
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:18.980]   - There's nothing, this is all,
[00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:21.380]   there's nothing inappropriate at all.
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:22.460]   Why would it?
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.580]   - Why would sex toys be inappropriate?
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:25.420]   - Because you're--
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:26.260]   - That's sex positive.
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:27.380]   - Because you're a virgin.
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:32.260]   - You gotta bring a knife to a party.
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:38.420]   - How clever is it to put it in a PC box?
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:40.300]   - Well, I had it, I just got a new PC.
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:43.380]   Okay, there's also a can.
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:44.220]   - Yeah.
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:45.180]   - Open the can first.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:46.020]   - Open the can.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:51.580]   Do you wrap this yourself?
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:53.820]   (laughing)
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:57.740]   That scared the shit out of me.
[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.980]   (laughing)
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:07.020]   Could get back in the can.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.500]   - That actually stayed in there.
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.460]   That's magic.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:10.860]   - Just gotta cut the string.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:13.940]   - No.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.180]   (laughing)
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:22.500]   You're the most beautiful troll of all.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.340]   - I am.
[01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:24.180]   - I love you so much.
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:31.540]   This is awesome.
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.540]   (plastic crinkling)
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:39.660]   - Did it not work?
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.500]   Pick it up.
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:43.660]   Oh, it didn't work.
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:51.980]   - There's a terrifying springy feeling to this thing.
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.100]   I don't wanna open this.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.820]   - I need to move something aside.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.540]   (plastic crinkling)
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:05.020]   I hate you so much.
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:05.860]   - What?
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:06.700]   - What?
[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:10.220]   Oh, is it the other way?
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.340]   - No, just pick it up.
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:20.820]   (laughing)
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:23.820]   (plastic crinkling)
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:31.340]   - I can't believe I fell for that.
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:32.220]   Thank you so much.
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:35.660]   Wrenches are my favorite.
[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.660]   I can't believe I fell for that.
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.020]   - Okay.
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.500]   - And there's box number three.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.100]   - It's like a matryoshka.
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.220]   - I can't believe that worked.
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.060]   - Yeah.
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:48.460]   I wanted the box to open all these gears to fall out,
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.300]   but you can't get any.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.620]   - You can't get them, yeah.
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.460]   - Does that really grind your...
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.580]   - You know what grinding is?
[01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:58.740]   - Why am I scared?
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.940]   Okay.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:09.460]   There's another box.
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:15.500]   This leads to my death.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.180]   - No, no, there's a story behind it.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.260]   (laughing)
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:22.980]   - I can't believe that worked.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.340]   Oh God, that's so good.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.180]   All right.
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:29.700]   - All right, no springs, no weapons.
[01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:30.540]   - No wrenches.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:40.940]   Okay, so let me tell you the story behind that toy.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:46.340]   - Tonka robots that turn into vehicles.
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:49.140]   - So when I was a kid,
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.380]   you had Transformers,
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.460]   but for us poor people,
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.580]   you had GoBots, right?
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:56.860]   So the GoBots,
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:58.780]   they were four main characters for the good guys.
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.460]   It was Leader One, Smallfoot Turbo, and Scooter.
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:06.060]   And what was annoying is when you had the action figures,
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:09.180]   you couldn't find the ones that were on the TV show.
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.620]   And I was a big GoBots fan as a kid.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.740]   And I went once to the Toys R Us
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:16.380]   in Caesars Bay in Brooklyn with my grandfather.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.900]   My grandfather was always very lucky,
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.700]   like just good things happened to him every so often.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.900]   And I went there, I remember very vividly,
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.620]   they must've just unpacked,
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:26.140]   they just loaded the shelves.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.340]   And how they had the shelving,
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:28.580]   it would be like a grid.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:31.420]   You'd have like, it was like one, two, three, four, five,
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:35.220]   five rows and like five by five.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.940]   And I remember it was like two up.
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.020]   And then you have to do,
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.940]   you have to sit by the side and kind of sort through them.
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:41.780]   And with the GoBots,
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.780]   each package had a picture of the different figures.
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:45.460]   So the packaging wasn't uniform.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.220]   And they just had Scooter there.
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.260]   She was just sitting there.
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:49.580]   And I was like, holy crap.
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:53.980]   So that feeling when you're a kid
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.660]   and you find that just sitting on the shelf--
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:57.500]   - Scooter's right there.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.340]   - It's just, it was such this--
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.900]   - Wait, is this that Scooter?
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.100]   - No, I have it though.
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.500]   But that one is for you.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.740]   I thought if you want to put it next to your other robots--
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.780]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Open it up.
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.460]   - I can open it up? - Yeah, yeah, it's for you.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.820]   And that way, it's that symbol of joy
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:11.820]   when you have when you're a kid,
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.700]   when you find something you really want.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.500]   I think it just is really like,
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.540]   so when people look at it, they'll be like,
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:18.940]   don't be hopeless.
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:20.500]   - I'll open this carefully later.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.340]   - No, do it, just do it.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.380]   - Yeah, should I do it now? - Yeah.
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.220]   - Okay.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.220]   - There's no way to open it carefully.
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.380]   Kids don't open stuff carefully.
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:27.900]   You rip that crap open.
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:29.700]   - But then you break it and then you cry.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.300]   That's what happens when you're a kid.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.220]   - I never did that.
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.660]   - Okay.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.420]   Me neither, I never cried.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:36.940]   I never got presents either.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:41.060]   - That is so cool.
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.140]   - All right, Scooter.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.820]   - You symbolize childlike discovery.
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:48.660]   - Right?
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:54.740]   - The poor man's robot.
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:57.100]   - The poor man's transformers.
[01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:00.260]   I think there's instructions on the back
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.380]   how to transform her.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.180]   - To her?
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.140]   - I only found out as an adult
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.260]   that it was supposed to be a girl, yeah.
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.660]   - Wow, this changes everything.
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:10.340]   (laughing)
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:11.260]   Thank you, Mark.
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:12.580]   That's incredible.
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:13.540]   - No, give me, here, let me show you.
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.500]   It looks better when she's transformed.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.780]   What?
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.980]   - No, there's levels to that statement.
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:20.820]   - Oh.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.100]   - How does it do like this?
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:24.180]   Let me see if I remember how to do it.
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:26.180]   'Cause I had this as a kid.
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.100]   - Arms out.
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:32.540]   - The thing is, these are easy to break, I remember.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:33.780]   Is it like this?
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:38.020]   - No, oh, the front comes out.
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.980]   - Oh, let me see this.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.980]   Oh, this comes up, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.380]   - Yep, so that's that.
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:45.700]   The arms go.
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.900]   - I'm having visions of like baby Michael.
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.780]   - I can't do it.
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:51.980]   Okay, I can't do it.
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:52.940]   I can't figure it out.
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:54.020]   - Wow, you're right.
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.860]   She looks so much better transformed.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:57.700]   Oh.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.500]   All right.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.500]   I'm gonna follow the instructions in a bit.
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:06.260]   - I'll leave this failed project of yours.
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:09.500]   Oh, there's a wheel out.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:12.060]   - Well, I don't like this in between form.
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:15.820]   - Well, this is how it's gonna be.
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:17.340]   - Okay.
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.380]   - Because we're gonna be accepting of the transformation.
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.620]   That takes time.
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:22.980]   - Okay.
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:27.420]   - I got, I saw this.
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:30.100]   - Oh, it's this.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.980]   - Little thing when I was walking on Congress
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.540]   and it says resist.
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.380]   It's a bracelet.
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.340]   It made me think of you.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:38.500]   The reason I got it is 'cause there's two bracelets.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:43.500]   So one said lucky fuck and the other one said resist.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.740]   Now I first saw resist and I'm like,
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:47.220]   and then I saw the lucky fuck
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:51.060]   and I realized I'm a lucky fuck to find a relevant.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.980]   It makes me think of you.
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:54.940]   - This is very nice.
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:56.700]   - Resist the powerful.
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.540]   - That's true.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:00.980]   I saw this somewhere.
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:03.380]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:09.500]   This has to do with, in terms of resist,
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:13.740]   you often bring up the book Machiavellians by James Burnham.
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:17.540]   And so I was looking through,
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.020]   I was reading different parts of it.
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:20.460]   It's a tricky read.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:24.620]   It's a little bit, but there is a ebook,
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:27.660]   Kindle version now that I've been working through.
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.660]   I think there's an actual audio book too, anyway.
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.140]   - Yeah, I just bought some.
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:34.300]   The Machiavellians is James Burnham's analysis
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:38.100]   of the four thinkers that he regards as the Machiavellians.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:42.020]   It was Gaetano Mosco, Vilfredo Pareto, George Sorrell,
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:47.020]   and I'm blanking on the Mosco, Pareto, Sorrell,
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:49.860]   and George Michel.
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.940]   And I just got Pareto's autograph in the mail this week.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:58.500]   - So he talks about freedom and liberty.
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:02.500]   This is an interesting line
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.300]   that I'd like to get your opinion on
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.500]   in terms of resist and in terms of liberty.
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.100]   There's no one force, it goes, quote,
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:11.620]   there's no one force, no group, and no class
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.780]   that is the preserver of liberty.
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.540]   Liberty is preserved by those
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:18.280]   who are against the existing chief power.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:23.100]   Oppositions which do not express genuine social forces
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:26.220]   are as trivial in relation to entrenched power
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.860]   as the old court jesters.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:31.140]   So, I mean, the question here is,
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:36.140]   can liberty, are you comfortable with that definition
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:39.700]   or that view of liberty, of freedom,
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:42.660]   that at its highest ideal is expressed
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.660]   through the resistance to the powerful
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:46.300]   as opposed to existing in its own?
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:50.740]   - I think his point, broadly speaking, which I agree with,
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:53.460]   is the only thing that can work
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:56.780]   to mitigate power is other power.
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:01.820]   That it's, talk is cheap
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:05.660]   and persuasion has very limited efficacy.
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:08.740]   It's like if there's a burglar, right,
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:11.740]   and one person will give you a speech about property rights
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.500]   and you shouldn't be in this person's house
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.980]   and the other person has a gun, you know,
[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:18.920]   it's clear which is gonna be more persuasive.
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:22.300]   - Yeah, but can't you just be free
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:25.740]   without the struggle, without this conflict?
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:29.020]   I mean, what I'm uncomfortable with this view
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:34.020]   is how closely it links freedom and conflict.
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:38.500]   Like, why does this world have to have conflict
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:39.620]   for you to be free?
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:42.660]   Can't, I mean, and part of it is just emphasis.
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:43.820]   - Well, you weren't just saying suffering
[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:44.860]   is what leads to joy?
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:48.020]   - See, and now you're in agreement.
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.620]   Thank you, I just did that
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.420]   just so you can come around and agree.
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.100]   I win, next topic.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.340]   (laughing)
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:59.980]   Wow, I'm playing 3D chess here.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:04.920]   Okay, this is New Year's.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.140]   This is now December 31st.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.660]   I think that's how it works, but in 1973.
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:11.660]   - Okay.
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:13.660]   - We recorded this before you were born.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:17.100]   Oh no, years after you were born, 60.
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:22.100]   You look great for 60, early 60s or?
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.180]   - Sure. - Okay.
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:29.180]   What five things, let's say, or moments in 2021
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:31.180]   are you grateful for?
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:35.380]   Or people, just, I don't know, things, moments,
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:40.380]   beautiful experiences, profound essences of the year.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:43.780]   Like looking back, what are the cool things?
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.220]   - Personally or socially?
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:49.580]   - Do you exist like in a platonic way socially?
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.860]   I mean, oh, in your personal life?
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:52.780]   - Yeah. - Anything.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:56.660]   You're both, you're now Michael Malice.
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:00.500]   You exist as a social entity and a personal human being
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.180]   and all of it, the whole thing.
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:05.220]   Like what stands out to you about 2021?
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:07.740]   - The fact that for the first time in my life,
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:10.380]   other than college, I moved to a new city.
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.300]   That was a very big one and there's no part of me
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:15.420]   that regrets it or misses New York.
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.940]   So that was a very big deal for me.
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:22.300]   - What do you, about this move, about Austin itself,
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:27.300]   but maybe the move itself, maybe just the act of moving,
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:31.220]   what's great about it to you?
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:34.860]   - The fact that I had forgotten what it's like
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:38.420]   to have a huge social network, which I had in New York,
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.300]   before people started falling away
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:43.460]   and then it really escalated as a result of de Blasio
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.100]   and the COVID restrictions.
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:48.380]   So to have a big crew here is something
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:50.460]   that was very validating.
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:53.780]   The thing that's also exciting about Austin
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:56.340]   is that Austin is not a particularly big town.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.900]   It's not a particularly great town,
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:00.780]   but everyone here, at least in the circles I travel in,
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:03.540]   is kind of a refugee from their towns.
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.500]   So there is this sense of camaraderie.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.100]   There is the sense of we're building something together.
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.500]   Back in New York, when you meet someone,
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.860]   it would be like, who is this person?
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.300]   Why am I talking to them?
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.300]   Like, are they a normie?
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.740]   Are they gonna be weird?
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.820]   And here there's very little of that.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.380]   I think there's much more sense of trust with one another
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:21.380]   when you meet new people.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:24.060]   So that's something that's really exciting about,
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.980]   like I've been introducing all my friends to each other
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.180]   and everyone's been hitting it off like gangbusters.
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.300]   It's really great.
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:32.220]   So I really enjoy that about Austin.
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:35.940]   I'm enjoying the weather, the space.
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.140]   - You read Kerouac, any of his stuff?
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.380]   - I have, on the road, I read a biography of him.
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.820]   - I don't know if it was on, I think it was on the road
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:46.780]   where he talks about that feeling
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:50.820]   when you go into some place, you're leaving a place
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:52.820]   and you go in somewhere else
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:56.260]   and the place you're leaving disappears behind you
[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:58.140]   and all the people and all,
[01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:01.300]   like you just think about that life and it's forever gone.
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.980]   And there's some inkling of that
[01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.900]   where you get to realize your almost mortality
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:12.660]   because, okay, that's a chapter and there's not many more.
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.580]   I know it's a beautiful chapter,
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:16.420]   but now on to the next chapter.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:18.260]   Is there a melancholy feeling there?
[01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.100]   - No, it's the opposite.
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.380]   I feel like I've been given a new lease on life
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.660]   'cause I didn't realize to what extent
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:25.300]   there was this subtext of hopelessness in New York
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:28.500]   and also people who in New York you don't appreciate
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.740]   or you appreciate it consciously
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.420]   but you can't escape it emotionally,
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:34.900]   how much the winters get to you psychologically.
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:37.180]   It's tough, it gets dark so early, it gets cold,
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.260]   you can't walk around.
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:39.460]   Like that's the thing that's fun about
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.140]   or what's fun about New York is that
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.780]   when the weather's warm you can walk for an hour
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:46.060]   and just enjoy the sunshine and there's a lot to see and do,
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:49.020]   but in the winter you don't have any of that, it's brutal.
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.600]   And here it's just, so that is something,
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.020]   there's no melancholy at all.
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.580]   - Well, that's because there's,
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:58.780]   can we say something beautiful about New York?
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.300]   Not the way it is now, but the way it--
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:04.300]   - I could go on for days about how great New York was.
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.500]   - What did you learn about human civilization
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:10.300]   and just life that was beautiful from New York?
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.620]   - I learned that there's a lot
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:19.260]   of really unique special people out there
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:22.340]   who are doing their little part to move the envelope
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:24.220]   and make the world a better place.
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:28.980]   And that when you have a city
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:32.220]   where they're all there together at the same time,
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:33.540]   then that really moves the world.
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.620]   And I'm thinking of Paris in the '20s
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:39.140]   and Harlem in the '20s and New York in the '70s
[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:42.300]   and LA in the late '60s and San Francisco,
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.940]   especially in late '60s, things like this.
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.720]   They really punch above Detroit, certainly, at its heyday.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.020]   They punch above their weight and just really kind of,
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:55.340]   Philadelphia in the 1700s, things really start happening
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:57.180]   and that ripples throughout the world.
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:01.940]   - You think Austin has a chance to be a Paris in some way?
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:04.940]   - Yes, 'cause again, it wasn't all of Paris,
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:06.580]   it was the left bank of Paris
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:08.020]   and Gertrude Stein and Hemingway
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.740]   and all of them in a little area.
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:12.940]   So when you read these history books, these scenes,
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:15.780]   it's like 50 people in a 10-block radius.
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:19.200]   These aren't these huge Davos conventions.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.060]   - Okay, so the move, the big move.
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.060]   What else stands out to you?
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:27.900]   Again, both personally and socially,
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.380]   like zooming in and zooming out.
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:32.620]   - I did a book with a UFC fighter
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.820]   and I was making the point,
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:36.580]   he was a nine-time world champion,
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.940]   that I would never be as good at my job as he was at his.
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:43.380]   And then when I dropped Anarchist Handbook in May
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:46.920]   and it was the top nonfiction book on Amazon
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.180]   for most of the day, I was like,
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:52.620]   oh, I'm the top nonfiction writer in America just for today.
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:54.980]   I was like, oh crap, okay, so I guess I was wrong.
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:56.540]   That was a major deal.
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.860]   I was still shocked and delighted.
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:01.100]   - By the way, congratulations.
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.140]   I'm truly happy for you, man.
[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:05.260]   I'm so proud.
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:10.260]   But it's also, I'm proud because these are people
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:15.660]   who had points of view and they didn't have it easy
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:17.780]   and they fought for what they believed in.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:22.660]   And insofar as I get to rescue them to some extent
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:24.220]   from the dustbin of history and say,
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.480]   these people really mattered
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:29.260]   and they really are worth hearing, that I love.
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:30.420]   I love stuff like that.
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:35.780]   I was talking to a friend of mine, Topher, a year ago.
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:37.980]   'Cause we're in a weird position
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.740]   with what kind of jobs we have.
[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:41.460]   So I'd be talking in my live streams
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:43.900]   about people like Kandi Darling or Wallace Thurman
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:47.280]   and these are not household names at all.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.020]   And then I'd be proud of myself
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.540]   that I'm the one who brings them
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.060]   to some sort of more prominence.
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:54.420]   And then you wanna tell yourself,
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:55.860]   well, get over yourself who you think you are,
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:59.180]   but no one else is talking about these people or very few.
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:02.500]   So to be able to kind of give them
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.780]   some kind of stature and platform that they deserve,
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:07.300]   I think is, I love being able to do that.
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.460]   - So you have a strong voice yourself
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.500]   and to sort of join them in,
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:14.800]   it's like John Lennon joining in with the Beatles.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:19.800]   It's like a chorus of very different views on anarchism.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:25.480]   It's celebrating the individuals, it's celebrating the idea
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:28.480]   and you are, I think will be remembered
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.240]   as a powerful philosophy yourself,
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:34.960]   but like you're almost taking just the humility
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.400]   of being in a room with powerful minds together
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.900]   in one book, it's cool.
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:41.200]   - Yeah, and that these people mattered
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.980]   and they had a unique perspective.
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.960]   And as I said in the introduction to the book,
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.560]   I remember I was in college and we were studying bioethics
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:52.440]   and there was like a graph in the book
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.740]   and one part says antinomianism,
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:56.000]   which was the view that,
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.880]   and one side said legalism, right?
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.240]   These two extremes, legalism is what is legal
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.560]   is defined by the government
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.180]   or what is moral is defined by the government.
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.040]   And one said antinomianism,
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.320]   which is nothing stands above moral law.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.160]   And then there was like, well, since no one believes in this,
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.360]   the answer is something to the other side.
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.240]   It's like, well, why is it on the charge of no one believe,
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.360]   if it has a name, someone believes in it.
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:20.040]   So anarchism is a word that's bandied about
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:22.120]   and in a dismissive way.
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.600]   And it's like, you don't have to like me
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.680]   or agree with what I'm saying,
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.160]   but you can't pretend that they weren't Tolstoy.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:28.080]   You're gonna tell me Tolstoy
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.480]   doesn't know what he's talking about completely.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.120]   He's in there, he was an anarchist.
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:35.400]   So it was a big accomplishment.
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:39.440]   - It was really cool to get a chance to do the audio book.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.080]   You did an incredible thing,
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:44.880]   which has got a bunch of really cool people to read,
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.920]   a lot of interesting, varied people to--
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.520]   - Yeah, so what I did for the audio book,
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.080]   which I don't like the idea
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.800]   that hard work is inherently good
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.960]   'cause sometimes being lazy is actually the right choice.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:56.840]   So I'm like, wait a minute,
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:59.100]   why am I reading all 23 chapters
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.480]   when it's 23 different authors?
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.520]   Does it make sense?
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.680]   So I hit my Rolodex
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:05.400]   and I had different people read different chapters
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.560]   to make it sound literally
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:10.720]   like you have the different voices in the book.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:12.240]   Thank you very much for you did my,
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:13.320]   'cause I was gonna read my chapter,
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.640]   wait a minute, like all the other authors
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.580]   are being read by somebody else.
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.120]   Let's have Lex read mine.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.400]   The one chapter I am most moved by
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.760]   is Lauren Chen, she's a podcaster as well.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.000]   She's expecting now,
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.600]   so we wish nothing but the best for Lauren and Liam
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.000]   and the Babby.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.400]   There's a chapter there
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.800]   by this guy named Charles Robert Plunkett called "Dynamite"
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:39.120]   and he's advocating for making bombs and killing people,
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.960]   killing the forces of capitalism.
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.700]   And Emma Goldman was publishing her essay
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:46.640]   while she was in lecture tour
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.520]   and she was just like, why is this in here?
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.200]   This is just really gonna make us look bad,
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.800]   so on and so forth.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.560]   And when you're dealing with any kind of,
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.720]   you know, HL Mencken has that quote about
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:00.440]   every rational man must at times be tempted
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.580]   to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:05.400]   and begin slitting throats.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.520]   So I wanted to talk,
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.760]   sound like the seductive aspect of violence.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.740]   Like that's the problem,
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:13.960]   like when you're dealing with terrorism,
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:16.220]   when you're dealing with political violence,
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:19.920]   to be able to understand how people can fall for this,
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:24.120]   how people can be persuaded to think this is a good idea,
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.720]   that I'm gonna make some dynamite
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:29.480]   and throw it into this crowd and kill police officers
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:32.040]   and innocent people possibly in service of,
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.040]   you have to, it's easy to say, oh, they're all crazy,
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.400]   but they're not, you know,
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.520]   even most people who are crazy don't do these things.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.840]   So to have a woman read that chapter
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.240]   and I told her kind of read it like a phone sex operator
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.700]   because I wanted to have that siren song
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:52.960]   of like, so you can understand why this calls out
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.320]   to people who are in the rope,
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.280]   the people who are like marginalized.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:59.200]   And she did such a superb job with that chapter.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:02.000]   - That's such a beautiful vision.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.320]   Yeah, 'cause violence,
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:06.200]   that's a violence part of human history
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:11.240]   to a degree that it must be seductive.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.280]   It must be, there must be a strong pull.
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:15.980]   Like it's not insane people.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.900]   There's something probably deep within our nature
[01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.060]   that craves violence.
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:23.820]   And then when there is charismatic leaders
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:28.820]   that inspire that and revolution plus violence,
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:33.580]   that I could see that being extremely seductive to us.
[01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:36.900]   Like when you're truly suffering in your current situation,
[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:38.660]   whatever it is, you're being oppressed by governments
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:40.860]   or being oppressed by the powerful,
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:45.860]   violent revolution is probably there's something
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:47.600]   deep within us that longs for that.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.400]   - And also this kind of the Jelaine Maxwell
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.680]   to Jeffrey Epstein, right?
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:54.840]   You need that woman to be like, no, no, this is okay, honey.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.800]   Come along, it's not a big deal.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.420]   Don't listen to what your parents told you.
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:21:59.760]   They're just prudes.
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.240]   It's a siren song.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.360]   - What do you think about Jelaine Maxwell
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.240]   and the trial and so on?
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.840]   Again, maybe the interesting story there is
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.840]   about the coverage of the trial.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.780]   So like the story is more complex and interesting
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:19.900]   than the actual horrific acts themselves.
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:23.540]   So to me, I don't, maybe I'm not knowledgeable enough,
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:27.520]   but to me, she's also truly evil.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.780]   I don't know where to, maybe you can help me
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:33.140]   to figure out who is more evil.
[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:37.460]   Just like you said, now the person that says,
[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:42.020]   it's okay, it's okay, that helps the evil doer
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:43.700]   or is it the evil doer themselves?
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.520]   I don't know, but I think she scares me
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.280]   more than Jeffrey Epstein somehow.
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.980]   There's people like that in the world too.
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:52.860]   - Like a Twitter poll, do you think it's more evil
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:56.020]   or less evil to kill someone 'cause you've been paid to do it
[01:22:56.020 --> 01:23:01.560]   and people, the winning answer was more evil
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:05.820]   and I said it was less because I think in that case,
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:07.640]   you can kind of check out, you could be like,
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.780]   this isn't my, I'm just doing a job.
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.960]   I think in a sense, if you have a certain mindset,
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.380]   like intellectually remove yourself from the situation,
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.380]   I'm just a conduit.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:23.080]   When you're talking, I haven't been following her case
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.800]   that that much.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.280]   - It's 'cause you mostly watch CNN
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.640]   and CNN's not covering it.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:31.280]   - Well, I think my broader point would be
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:37.000]   people who are untouchable and who know they're untouchable
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.440]   do much worse things than those of us
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.520]   who aren't that way can appreciate.
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:47.120]   Like I was just talking about on Twitter
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.060]   about Rosemary Kennedy.
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:51.640]   She was one of JFK's sisters.
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:55.460]   It's not clear whether she was developmentally disabled
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:58.480]   or had like depressive mental illness.
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:02.040]   There was something clearly off with her to some capacity
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:06.920]   and at age 23, they gave her a lobotomy
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:09.400]   and the thing with a lobotomy is you have to be conscious.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:10.840]   You don't, they don't put you under
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:12.280]   so you have to be counting backwards
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.920]   while their scalp is in your brain and they stopped
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:18.160]   but they stopped, they did too far.
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.480]   She became mentally like a two-year-old,
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.400]   never had bladder control for the rest of her life,
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:26.080]   couldn't really talk or walk and when that happened,
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:29.440]   they just put her away to some home
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:30.640]   and they never mentioned her again
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.440]   or they didn't tell the brothers or sisters where she went.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.440]   The lobotomy was only revealed in 1987
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.360]   and they pretended, oh, she's in this home for her kids
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.020]   with special needs and it's just like,
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:47.560]   like that to me is very, very scary
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.880]   that someone could do this to their,
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.840]   that people, I saw people respond like,
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.440]   oh, that was cutting edge technology at the time, ha ha
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:59.760]   but I'm like, I don't think that that was really done
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.000]   that frequently or be hearing more about it,
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.520]   all these botched lobotomies
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:07.380]   and my understanding is lobotomies are very hard to,
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:10.040]   like they would wanna do them
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.080]   if someone's like a mass murderer
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.400]   or like if someone's really bad,
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.080]   like if the person's left an invalid,
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:16.240]   like who cares kind of situation
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.720]   but when you're dealing with something like this,
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.880]   like she's not killing people, she's not assaulting people,
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:22.880]   she's just difficult
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:27.040]   because she's making your vaunted family look bad so--
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.240]   - So that's, to you, that's, what is that,
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.800]   like psychopathy or something like that,
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.280]   like you don't care about,
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.040]   you just, you do horrific things and you don't really care.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:37.360]   - I can't diagnose Joe Kennedy
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.680]   but what I would say, like if it's Jelaine Maxwell,
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:43.840]   I can't empathize because I don't understand,
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.800]   first of all, even in a positive sense,
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.640]   I don't know what it's like to be grooming my son
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:52.000]   to be the president and lost the other son in war,
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.240]   I don't know what that's like,
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.480]   I don't know what it's like to be so wealthy,
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:57.440]   like you have to give Joe Kennedy credit
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.260]   'cause a lot of what he was fighting for
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:03.160]   was to allow Irish people and Catholic people acceptance
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.960]   into like high society
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.200]   and he was up against a lot of pressure with that
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.400]   and he's like, I'm gonna screw these people,
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.400]   I'm gonna be recognized
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.080]   and we're gonna make people recognized,
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:13.200]   so somebody said for that,
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.260]   but I mean, I can't relate to people like him.
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:20.240]   - Yeah.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:23.360]   - But I mean, that like, is just terrifying,
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.920]   like I mean, one of the big reasons I'm an anarchist
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.080]   is like when you have someone
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.400]   who has that sense of amount of power over somebody else,
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.160]   a lot of times they're gonna do bad things
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.440]   and have no consequences.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.120]   - Do you think in a, just like Maxwell case
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.920]   and Epstein case,
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:45.180]   do you think they were trying to blackmail people?
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:48.420]   Like trying, what the conspiracy theories kind of describe,
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:52.160]   that's probably not too far away from reality,
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.780]   did they intentionally try to put powerful people
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:58.980]   in compromising situations
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:03.160]   so that they can basically get more and more power?
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:05.020]   - Yeah, I think that was a Vanity Fair piece
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:07.200]   that you're referring to or Fortune.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.360]   - Oh, sorry, I'm just referring to general concept.
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.800]   - Oh, so there was an article that broke this down
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.720]   'cause this article,
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.360]   it was either Fortune, Businessweek, Vanity Fair,
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.960]   I don't remember, a major, major reputable outlet
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.140]   and they made the report and made the point,
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:21.960]   they asked around and they go,
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:24.640]   this guy's a billionaire or extremely wealthy at least,
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.760]   no one I know ever traded with him,
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:27.920]   like where is his money coming from?
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.320]   There's no paper trail.
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:33.120]   So they're like, okay, if it's not trading
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:34.680]   and trades are public often,
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.960]   where's his money coming from?
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.840]   And it's also like, why are all these people
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.640]   allowing Epstein to be their business manager
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.760]   when he has no kind of track record to show for it?
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:47.240]   So the hypothesis was he would get people
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.240]   into uncompromising situations with underage girls,
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:54.920]   secretly film it and then he would blackmail them accordingly.
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:55.760]   - Well, I guess that's the question.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:56.720]   - That would make sense.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.680]   - I know it makes sense,
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.840]   but I also see a lot of evidence
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.040]   that he's just very charismatic in a room.
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:08.460]   And I've also seen, that's how human connections get made,
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:09.740]   like business deals get made.
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:12.620]   - Yeah, but where's his money coming from?
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:16.700]   - Oh, like they, rich people without blackmailing
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:21.700]   just like him close, like him as a friend.
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:24.580]   - I'm not arguing that, like, okay, I like Jeff Epstein,
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:25.900]   make sure you pull that quote.
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:26.740]   - Yes.
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:27.560]   - I'm a business person, I like Jeff Epstein.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.020]   - Michael Malice, I love Jeff.
[01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:29.860]   - Like or love?
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:31.100]   - Love, I'm in love with.
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:33.340]   - This escalated quickly.
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:36.780]   - I'm gonna hand over him to be my money manager
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:38.740]   to have 20% of my estate fine.
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:43.300]   Where is he making the money for that 20%?
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:44.820]   That's the thing that there's no paper trail
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:46.140]   of him trading or anything.
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:46.980]   So I can understand why.
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:47.820]   - Oh, I see, I see.
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:48.960]   - Yeah.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:49.800]   - Interesting.
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:53.220]   - What were your 2020 favorite moments?
[01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:54.580]   - You mean 2021?
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:55.420]   - Yeah, 2021.
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:56.240]   - Time flies when you have a kid.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.420]   - Clearly it's the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.
[01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:03.020]   It just really stands out to me, it's very moving.
[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:04.580]   This is why I bring it up.
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:06.020]   No.
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:07.020]   - Moving here.
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:09.080]   - So moving here, but for me,
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:12.540]   I think we actually didn't cover that with you
[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.180]   and I'd love to get your comment.
[01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:16.900]   'Cause you said it's for the first time
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:17.820]   in your life you moved.
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:21.100]   So it's not just about the place you go to,
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:24.540]   it's the actual act of moving is also a leap.
[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:25.380]   - Oh yeah.
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:28.820]   - The decision was that I'm going to
[01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:31.540]   give away my salary at MIT.
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:35.180]   So stop taking salary, give away the group.
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:39.020]   So students, no more research, the grant funding,
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:40.740]   and still keep an MIT affiliation
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.260]   just because I have friends and colleagues there
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:44.140]   still doing research, but giving away
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:46.860]   really primarily is the source of money.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:49.660]   So no salary and let it go to zero.
[01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:52.060]   Let my bank account go to zero.
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:57.060]   And take a leap in San Francisco or elsewhere.
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:02.220]   And as COVID broke out and a lot of people
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:04.180]   started talking to me about San Francisco,
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:05.620]   about the cynicism there.
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.340]   And I would go there and there was a kind of,
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:11.980]   so it's not all the woke stuff and all that kind of things,
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:13.700]   which is also a problem.
[01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:17.700]   It's less about dreaming about a big future,
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.420]   about building a big future,
[01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:22.620]   and more about some kind of identity politic battles
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:25.760]   that they're just, you could say some aspect
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.820]   in the positive light is important,
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:30.340]   but in a place like Silicon Valley, to me,
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:34.260]   the most important thing is to do big things
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:38.260]   and for that to be most of the conversation.
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:40.820]   And so that cynicism was there.
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:42.860]   And then I went to look at Austin
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:45.980]   and Austin was the opposite, it was the optimism.
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:48.700]   And you have people like, as I talked to,
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:52.680]   Elon was the optimistic about making this
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.300]   the capital of artificial intelligence
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.740]   and technology and so on.
[01:30:55.740 --> 01:31:00.740]   And then Mr. Joe Rogan, now just the optimism
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:03.740]   about making this the cultural capital of the world,
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:05.780]   of, I mean, specifically comedy,
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:09.620]   but it just radiates from them, just the excitement.
[01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:13.140]   And I've seen not many people of that nature in my life.
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:15.740]   And when I see that in their eyes, that engine,
[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:18.060]   that fire of wanting to create something special
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:21.660]   about the place, first of all, those people rarely fail.
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:22.480]   That's first of all.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.740]   And second of all, that's-- - It's contagious.
[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:25.700]   - It's contagious. - Yes, very contagious.
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:29.260]   - And so all of that combined, for me,
[01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:33.300]   2021 was the actual leap of taking the leap,
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:37.580]   saying, all right, well, I'm actually going to do this.
[01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:39.540]   So not just giving away the salary,
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:42.620]   not giving away all of that, but the whole thing.
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:44.980]   That's it, you just move to a place,
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:48.260]   there's an empty building, you know,
[01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:53.260]   and you're moving into it, and this is a new life.
[01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:56.780]   And that leap, I don't know, it's a scary leap to take,
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:59.700]   because I've taken that leap many times in my life,
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:02.820]   and this is where parents and all those kinds of cynicism
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:07.820]   is really destructive, because from a cynical perspective,
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:10.980]   is I worked at Google, so why leave Google?
[01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:15.020]   There's a very high-paying salary that you can have at Google.
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:18.120]   Then at MIT, why leave MIT?
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.780]   Like, it's MIT.
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:21.760]   This is, you've always dreamed about.
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.480]   Like, why do you get a PhD?
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:26.540]   You've loved MIT all your life, why leave MIT?
[01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:28.540]   I mean, this is the same process I've gone through
[01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:29.740]   with a lot of things in life.
[01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:32.340]   Like, you've been saying every single stage,
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:35.060]   and you need that, you need friends,
[01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:37.020]   you need support groups, and all those kinds of things
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.340]   that are extremely important.
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:40.700]   But in the end, it's about taking the leap.
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:43.300]   And for me, 2021 was this leap.
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:46.380]   And to me, one of the most beautiful things
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:49.260]   you can do in life is to take those leaps.
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:50.720]   - And that's something that I think
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:52.140]   is no longer a thing in New York.
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:53.740]   There's no sense of hope.
[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.240]   You don't go to New York now.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.800]   There's been such an assault,
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:01.580]   and intentionally or otherwise, maybe it's inevitable,
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:02.700]   they didn't have a choice,
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:04.620]   but there's been such an assault on creativity
[01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.420]   and small business in New York
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:09.420]   that no one, or very few people who are in New York
[01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:11.820]   right now think things are gonna get great soon.
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:14.940]   Whereas here, I feel it's, every day
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:17.380]   is just something exciting that's gonna happen.
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:18.580]   - And that's part of the culture
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:19.860]   and how the conversation goes.
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.100]   It's just in vogue to be cynical
[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:24.820]   in New York and San Francisco.
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:27.780]   I hope it changes 'cause what I love about New York
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:30.340]   and what I love about Austin also
[01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:33.380]   is the weirdos, the characters,
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:36.980]   just the variety of personalities
[01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:39.540]   that if you just walk around, you get to meet them.
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:41.220]   And I think New York still has that,
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:43.340]   but it has the extra cynicism on top of it.
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:45.620]   That's a negative.
[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:48.060]   I mean, just becoming friends with Joe,
[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:50.540]   he inspired me to be nicer to people,
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.820]   to not take myself seriously, to be humble,
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:58.700]   to celebrate friends, not to be competitive.
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:02.660]   Like all those things, since I started listening
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:04.380]   to his podcast from the very beginning,
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:06.860]   it just radiated from the guy.
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:09.100]   - The thing that people don't appreciate
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:13.340]   is Joe Rogan likes it when you bust his chops.
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:16.780]   I mean, a lot of people at that level,
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:18.580]   like if it's, "Oh, Mr. Rogan, you're laughing,"
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:20.140]   and everything they say, they don't want that.
[01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:22.940]   It's very phony and they feel uncomfortable
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:25.060]   'cause they know that everything they say is hilarious.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:28.900]   I remember I went with him, he was doing a performance here
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:32.260]   and I was, yeah, you were there.
[01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:35.980]   And he was doing his set and I'd reached the point now
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.540]   where I don't think of him as Joe Rogan.
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:39.540]   You know, it's just like my buddy's doing standup,
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:40.380]   you forget.
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:42.380]   And then I looked at the audience and I remember,
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:44.020]   I'm like, "Oh, this is like a religious experience
[01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:45.140]   for these people."
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:48.260]   But you forget who he is 'cause he doesn't carry himself
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:49.460]   like a big shot.
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:50.300]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:52.500]   And still, I mean, he gets competitive as fuck.
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:53.980]   Like I argue with him a lot.
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:58.060]   I mean, when I talked to Francis Collins and Pfizer CEO,
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:34:59.820]   you better believe I heard from Joe.
[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:04.180]   And then we would just get super drunk and argue about it.
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:06.020]   So it's, I mean, it's beautiful.
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.380]   And he gets really passionate.
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:13.380]   So it's not like easy to argue with him, but that's great.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:16.740]   - When you don't take it personally, it's fun.
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:17.940]   - As you and I discussed,
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:20.340]   and I'm sure he wouldn't mind us saying this,
[01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:24.020]   but like that moment when you first get a text
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:26.180]   from Joe Rogan and it's some boomer meme,
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:29.460]   like I finally felt like I've arrived as a person.
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:30.740]   - A boomer meme?
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.180]   What kind of boomer meme are we talking about?
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:33.460]   - Like he just sends some silly meme,
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:34.620]   but it's just like, this is the kind of thing
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:36.620]   you can imagine someone's uncle posting on Facebook.
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:39.220]   It's Joe Rogan texting it to you.
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:40.060]   - Yeah.
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:42.220]   I mean, for me also with Elon, obviously,
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:43.380]   there's a few people.
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:45.900]   I'm just saying folks that people know.
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:48.900]   Also Jim Keller, who's worked with Elon.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.720]   So I've had conversations with them,
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:52.500]   'cause it's just my line of work.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:56.180]   They're realizing that everything is possible in this world.
[01:35:56.180 --> 01:35:57.500]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.420]   Which is not the Russian mindset.
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:00.340]   - Yeah, well, okay.
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:02.500]   All right, let's--
[01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:05.380]   - Start with Donald Nudge.
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:07.420]   - Start with Donald Nudge.
[01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:10.540]   Yeah, it's what Elon calls first principles thinking,
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:13.700]   but really it's just not being limited
[01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:15.100]   by the constraints of the past.
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:15.940]   - Yes.
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:18.220]   - And so saying like, okay, this is how things
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:21.020]   have been done, but can be done much, much better.
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:23.340]   And that has to do with manufacture.
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:27.600]   How do we do this 10 times cheaper?
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:31.060]   Like everyone says it's super expensive,
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:32.860]   but does it really need to be?
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:34.620]   This is more of a question about manufacture,
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.180]   about how to build a product,
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:37.940]   how to actually have a product that's scaled,
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:39.500]   that has an impact.
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:42.340]   And just having a very serious engineering,
[01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:45.140]   like to the level of physics,
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:49.340]   discussion about building a thing and fucking doing it
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:52.100]   and just being around people that did it.
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:57.100]   And basically, literally or figuratively said,
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:59.940]   fuck you to everybody in the room
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:01.860]   that said they can't do it.
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:03.180]   And that energy.
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:06.220]   So that I've gotten to know Elon a lot better in 2021.
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.300]   That to me, it's like everything, the whole thing,
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:11.700]   that moving here and being surrounded
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.660]   by that optimistic energy,
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:16.560]   and then the individual interactions with people
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:21.220]   that refuse to be like brought down by the,
[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:23.300]   yeah, the cynicism of the world.
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:24.140]   The naysayers.
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:28.020]   That to me is what I'm gonna remember this year for.
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:31.660]   And I hope it like materializes
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:34.820]   into something concrete here in Austin.
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:36.460]   And I feel it's doing that.
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:39.780]   - I really am curious to be a fly on the wall.
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:41.020]   I'm sure it'll happen at some point,
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:43.260]   watching you and Elon talk to each other.
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.420]   'Cause he's even more of a robot than you.
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:48.020]   He was on the Babylon Bee podcast,
[01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:49.860]   and I was honored to be able to be in the room
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:51.540]   while this was happening.
[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:54.380]   And with the guys at the Bee do,
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:55.780]   at the end of every podcast,
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:57.940]   they have like 10 questions.
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:37:59.380]   I don't think this, remember this was one of those.
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:01.220]   No, no, this, and they go to Elon,
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:05.220]   would you rather be Batman or Iron Man?
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:08.020]   'Cause they're both like multimillionaire industrialists.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:09.740]   And Elon being Elon is like,
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:11.980]   well, let's think this through.
[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:12.980]   There's different kinds of bats.
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:15.780]   You've got fruit bats and you've got insect bats.
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:16.620]   Why it's called Batman?
[01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:17.940]   Batman makes you fly, right?
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:18.780]   Bats can fly.
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:20.740]   And I'm just sitting there with the whole,
[01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:22.100]   like dude, just answer the question.
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:23.260]   (laughing)
[01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:24.900]   It was so literal.
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:26.780]   I was like, damn.
[01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:28.420]   - I guess by this point,
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:30.380]   I've released a podcast with him.
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:32.260]   That's several hours,
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:34.980]   and it's exactly as you would imagine.
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:37.020]   - It's exactly as you would imagine.
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.980]   - There was this, did you watch the movie Her?
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:40.820]   - Yes, of course.
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:41.940]   - So there's that one scene,
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:43.980]   it's when, is it Joaquin,
[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:45.060]   who's the lead character?
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:46.540]   - Yeah, Joaquin Phoenix.
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:47.660]   - Yeah, so he's the lead
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:49.140]   and he falls in love with Siri basically,
[01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:51.020]   who's played by Scarlett Johansson.
[01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:55.060]   And there's another artificial AI that she's talking to.
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:57.180]   And she's like, oh, can I,
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:59.300]   permission to go into nonverbal communication
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.780]   with this professor?
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:02.620]   And the guy's like, sure.
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:04.820]   And they just start talking to each other in their robot.
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:06.100]   And I'm just imagining the two of you
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:07.940]   having this mind meld.
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:11.260]   - Well, that, so there's both the humor of that,
[01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:13.460]   but also the practical nature
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:15.500]   of the kind of conversations you have.
[01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:19.820]   It's so great because it's problem solving mode.
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:20.900]   - Okay, yeah, yeah, okay.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:21.860]   - It's so cool. - That is fun.
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:22.700]   That is exciting.
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:25.660]   - Because like you stop completing sentences.
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:26.820]   I actually feel at home
[01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:30.140]   because you don't need to say the full sentences anymore.
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:32.660]   You could just like say random words
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:34.140]   and you start to understand
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:35.620]   what you're talking about.
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:37.700]   And then you can have multiple conversations
[01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:40.300]   at the same time and go on these tangents.
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:42.900]   One of the biggest problems I have with podcasting,
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:45.860]   for me, talking, I have to finish my sentences.
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:48.500]   I have to actually finish making a point,
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:49.740]   which is a big problem.
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:51.100]   'Cause there's like a listener
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:53.260]   that needs to hear the point being finished
[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:57.260]   as opposed to completing your sentences
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:59.780]   inside your own mind.
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:02.420]   And like the thing I find is useful to,
[01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:03.940]   Elon does the exact same thing,
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:08.740]   is when the line of thinking is no longer useful,
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:11.820]   you just ran, you just switched to the next thing.
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:13.620]   You just leave that whole thing behind.
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:14.980]   You don't need a nice transition.
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:16.620]   You don't need any of that.
[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:20.020]   And also just, it's the first principles thing.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:24.820]   It's like zooming in on the elephant in the room.
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:25.660]   I love that.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:26.900]   It's so energizing.
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:29.020]   Just that's what I love about engineers.
[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:33.660]   It's not the maybe most eloquent communication style,
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:36.100]   but I love it.
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:36.940]   What about you?
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:38.100]   So you said moving.
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:40.140]   - The book.
[01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:41.180]   - The book.
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:42.020]   What else?
[01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:46.260]   And you've been really excited about,
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:48.380]   so that's "Anarchist Handbook,"
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:51.700]   but you've also been nonstop excited about "White Bill."
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:53.500]   That was most of this year.
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:55.580]   You've been actually made significant progress.
[01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:58.060]   - Yeah, I'm on page 40 of the second draft.
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:40:59.220]   And it's really kind of funny
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:02.500]   'cause when you're doing your, I think, 10th book,
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:03.540]   I lost track already.
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:06.660]   The first draft is actually pretty good.
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:07.500]   I'm going back and like,
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.740]   "All right, this is gonna be a whole slog."
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.060]   I'm like, "Oh, I just have to cut and paste this
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:11.740]   "and basically tweak a few words."
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:15.780]   So I did a good job with the first draft.
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:18.780]   It's also funny when you're writing how,
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:24.460]   and I guess this is the mark of a good professional writer.
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:29.860]   My personal feelings don't match
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:32.900]   how the characters in the book come off.
[01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:36.300]   Like I have a lot of fondness for people
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:38.580]   like Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman
[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:40.420]   and their early on in the book,
[01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:42.180]   but they're not good people.
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:44.740]   And I'm writing it objectively and whatever,
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:45.780]   and I'm reading it, so I'm like,
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:50.780]   "They come off much worse than my personal appraisal of them."
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:53.900]   So it's kind of interesting as a writer
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:54.980]   when you're watching it,
[01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:57.100]   I guess kind of like an attorney, right?
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:58.580]   Like you can have a situation
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:41:59.900]   where you as an attorney,
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:02.660]   you have a lot of fondness for your client,
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:04.740]   but you realize that they probably did this thing,
[01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:06.900]   or you could not, it could be other way.
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:07.900]   Like they're innocent,
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:10.220]   but it's hard for you to make a good case for them
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:11.820]   because the data's not there.
[01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:13.900]   - Can you actually talk about your writing process
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:14.740]   in several ways?
[01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:15.740]   So one, your writing process,
[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:18.900]   but two, by way of advice of how to write.
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:20.220]   You've talked about in the past,
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:24.220]   like your first draft is these kind of disparate
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:25.740]   or more chaotic in that you don't,
[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:27.380]   in the same way maybe I was saying
[01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:28.580]   in the engineering discussion,
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:30.180]   you don't complete the sentences.
[01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:32.940]   It's just thoughts. - Yeah, so the first
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:36.500]   like real good writing advice I remember getting
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:38.540]   was this book by Peggy Noonan
[01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:40.860]   called "What I Saw at the Revolution."
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:43.100]   And she was a Ronald Reagan speechwriter.
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:45.340]   She still writes for the Wall Street Journal.
[01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:48.420]   The book I bought was at a used bookstore
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:50.900]   in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania when I was in college.
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:52.620]   The spine is cocked, I still have it.
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:53.860]   It was 99 cents.
[01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:57.500]   And she talked, when you're writing for a president,
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:00.020]   this is no joke, especially for a president
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:02.140]   who's this great communicator, Reagan.
[01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:05.580]   And you have to be very inspirational,
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:07.100]   but also not come off as corny,
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.860]   which is very hard to do.
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:10.260]   And she in the book talks about
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:12.100]   how she wrote speeches for him,
[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:14.540]   how she, I'm paraphrasing her,
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:17.620]   and I haven't read her book in a couple of decades,
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.180]   but basically she would write like a brain dump
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:21.180]   and it's just garbage.
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:22.020]   And she was like, "That's okay.
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:23.380]   "Just get it all out there."
[01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:26.180]   And then there's that expression,
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:27.500]   "All writing is editing."
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.780]   So for the "White Pill" specifically,
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:32.660]   this is, I don't know if it's the most ambitious book
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:33.500]   I've ever done.
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:34.860]   Your reader, I think, is more ambitious
[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:36.380]   'cause that's all of North Korea's history
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:37.620]   and it's written in somebody else's voice,
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:38.860]   not persons of Martian.
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.980]   - And you, like you mentioned,
[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:42.460]   had to read a giant number of books.
[01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:44.540]   - Yes, 60 books as research, yeah.
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:46.060]   - Well, maybe can we just pause?
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:48.700]   Can you say what "White Pill" is about?
[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:52.420]   - Sure, it's about hope and it's a tale of good and evil.
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:55.700]   And I think that's, I don't wanna tip my hand too much.
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:57.740]   But people are always like, "How do you think,
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:59.100]   "why are you so hopeful?"
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:00.780]   And I'm not hopeful on an emotional level.
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:03.220]   I'm hopeful because looking at history,
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:04.620]   I think there's certain things
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:08.660]   that will certainly happen again,
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.540]   but it's not at all implausible to happen again
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:12.500]   and that the good guys will win.
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.060]   And this is one of those cases.
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:19.060]   So, you know, I had, the book took on a life of its own.
[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:21.660]   It's very different from how I originally conceived it.
[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:24.500]   I originally conceived it as a kind of retelling
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:26.700]   of Camus' philosophy.
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:29.660]   Ryan Holiday, who we used to be close friends with,
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:30.580]   I haven't talked to him in a while,
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:32.380]   he has a whole kind of cottage industry
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:34.020]   based on the Stoics of the past.
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:35.380]   I'm like, "Okay, can I ask him once,
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:36.220]   "can I do this with Camus?"
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.580]   He said, "Sure."
[01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:40.340]   And then I reread Camus recently
[01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:43.340]   and it wasn't what I had remembered.
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:44.620]   - Oh, so can we pause on that?
[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:45.860]   I apologize to interrupt.
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:47.280]   So it's interesting.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:50.380]   So he kind of took ideas from Stoics
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:54.940]   and started to kind of use it as a book
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:57.020]   that gives you advice about how to live life
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:58.500]   from the Stoic perspectives.
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:01.060]   And you were thinking,
[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:04.140]   is there something in existentialism, absurdism,
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:07.620]   or something specifically in Camus' thinking?
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:10.700]   Or I think you've mentioned the myth of Sisyphus,
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:12.860]   specifically like his philosophical work.
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:13.860]   - Yeah.
[01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:15.020]   - So you were trying to see, like,
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:16.620]   is there, can I resurrect this?
[01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:17.460]   That's actually,
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:23.420]   I would think that's an interesting project.
[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:25.180]   And it's sad to hear that
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:31.780]   it didn't materialize in exactly that form
[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:33.820]   'cause I thought there would be a lot in that.
[01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:35.540]   - So I had Douglas Murray on my show
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:36.540]   and he also made the point,
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:37.860]   like, when you go back and read Camus,
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:39.020]   there's not that much there.
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:43.500]   The myth of Sisyphus is not at all how I remembered it.
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:47.020]   The vast bulk of that book is like literary criticism.
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:48.260]   So he's talking about Dostoevsky
[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:49.100]   and all these different people
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:50.420]   who are embodiments of the absurd.
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:52.900]   But I'm like, there's not much to take from here.
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:55.460]   This actual title essay is basically
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:59.540]   like a six-chapter essay at the back of the book,
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:02.540]   which it's good for what it is,
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:04.500]   but there's not that much there to draw.
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:07.980]   I'm extremely, he's a great hero of mine.
[01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:10.900]   I think his life is just enormously admirable.
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:14.460]   He fought very hard against the Nazi occupation.
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:16.780]   His book, "The Plague," which I find unreadable,
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:20.100]   is an allegory about Germany conquering France
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:20.940]   and so on and so forth.
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:22.180]   - Wait a minute.
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:23.820]   Why is "The Plague" unreadable?
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:25.860]   - It's the kind of book where reading the book
[01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:27.740]   doesn't add anything to the plot.
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:31.620]   The plot is a plague comes, sweeps over the town,
[01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:34.180]   destroys a lot of life, and vanishes as quickly as it came.
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:35.380]   You don't need to read the book now.
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:37.140]   Like, you get the point.
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:39.100]   - I deeply disagree with you.
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.100]   Yes, of course I've read "The Plague."
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:43.780]   - To me, I mean, "The Plague" is about the doctor
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:48.100]   and it's about love and it's about the different roles
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:53.100]   that humans take in a time of tragedy like the plague.
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:55.580]   Also, it's an allegory.
[01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:58.500]   So you can start to think about what,
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:02.100]   whether it's Nazi Germany, whatever you think that is.
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:03.820]   To me, though, that was about love
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:08.060]   and about the role, the highest ideal being the doctor
[01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:10.780]   that sacrifices themselves for others
[01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:12.780]   and still has love and hope.
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:17.780]   I mean, to me, the way that story is told,
[01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:19.100]   I think, has a lot of meaning.
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:22.100]   It's like, to me, you saying that, it's interesting
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:24.620]   you say it this way, but to me, it's like saying
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:28.700]   Animal Farm doesn't need to be read
[01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:31.380]   because it's an obvious story.
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:34.340]   - I don't think there's much plot to "The Plague."
[01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:36.340]   I think Animal Farm has a very long plot
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:38.740]   and a complex plot.
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:42.180]   - But there's experiences within.
[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:44.100]   So the situation is set up in plague
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:48.540]   and there's experiences that start to reveal a philosophy.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:51.660]   So yeah, it's not very plot-driven.
[01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:56.700]   So I would say you still should read it,
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:59.740]   but the plot doesn't, like you didn't give away
[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:01.620]   anything currently to me.
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:04.860]   So some books are just, I mean,
[01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:07.860]   "Ayn Rand" is similar to that in a sense.
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:10.020]   Like the plot is not as important
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:12.100]   as the behavior of the different people
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:12.980]   in that plot.
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:15.260]   - I think she's very plot-heavy.
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:16.820]   - No, she has plot, but I'm saying
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:19.260]   that's not necessarily the important thing.
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:21.940]   To me, the behavior of the people is the important thing.
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:22.780]   - Sure, but--
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:26.420]   - You could like separate it into a bunch of blog posts
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:28.060]   and they stand on their own.
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:31.300]   I would have to think about that with "Ayn Rand."
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:35.020]   She does, through the plot, create a world
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:36.660]   where you start to understand
[01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:38.580]   the different values that people have.
[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:40.540]   But yeah.
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:43.500]   But that's what the plot serves.
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:46.300]   Yeah, I would have to think.
[01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:48.300]   But in "The Plague," it's the behavior of the people
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:49.460]   that's really important.
[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:52.020]   In the same, I mean, "The Stranger," too.
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:57.020]   I mean, these like, I'm trying to scramble here
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:48:59.860]   for books I really appreciate that don't have a plot.
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:04.860]   I mean, "Notes from Underground."
[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:07.300]   So obviously, Dostoevsky has a huge amount of plot
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:09.580]   in most of his work.
[01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:11.940]   Herman Hesse has a huge amount of plot.
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:13.220]   - Thomas Mann doesn't have the plot.
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:14.460]   He's the one who doesn't have plots.
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:15.580]   - Thomas Mann.
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:17.660]   Would you say Kafka has a plot?
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:20.020]   - I think Kafka's very heavy plot-driven.
[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:21.820]   - Yeah, but I just don't see that, I guess--
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:25.100]   - I guess "Metamorphosis" doesn't really have a plot.
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.500]   - Yeah, but there's like crawling around.
[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:28.340]   - But it's like a vignette.
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:29.180]   It's not really like--
[01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:30.940]   - It's a short, yeah.
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:34.140]   "The Hunger Artist," one of my probably favorite
[01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:35.980]   short stories is that kind of a short story.
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:38.620]   It's a pretty long short story of Kafka's.
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:40.300]   It's really interesting.
[01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:42.380]   It's about a man, I don't know if you read it.
[01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:44.100]   - No, I don't think so.
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:47.780]   - It's about a man that is like a freak
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:52.460]   in a sense that his skill is that he can fast
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:55.180]   for a long time, and then people gather on the cage
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:57.740]   and look at him as he fasts.
[01:49:57.740 --> 01:50:00.240]   I don't actually remember if he's in a cage or not.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:03.380]   And eventually, he fasts so long
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:04.980]   that people don't even care anymore.
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:06.660]   Like, they just leave.
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:11.660]   So there's a, it has to do something.
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:15.620]   It makes me think about like, don't become,
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:19.880]   the way you live, don't become like a freak show,
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:21.420]   a circus act.
[01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:25.340]   Like, live for an ideal, live for something
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:26.540]   that brings you joy.
[01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:28.260]   - Or don't live for the sake of attention.
[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:29.860]   - For the sake of attention, that's what you put.
[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.500]   - Yeah, that's, yeah.
[01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:34.660]   - Yeah, anyway, so I rudely interrupted
[01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:35.980]   'cause you were talking about the plague
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:39.220]   and connecting it to the writing process of "White Pill."
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:43.160]   - Yeah, well, anyway, so how I was writing this one,
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:46.660]   I just had a first draft of notes,
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:48.900]   and it's not in chronological order.
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:51.140]   It's like, I read certain books as research,
[01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:54.100]   and then I had the pull quotes that was necessary there.
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:56.700]   And now I'm basically rearranging everything
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:01.160]   and putting it, so the book started as Ryan Holiday's--
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:02.460]   - Right. - Sequel to Ryan Holiday
[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:03.300]   as "Caboo."
[01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:06.140]   The working title would have been "The Point of Tears"
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:10.540]   because there's this, Caboo's a great quote maker,
[01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:12.420]   and he has this line about, "Man must live,
[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:15.180]   "live to the point of tears," which I think is just,
[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:17.980]   what I love about him is,
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:22.700]   Caboo, he always comes off as like he's clenching his teeth.
[01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:25.500]   He's clenching his teeth both in terms of
[01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:29.340]   like barely mitigated rage at injustice,
[01:51:29.340 --> 01:51:30.940]   like when he sees people suffering,
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:34.900]   it just really makes him just upset to the core.
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:39.900]   But also this sense of not taking life for granted
[01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:43.220]   and kind of just pushing yourself
[01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:44.300]   and pushing the boundaries,
[01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:48.200]   and his point being that life is inherently meaningless,
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:51.300]   which gives a great opportunity to impute meaning to it,
[01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:53.380]   to create our own meaning to life.
[01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:58.140]   - So taking the main essay from "Myth of Sisyphus,"
[01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:00.980]   that was the origin story for "The White Pill,"
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:02.780]   but then it became something completely different.
[01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:04.700]   - And so then it became,
[01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:06.780]   how are you so optimistic in the face
[01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:08.060]   of everything that's going on in the world?
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:11.180]   And I started writing it when COVID started hitting.
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:14.700]   And 'cause again, I'm not optimistic
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:17.180]   'cause of some temperament of mine.
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:20.540]   I'm optimistic because people talk about how,
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.080]   oh, if the US didn't exist,
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:25.860]   China would just become an empire and take over everything.
[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:27.780]   Empires are expensive,
[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:31.500]   and they, like look at the British empire,
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:33.100]   look at the Soviet Union.
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:35.820]   It's not automatically sustainable.
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:40.300]   It costs a lot of things to make sure
[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:43.960]   when you're geographically all over the world,
[01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:45.980]   literally, to keep everyone in line.
[01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.780]   It's not at all like a super villain movie.
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:51.180]   Once it happens, it's the happy ending for them.
[01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:54.380]   So yeah, that was the start.
[01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:56.480]   And I'm like, all right, let me tell,
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:53:00.040]   one thing I'm good at is telling stories.
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:01.480]   So this is really a--
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:04.240]   - So this is narrative plot driven.
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:06.280]   - Very, very plot driven.
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:07.680]   And also heavily character driven,
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:09.360]   but the characters are real.
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:10.920]   - Yeah, got it.
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:14.160]   So it's interesting to kind of mention,
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:17.160]   what does the first draft kind of look like
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:20.560]   in terms of what kind of things do you plop down?
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:21.840]   - Oh, so it'll be like,
[01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:24.040]   let's suppose I just read some book
[01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:25.360]   called "The Guillotine at Work,"
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:27.920]   which was an early book attacking Lenin
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:30.120]   from the anarcho-communist perspective.
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:31.720]   So it'll just be like all the different quotes,
[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:33.400]   like a paragraph here, double space,
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:37.120]   another paragraph, blah, blah, blah, so on and so forth.
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:38.680]   Whereas for other sections
[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:41.960]   where I wasn't just using the book as research,
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:44.800]   there would be like talking about McKinley getting shot.
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:46.820]   Like it's just me writing the narrative
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:48.760]   and that I could just pretty much copy paste
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.160]   into the second draft.
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:54.120]   - By way of advice, would you give that as advice?
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:55.760]   Is that a good way to do it?
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:57.800]   Is that a very peculiar way your brain works?
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:59.400]   - No, so this is actually advice
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:02.300]   I feel comfortable giving to people who are trying to write.
[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:05.880]   Because it's just like with the gym, right?
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:09.740]   If you did seven sets, seven, excuse me, reps last week,
[01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:11.600]   and you did eight this week,
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:13.000]   it's psychologically motivating
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.340]   'cause you're going in the right direction
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:16.040]   and the human mind extrapolates.
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:18.960]   So make sure, tell yourself,
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:22.220]   I'm gonna get a page done today or two pages done.
[01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:23.360]   Sit your ass in front of the computer,
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.720]   you're not allowed to get up until you get those two pages.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.640]   It doesn't matter if they look at garbage
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:32.280]   because if you have a 300 page first draft and it's crap,
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:34.080]   at least you have something to work with
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.640]   and that's a big number.
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:37.680]   So if you're gonna, the thing is,
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:39.920]   since the first draft is gonna be crap,
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:41.600]   if you're editing as you write,
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.360]   it's gonna be extremely discouraging.
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:44.880]   And it's also trying to drive
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:46.960]   and then doing reverse at the same time.
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:49.600]   It's a completely nonsensical way to do it.
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:52.060]   Get it all out there, don't look it over.
[01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:53.720]   If you have a great line, put it in your phone
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.840]   and then add it to the draft.
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:58.020]   So it'll be a complete slog,
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:54:59.940]   but editing that slog is gonna be a lot easier
[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:01.120]   than creating it to begin with.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:03.360]   - And when you see those disparate lines
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.080]   all laid out on the page,
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:08.800]   how difficult is it to then start stitching it together?
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:13.040]   Do you find that when you look at a list of those things,
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:15.720]   the final product will look very different?
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:16.560]   - Yes.
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:17.520]   - Or will you actually use those lines?
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:18.800]   - No, I will use those lines.
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:20.800]   Then I have a file called scraps.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:24.560]   So if the line's no longer used, I put it in my scrap pile.
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:26.320]   - I'd love to see what's in the scrap pile.
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:27.280]   - Okay, yeah, sure.
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:29.880]   One of the things I've been pulling scraps
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:32.620]   is a lot of times when I was earlier writing,
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:35.400]   I would have contemporary references.
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:37.520]   And I realized that that's bad
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:42.520]   because I want the reader to be in the past as the present.
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:45.600]   So if you're talking about, let's say 1901,
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:46.800]   and then you're referring to Obama,
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:49.300]   that screws people up, so I had to pull all those.
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:53.560]   - Okay, let's talk about some New Year's resolutions.
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:55.200]   You ever do New Year's resolutions?
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:56.120]   You ever think like that?
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:59.240]   Like take a special day in the year
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:02.560]   to think about how you're gonna try to change yourself?
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:03.960]   Do you try to transform yourself
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:06.080]   every single day when you wake up?
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:07.760]   - Well, I usually have several projects
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:08.880]   I'm working on at once,
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.280]   so there's always incremental progress on those.
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:13.480]   - It's nice to have a deadline.
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:18.080]   By the end of 2022, I'll accomplish this.
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.520]   - Kind of like to hold yourself responsible.
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:24.000]   And then you could do that at the beginning of the year
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.480]   to think about that.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:29.040]   Both philosophically, like what kind of big,
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:31.320]   not projects that you can quantify,
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:33.280]   but more like how can I change my life?
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:35.960]   Or like I mentioned, take the leap of different kinds.
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:38.840]   And then there's specific things like finish the book.
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:44.560]   - Years ago, and I think on some level,
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:45.520]   you much less than me,
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:48.280]   but I think you're increasing in this direction.
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:51.680]   I realized I have to learn how to be a surfer
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:53.240]   and not a driver.
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:56.560]   Because when you reach the level we're at in our careers
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:59.080]   or in our place in the culture,
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:00.720]   a lot of this is luck.
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:03.640]   And a lot of this is just like,
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:05.120]   I'm just going along for the ride
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:07.680]   because it's kind of counterintuitive.
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:10.320]   Like the success of the "Anarchist Handbook"
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:11.400]   was counterintuitive.
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:17.600]   So all I'm hoping for is getting the book done.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:21.800]   I am extremely proud of it.
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:28.520]   And just also building a,
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:31.360]   we had Thanksgiving together at Blair's house,
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:36.320]   just building a great upcoming community here in Austin,
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:39.560]   which has happened very quickly.
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:43.480]   There's gonna be another surprise here.
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:46.520]   There's a girl named Natalie Sidesurf
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:48.880]   and she makes these ultra realistic cakes.
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:50.320]   Like if you've seen those cakes online
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:51.680]   where it looks like you're cutting a puppy,
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:52.960]   like she makes those kinds of things.
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:54.720]   So she's here.
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:55.800]   - In Austin? - Yeah.
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:57.680]   - Oh cool, like moved permanently?
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.840]   - I think she's been here for a while.
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:00.040]   I've never, I haven't met her yet,
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:01.840]   but I just kind of chatted with her.
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:06.840]   So there's just so many scenes happening here
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:10.120]   that are overlapping.
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:12.280]   - So in general, finish the book,
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:14.400]   keep building your community.
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:16.040]   I mean, you've already been doing that here.
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:17.400]   You've been here several months.
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:19.640]   - I've been making a point to introduce people to each other
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:22.240]   and everyone's just really getting along very well.
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:23.440]   - That's great.
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:25.200]   And the book is the focus.
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:26.560]   - The book is the focus.
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:28.600]   - What about the podcast that you're doing?
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:29.680]   You're welcome.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:33.560]   - Yeah, I mean, I enjoy it and it's been growing a lot.
[01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:35.440]   I finally got a new computer,
[01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:37.800]   which my friend Jay installed
[01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:40.440]   so I can have a decent camera 'cause of my old,
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:43.920]   this is my mindset as a hoarder.
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:47.360]   Like I was more interested in spending money
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:49.680]   on a Pareto autograph than actually getting a computer
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:52.640]   that's from the 20th century.
[01:58:52.640 --> 01:59:00.840]   But I'm such an old school person in that in my head,
[01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:03.760]   podcasts are like so ephemeral.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.640]   There's some episodes of my podcast I'm really proud of.
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:10.800]   And there's a lot of friendships I've made as a result of it
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:12.480]   that really mean a lot to me, no question.
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:14.640]   It's made my life a profoundly better place.
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:17.360]   But it's not the same as that book on the shelf,
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:19.480]   especially when the book is something
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:22.880]   that I think matters much more than I do.
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:24.200]   - Yeah, there's a permanence to it.
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:28.360]   There's a seriousness to laying down the words on paper,
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:30.240]   like really giving them thought.
[01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:31.640]   - Yeah.
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:32.480]   - That's true.
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:35.440]   But I'm a huge fan of podcasts.
[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:36.880]   - You don't listen to podcasts much,
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:39.040]   which is fascinating to--
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:40.120]   - Yeah, like at all.
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:42.320]   And I don't know how mine is so successful.
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:43.960]   It's just, yeah.
[01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:48.720]   - Yeah, yeah, I just love the medium.
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:52.840]   I love the authenticity, the realness of the medium.
[01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:53.800]   That's really nice.
[01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:57.480]   - I just understood for the, it's starting to click
[01:59:57.480 --> 02:00:01.480]   because like my pal Blair White, she was just done Rogan.
[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:06.120]   And the first 10 minutes, I was so angry.
[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:08.680]   Like I was sitting there like yelling at the screen
[02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:11.920]   'cause Joe and Blair, you would think
[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:14.440]   that they're gonna start talking about Trump
[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:16.920]   or trans issues or moving to Austin.
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:19.120]   They start talking about shark reproduction
[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:21.560]   and neither of these dumbasses knew anything about it.
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:22.920]   And I know a lot about it.
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:23.760]   And they're like, "Oh, is it like this?
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:25.080]   "Oh, do the sharks lay eggs?"
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:25.920]   And I'm sitting there, I'm like,
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:29.040]   "If you don't know why you're talking about this, why?
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:30.120]   "Why are you talking?"
[02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:33.240]   And I could also see why people like these shows
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:34.680]   'cause they feel like they're friends with the people,
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:35.600]   like they're sitting in the room.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:36.720]   'Cause I felt like I was in that room
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:38.720]   and I wanted to shake both of them.
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:39.760]   - You're in the room.
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:42.200]   So now what about transforming yourself?
[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:43.880]   Any resolutions like that?
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:46.520]   - Oh, I'm doing a slight bulk now.
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:48.680]   So I'm almost at my heaviest weight ever,
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:50.480]   but I couldn't go to the gym this week
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:52.760]   'cause I was a little under weather.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:55.080]   So that's a little frustrating, but yeah.
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:57.760]   - So are we gonna get some more modeling pics?
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:00.280]   What are we, what's, is there goals there?
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:03.360]   - So my heaviest, I'm 4'8".
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:05.760]   The heaviest I've ever been was when,
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:06.800]   and this is when I was like--
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:09.000]   - He's exaggerating, he's not that tall.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000]   - That's the metric.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.640]   - Oh, sorry, are you talking about your height?
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:13.480]   - Yeah. - 4'8"?
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:14.520]   Okay. - Yeah.
[02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:15.560]   - Barely 4'6".
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:17.840]   - So the heaviest I've ever been
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:19.680]   when I was like really high body fat,
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:21.240]   'cause I was just, 'cause I learned,
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:22.600]   'cause I couldn't gain weight as a kid.
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:24.200]   So when I figured out I could actually gain weight,
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:27.440]   I like, I was 164.5.
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:31.480]   So I wanna hit 165 and then see, take it from there.
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:33.400]   I have a friend who's been helping me,
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:35.920]   my buddy Trey Goff, and this kid's stronger,
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:38.920]   his, Jake, his username on Instagram is stronger,
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:40.840]   both the number five instead of the letter.
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:41.920]   - Nice. - The number five
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:43.760]   instead of the letter S, but he does,
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:46.800]   I've never, it looks like it's Photoshop,
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:48.240]   like your brain can't process it.
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:49.440]   You know the human flag?
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.920]   - No, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:53.880]   - But he does human flag pushups.
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:56.640]   - Wow. - So he is
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:01:58.760]   horizontal, parallel to the ground, right?
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:00.880]   He's holding himself up like a flag,
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:03.400]   but he could also do this while,
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:05.680]   so he's moving parallel to the earth,
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:08.520]   side to side while, it's just crazy.
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:09.480]   - That's really difficult.
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:11.360]   So you're interested in that kind of stuff?
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:13.640]   - No, but I'm saying like he's been helping me out,
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:15.000]   so like the guy knows what he's doing.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.320]   He's just a really impressive kid.
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:18.400]   - I love that kind of stuff, like body weight stuff.
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:22.320]   So my primary mode of working out
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:24.520]   is very like the, you ever seen Leon,
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:27.080]   like the professional that, with Natalie Portman,
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:28.360]   that movie? - Yeah.
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:30.320]   - It's like I have a pull-up thing,
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:31.960]   I just do pushups and pull-ups.
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:35.040]   It's very like I'm just missing the milk.
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:37.200]   I like working out at home just like that.
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:40.560]   And the body weight stuff, you can go so much with it,
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:43.520]   and it's super functional for everything else you live in,
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:46.440]   for life, for living life well.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:48.480]   - I'm on the other hand, I don't care about functionality.
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.800]   The thing that really bothers me,
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:52.800]   like I go, I know Joe's thinking of opening up a gym,
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:54.080]   like a private gym.
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:58.440]   There's only like one power cage here at the Gold's I go to.
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:02:59.720]   I don't know what source, if there's only one,
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:01.360]   or that sometimes people aren't using it.
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:04.880]   I'm like, no one's doing deadlifts in here, no one, just me.
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:06.440]   It's Gold's.
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:08.520]   - By the way, I don't wanna say where,
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:12.520]   I'll tell you off, but there's a few really
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:14.800]   like ghetto places around Austin
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:17.960]   that are just like these shitty gyms
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:20.040]   that nobody wants to go to, but they have a rack,
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:21.880]   they have like, if you wanna lift heavy,
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:23.480]   that kind of stuff. - But I lay 24 hours,
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:24.840]   that's the thing, Gold's.
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:29.040]   - Oh, but there are 24 hours in the following way.
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:32.520]   There's a code, and you just go in,
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:35.120]   and you turn on the lights, and then you work out.
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:36.920]   - I don't wanna meet people.
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:39.240]   - Exactly, well-- - That's just not true.
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:40.760]   - Sometimes there's people and they're great.
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:43.000]   - Yeah, and I've had fans come up to me at Gold's
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:47.320]   and they've all been cool, except, except.
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:49.000]   - Oh no. - Except.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.560]   - Except.
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:53.440]   - If I have my headphones on,
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:57.520]   and I'm doing deadlifts, I don't need you to come over,
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:02.040]   tap my ear, and start giving me critiques about my form.
[02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:03.680]   - This actually happened? - Yes.
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:06.520]   I'm still angry about it.
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:10.860]   I'm pulling my 150 in peace, thank you.
[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:13.240]   - Yeah, people are hilarious.
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:18.240]   I was recently in, actually the wildest day ever in my life.
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:21.680]   So many things happened in a row.
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:24.560]   So I went to a wedding in LA.
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:26.680]   - Andrew? - Andrew Schultz's.
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:31.400]   And with Whitney Cummings and Joe Rogan
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:33.560]   and a bunch of other fascinating people.
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:37.280]   It's just, speaking of weirdos, there's the comedian.
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:39.440]   The reason I find the comedians awesome,
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:42.680]   one, they're authentic, they're just cool people.
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:44.200]   But they're also just weird.
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:47.520]   You don't become a comedian for not being fucked up
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:49.440]   in all kinds of different interesting ways.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:51.320]   Anyway, so there's the wedding.
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:55.400]   I'm, you know me, it was only carbs at the wedding.
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:57.600]   So I didn't eat, I didn't eat for a long time.
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:02.600]   So I was already fasted 20 hours, 25 hours.
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:06.400]   So this whole story of everything that happens
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:11.400]   is Lex 40 hours fasted with Joe Rogan
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:13.640]   drinking a lot of whiskey.
[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:15.280]   And so-- - You were drinking too?
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:17.200]   - Oh, heavy. - On 40, oh my God,
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:18.800]   that's crazy. - So it is calories.
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:21.120]   That was my only source of calories, the whiskey.
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:24.760]   And I, so I didn't trust myself with carbs when I'm drunk.
[02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:27.600]   I just don't enjoy it 'cause I'll forget.
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:30.680]   And I just enjoy eating a strict, healthy diet
[02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:34.720]   when I'm drunk because I'd rather eat more food
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:37.040]   that's healthy versus not.
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:41.200]   And so anyway, so then we went to Vegas together.
[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:44.640]   And then just kept doing wild thing after,
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:46.280]   another wild thing.
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:48.600]   Rogan opened up for Wendy Cummings.
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:50.180]   He just showed up at a random party
[02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:52.600]   that he wasn't invited and he did a thing.
[02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:55.240]   He almost started a fight 'cause some guys said,
[02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:57.040]   stopped, yelled at him, said,
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:05:58.880]   "Stop spreading misinformation."
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:03.920]   And then we run into David Goggins.
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:05.800]   This is my first time meeting David Goggins.
[02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:08.600]   I've talked to David a lot over the phone
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:10.160]   and we were supposed to do a thing together.
[02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:12.920]   And this is me trashed out of my mind
[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:14.440]   meeting David for the first time
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:17.440]   with his incredible wife, Rogan's wife was there.
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:21.040]   By the way, Joe Rogan's wife, David's wife,
[02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:24.460]   made me realize that I really wanna be married
[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:27.300]   because they're not,
[02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:32.060]   they make their partners better.
[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:32.900]   - Yeah.
[02:06:32.900 --> 02:06:34.480]   - Like that, I was,
[02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:38.020]   there's a certain aspect of marriage
[02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:40.100]   that I'm afraid of that like your partner
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:41.540]   takes you away from life.
[02:06:41.540 --> 02:06:43.580]   You don't get to experience life as much.
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:47.260]   But this was like, they were enriching them.
[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:48.500]   I don't know, it was like
[02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:50.940]   the world's most powerful support group, it was cool.
[02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:53.120]   Anyway, so then of course, Drunk Lex
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:56.460]   is challenges Goggins to pushups.
[02:06:56.460 --> 02:06:58.020]   - I saw this on Instagram with everyone.
[02:06:58.020 --> 02:06:59.340]   - So we're in the middle of the--
[02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:00.620]   - And you in your suit.
[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:02.620]   - In the suit, in the middle of casino,
[02:07:02.620 --> 02:07:04.100]   there's a crowd gathering.
[02:07:04.100 --> 02:07:08.040]   It's Joe Rogan, me and David Goggins,
[02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:09.600]   and I'm just doing pushups with them.
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:12.560]   And Rogan is like commentating and yelling and screaming.
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:13.680]   It was surreal.
[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:16.340]   And just going on to the next thing and next thing
[02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:17.380]   and next thing like this.
[02:07:17.380 --> 02:07:22.380]   And then drove all the way from Vegas back to LA
[02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:25.900]   with Joe and Whitney and his wife.
[02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:28.280]   And it was like, what is this?
[02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:30.940]   And all of it is done in 24 hours.
[02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:34.500]   The one valuable lesson is don't fast and drink
[02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:37.260]   like excessively.
[02:07:37.260 --> 02:07:38.760]   So I've learned that.
[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:43.760]   Because what happens is liquor hits your mind, my mind,
[02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:46.220]   sorry, I'll speak about my particular mind.
[02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:49.860]   Like the intellectual part of my brain
[02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:51.960]   got hit really hard, really fast.
[02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:54.780]   So I was not able to even more so than usual
[02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:56.180]   stitch together sentences.
[02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:58.660]   I understood everyone really well.
[02:07:58.660 --> 02:08:00.460]   - So like major and immigrant again.
[02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:03.780]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:06.300]   - So like meeting David, I wanna say so many things.
[02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:08.120]   He's so inspiring to me, right?
[02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:10.220]   But all I said was like, hello.
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:16.180]   And I remember opening my mouth to try to say more
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:19.740]   and I was like, and then I would just close my mouth
[02:08:19.740 --> 02:08:21.300]   and not be able to say anymore.
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:24.180]   - This is one of the reasons I don't drink ever.
[02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:28.580]   - It removes certain barriers.
[02:08:28.580 --> 02:08:30.780]   Like it allows you to maybe have fun
[02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:31.860]   that you wouldn't otherwise.
[02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:34.580]   But yeah, definitely for a person who values
[02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:37.700]   intellectual eloquence.
[02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:39.420]   - But I also hate being hungover.
[02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:40.260]   - The hungover part, yeah.
[02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:41.100]   - That's the worst.
[02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:41.940]   - Yeah, it's the worst.
[02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:43.900]   - I feel like I did this to myself.
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:45.340]   - Yeah.
[02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:48.700]   But it also teaches me that this too shall pass
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:51.420]   because I've been hungover and I've quit drinking
[02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:55.000]   so many times in my life that it makes you realize
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.340]   that all the unpleasant feelings,
[02:08:57.340 --> 02:08:59.500]   all you have to do is just wait it out and be fine.
[02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:02.860]   - It took me a long time to realize that that expression
[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:04.540]   means the other thing.
[02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:05.380]   - What's the other thing?
[02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:08.100]   - If things are going great, this too shall pass.
[02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:08.940]   - Yeah.
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:09.900]   - I always thought about it. - Life of suffering.
[02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:11.540]   - No, I always thought about it as being more like,
[02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:12.900]   don't worry if things are bad, it'll pass.
[02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:15.100]   It's also like if something's going great,
[02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:17.100]   it's not gonna be this way forever.
[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:19.300]   - It's like Bukowski said, "Love is a fog
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:22.020]   "that fades with the first daylight of reality."
[02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:25.220]   (inhales and exhales)
[02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:26.780]   Do you think love can last?
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:28.180]   - Oh yeah, we're gonna win.
[02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:30.140]   - Who's we?
[02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:30.980]   - The good guys.
[02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:34.900]   - Didn't Hitler also think he was the good guys?
[02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:36.100]   - He was wrong.
[02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:36.940]   (laughs)
[02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:37.980]   'Cause you know why?
[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:38.820]   - Why?
[02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:39.640]   - He didn't win.
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:41.680]   (laughs)
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:43.160]   - So you think it's permanent.
[02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:47.240]   So this one time, the good guy's winning, it'll last.
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:48.720]   It won't pass.
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:53.080]   'Cause I think all of it passes, unfortunately.
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:56.920]   - I think we're going to win and win big
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:09:58.480]   in the not so distant future.
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:02.280]   - Do you have specific things in mind or no?
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:04.800]   Or just a sense about human civilization,
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:07.520]   about society waking up?
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:08.760]   - I don't know about waking up,
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:13.760]   but I think the increased understanding
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:17.260]   on all sides of the political spectrum
[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:22.200]   that corporate America and corporate news outlets
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:25.120]   are self-motivated actors,
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:28.520]   and those motivations are often inimical
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:31.600]   to what others would regard as desirable,
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:33.120]   is something that I think is happening
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:35.080]   with increasing frequency.
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:39.640]   - So what do you think about the political landscape
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:40.480]   in general?
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:42.320]   You had a great conversation with Glenn Beck,
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:45.240]   and he said that he talked to Trump
[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:49.800]   and believes that Donald Trump is definitely running in 2024
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:52.240]   or very likely running in 2024.
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:54.360]   I think he said he thinks he'll have a good chance
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:57.940]   of winning, or I don't remember that.
[02:10:57.940 --> 02:11:01.120]   But the fact that he was running was a surprise to you.
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:05.120]   Do you think Donald Trump would be running in 2024?
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:10.120]   - Given that Glenn Beck has a much better relationship
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:12.760]   with Trump than I do, to put it mildly,
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:14.920]   if Glenn Beck is certain this is gonna happen,
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:17.120]   I would defer to Glenn Beck's judgment.
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:19.400]   - Do you think he has a chance of winning?
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:20.360]   Do you think he'll win?
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.440]   - Anyone in a binary political system
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:23.640]   who's the nominee has a chance.
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:26.300]   Like whoever the Republican, Democrat, has a chance.
[02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:29.780]   I think also it's a lot easier to vote for someone
[02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:31.920]   that you have voted for in the past.
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:33.840]   So that's why incumbents have a big advantage.
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:36.040]   It's not that psychological barrier to cover.
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:38.600]   I think it's also useful for Trump
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:40.640]   that he's banished from social media
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:44.400]   because then he doesn't have to have the responsibility
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:47.680]   of governing and all the costs of that.
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:49.600]   'Cause no matter what decisions you make while governing,
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:51.600]   some people aren't gonna like that.
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:54.560]   So he gets to kind of be above the radar
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:57.360]   or below the radar rather to some extent.
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:59.440]   I don't think it's at all a given
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:01.800]   that he would get the nomination.
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:03.360]   When I say the good guys are gonna win,
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:05.640]   I certainly don't mean Donald Trump.
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:08.080]   I don't think victory is gonna come
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:10.120]   as a consequence of Washington.
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:12.760]   - Do you wanna make America great again?
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:14.120]   - I think America is great.
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:18.920]   - This is my failed attempt at humor.
[02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:20.320]   - One of many.
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:23.080]   There are also hats that Giuliani and Jim Jeffords wore
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:25.280]   that said, people can look this up,
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:27.560]   they said, 'cause they were south of the border,
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:30.280]   make Mexico great again also.
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:32.520]   (laughing)
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:36.240]   Like that to me, it was like,
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:37.880]   it's like, mwah.
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:39.440]   Like just the syntax there.
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:42.040]   - Okay.
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:47.520]   So you don't even think he might get the nomination.
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:48.880]   If you, who else might?
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:53.640]   - I mean, if you had asked two years, three years out
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:55.320]   who the nominee in 2020 would be,
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:58.080]   Donald Trump wasn't even, or 2016 rather,
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:12:59.720]   wasn't even on the radar screen.
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:01.960]   So we have a long way to go.
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:04.080]   - Even two years is a long way to go?
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:05.520]   - Yeah.
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:07.680]   Especially 'cause we're coming out of COVID,
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:08.880]   there might be some governor
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.520]   who becomes a rockstar for some reason.
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:11.920]   Maybe someone's gonna have some moment,
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:14.600]   some congressman might have some big moment
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:16.480]   where they're screaming at somebody
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:18.720]   and all of a sudden they become a rockstar
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:19.960]   in the Republican Party.
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:23.840]   - Or could be one of the celebrities we don't think about.
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:26.000]   I mean, Donald Trump is essentially
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.440]   not a political figure before he ran.
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:31.000]   So it could be any of the famous,
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:36.000]   right-leaning celebrities.
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:40.600]   I don't even know which way McConaughey leans.
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:41.760]   - No, I think he's a lefty,
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:44.040]   or he was gonna run as a Democrat, but he's not running.
[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:46.800]   - But people like that just might step into the ring.
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:48.800]   - Yeah, I don't think they'd have that much of a chance
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:52.080]   'cause I think the Republican Party, there's an asymmetry.
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:54.640]   They'd be much more skeptical of an actor
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:55.600]   than the Democrats would be
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:57.960]   because they would regard that actor as coming
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:00.840]   as a kind of mentoring candidate or whatever.
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:02.520]   - Right, but there's other kinds of celebrities,
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:04.920]   like Jocko could run as a Republican.
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:06.600]   - That's a good example, yeah, yeah.
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:08.960]   - That would be interesting, so a military person.
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:10.400]   - Right, yeah.
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:13.360]   But already, for example, Dr. Oz is thinking
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:15.600]   of running for, is going to run for the Senate
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:19.000]   in Pennsylvania, and there's already been a lot of research,
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.200]   people slamming him on Twitter and social media
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:23.640]   for past positions he's taken.
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:28.560]   DeSantis is the figure of the moment,
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:30.200]   but Scott Walker was the figure of the moment
[02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:32.900]   in the 2016 cycle, and he didn't even make it to Iowa.
[02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:37.960]   - Yeah, and I wonder what role does COVID play
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:40.140]   in all of this in terms of,
[02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:46.360]   I'm mostly optimistic and hopeful about the world.
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:49.560]   When I look at the world, I'm excited by most things.
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:52.500]   I've been a little bit or a lot disappointed
[02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:56.400]   by the lack of great leadership in a time of trouble
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:00.440]   'cause to me, one of the great things
[02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:05.440]   about a difficult time is it brings out the great leaders.
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:09.200]   Again, it's the up and down things,
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:10.640]   like you don't wanna ask for war,
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:13.320]   you don't wanna ask for pandemics,
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:17.500]   but when they happen, it's a great opportunity
[02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:19.080]   for the human spirit to flourish,
[02:15:19.080 --> 02:15:21.200]   and the fact that it didn't quite in the way
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:24.360]   that I hoped it would is disappointing.
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:25.680]   I think there's still time, too,
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:29.320]   'cause people are trying to figure out what to do
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:30.800]   as we emerge from the fog.
[02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:34.640]   So I'm excited by 2020.
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:38.240]   For somebody said this dark, cynical thing,
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:42.000]   I hope this is not true, but that there was some doubt
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.400]   about the results of the election in 2020
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:48.640]   that in 2024, both sides,
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:52.360]   it'll just start becoming standard
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:57.040]   to completely reject the results of an election
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:15:58.160]   no matter who wins.
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:15:59.560]   - Well, that's my perspective.
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:02.320]   I don't regard elections as legitimate,
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:04.480]   and I see what you're saying, not in the terms of,
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:06.200]   basically, the process itself was illegitimate.
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:08.080]   - Yes, so there's cheating or something.
[02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:12.040]   - Yeah, but I think that that's pretty much a given.
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:13.600]   It has been a given.
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:14.760]   The Republicans often say,
[02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:17.440]   "Oh, they got all these illegals to vote,"
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:18.280]   or the Democrats will say,
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:19.440]   "The voting machines were hacked,"
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:22.080]   or the media, so on and so forth,
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:24.320]   because despite all the people
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:26.400]   flapping their gums about democracy,
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:27.520]   they only like democracy
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:29.820]   when it gives them the results that they want.
[02:16:29.820 --> 02:16:32.760]   - Can I ask you about something else that Glenn Beck said
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:34.280]   that I thought was really interesting?
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:36.160]   I agree with him very much on this.
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.880]   And it was refreshing to hear,
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:41.000]   although he kind of made it,
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:44.000]   turned it into a point about why Trump is great or whatever,
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.680]   but the point was the following,
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:49.800]   which is he doesn't want to talk to anybody
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:54.400]   who can't say at least one nice thing about everyone.
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:56.920]   So if you don't like Donald Trump,
[02:16:56.920 --> 02:16:58.400]   if you don't like Joe Biden,
[02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:01.520]   you should still be able to say one nice thing,
[02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:03.200]   like legitimate, nice,
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:05.000]   not just a dismissive nice thing,
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.800]   but legitimately say what is one nice thing they did
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:12.040]   or who they are as a person,
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:17.000]   not like saying Donald Trump is funny sometimes,
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.680]   like no, legitimate, where you really mean it.
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:21.560]   And it's been really troubling to me
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:25.080]   how few people are able to do that about political figures.
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:26.480]   I had a lot of people,
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:29.960]   I think I tweeted something like this
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:31.560]   leading up to the election,
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:34.760]   saying like, you should be able to say something nice
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:37.640]   about both Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:41.160]   And I've had old friends,
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:45.840]   I don't want to say specific, I guess, to call them out,
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:48.200]   but several people,
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:50.720]   one in particular wrote me this long,
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:52.320]   several page email.
[02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:53.400]   - It was Sam?
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:54.240]   - It was Sam Harris.
[02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:55.080]   - Was it Sam Harris?
[02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:56.440]   - Sam Harris.
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:57.280]   No.
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:01.960]   I have a lot of conversations with Sam Harris now
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:03.320]   and Joe on both sides.
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:06.000]   It's like the devil and the angel on both my,
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:07.480]   I don't know which one is which, but.
[02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:08.960]   - Joe's the angel.
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:10.240]   - They're both devils.
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:13.280]   - Different kinds of devils, yeah, that's fair.
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:15.800]   - And they said, how could you say,
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:17.720]   how could you even consider
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:21.480]   that there's something positive about Donald Trump?
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:23.480]   - Yeah, here's an easy one.
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:26.800]   He has three wives with three kids with each,
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:28.600]   but the kids get along.
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:30.400]   I think that's really commendable
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:33.240]   that Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and Barron
[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:34.720]   can all get along with each other,
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:35.760]   given the circumstances.
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:39.800]   I think that speaks to someone as a father, Ivanka.
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:41.160]   - So on the family level,
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:44.200]   and I see the same thing with actually,
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:48.240]   one of the reasons I always found Joe Biden fascinating
[02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:51.320]   is he's had a lot of really traumatic things
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:52.160]   happen in his life.
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:53.160]   - Yeah.
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:54.040]   - And--
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:55.560]   - If I shit my pants in front of the Pope,
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:56.720]   I'd be traumatized too.
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:00.600]   - I'm talking to a master troll
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:02.720]   about something sensitive and beautiful
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:05.120]   that is a man suffering with a loss.
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:06.520]   - I kinda know what he feels like right now.
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:07.920]   I'm pretending to the Pope.
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:10.780]   This chair's ruined.
[02:19:10.780 --> 02:19:13.000]   Sorry, Elon.
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:14.480]   (laughing)
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:16.440]   You're gonna have to sit in it.
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:18.440]   - Well, why does this chair feel
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:20.600]   kinda like I'm sitting in a swamp?
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:25.600]   Look, you have stuff to show, can't you afford a chair?
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:26.880]   I'll send you one for Tesla.
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:28.800]   - That's a pretty good Elon impression.
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:33.620]   But yeah, I mean, like one criticism I tell Joe,
[02:19:33.620 --> 02:19:38.360]   Rogan is like, he has trouble finding
[02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:41.160]   one positive thing to say about Joe Biden, for example.
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:43.680]   And I just don't like that.
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:47.440]   I think, I mean, I'm a big believer
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:50.320]   in the shit sandwich, sticking on topics.
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:51.160]   - Here's an easy one.
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:54.460]   I think Joe Biden clearly is a very amiable person.
[02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:55.300]   - What's amiable?
[02:19:55.300 --> 02:19:56.520]   - He gets along with people.
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:59.080]   Like it seems really clear that maybe before president,
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:00.520]   'cause it's different when you're the president,
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:02.320]   but that he could call a lot of these Republican senators,
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:04.600]   get them on the phone and have a conversation with them.
[02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:06.480]   - Yeah, and it's not some kind of manipulation.
[02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:08.400]   - To some extent it is, 'cause they're all politicians.
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:11.440]   But he clearly seemed to be able to get,
[02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:13.800]   wasn't like an ideologue.
[02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:14.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:17.460]   I mean, but there's, I mean, maybe I'm a sucker
[02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:19.940]   for that kind of thing, but the blue collar thing,
[02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:22.040]   like riding the train, you know,
[02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:24.920]   there's ways to connect with people and not,
[02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:26.960]   it's seeing them as equals,
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:28.800]   no matter where their walks of life are.
[02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:30.700]   And I love it when presidents do that.
[02:20:30.700 --> 02:20:35.360]   To some degree, because of the wealth
[02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:37.080]   under which Donald Trump existed
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:38.840]   for a lot of his recent life,
[02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:41.640]   he's less able to do that quite naturally.
[02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:45.280]   Maybe sometimes Obama wasn't quite able to do that.
[02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:46.240]   - That's a good question.
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:48.320]   Who's more blue collar, Trump or Biden?
[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:51.200]   And you can easily make the case for both, I think.
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:52.120]   - You could.
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:56.080]   Not the blue collar, but like literally be able to fit in
[02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:59.000]   at a bar, at a local bar and just like--
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:00.040]   - I can see both of them.
[02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:00.880]   - Yeah, you're right.
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:01.720]   I could see both of them.
[02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:02.540]   - Yeah.
[02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:04.000]   - In fact, Obama doesn't quite.
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.400]   - No, 'cause he's got that Ivy League thing.
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:06.240]   - Yeah, the Ivy League thing.
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:07.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:09.680]   - Yeah, you're right.
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:12.200]   Somehow Donald Trump can too.
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:13.040]   - No, easily, yeah.
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:14.080]   You can see him having a beer with the guys
[02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:15.040]   and yelling at the screen,
[02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:18.240]   "This is bullshit, change the channel."
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:20.240]   - Yeah, I hope people do that.
[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:23.680]   I think that's one of the most unpleasant things to me
[02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:28.680]   is they're not able to empathize with the fact
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:31.000]   that half the country voted for another person.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.040]   - Well, it's also then, it's just a bad strategy.
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:35.640]   If you can't figure out why half the country
[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:37.920]   is voting for someone you guard as like a demon,
[02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:40.040]   well then how are you gonna supposed to fight this demon?
[02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:42.800]   Like when I did your reader, the North Korea book,
[02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:45.520]   it's like don't you wanna understand
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:48.760]   how these people get to where they got?
[02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:50.280]   And no one's saying that he's a good person,
[02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:51.800]   but like there's a logic to their,
[02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:53.880]   there's a method to their madness.
[02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:56.360]   - You've talked about national divorce a few times.
[02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:58.560]   I've seen a couple of videos recently
[02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:00.960]   where you're responding to articles.
[02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:01.840]   It's kinda cool.
[02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:07.440]   Can you talk about this idea of national divorce
[02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:11.120]   and as it stands today, arguing for it maybe?
[02:22:11.120 --> 02:22:14.040]   And if you could, just out of curiosity
[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:15.280]   in the context of those videos,
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:18.600]   if you can steal men and argument against national divorce.
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:21.280]   - So I was the first one to kind of bring this issue
[02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:24.800]   back into the national conversation.
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:27.200]   I wrote a piece for Observer in 2016.
[02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:29.920]   Then Jesse Kelly had a piece a few months after that.
[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:32.320]   Dave Urboy just recently did a piece
[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:34.680]   on his dub stack earlier this year.
[02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:38.200]   And it's become enough of a mainstreamed idea
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:41.280]   that paleontology outlets like the National Review
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:43.120]   have felt the need to respond to them.
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:45.560]   So the point being that America has had
[02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:47.880]   at least two cultures since the beginning
[02:22:47.880 --> 02:22:49.760]   and that there's absolutely no reason,
[02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:51.680]   and these cultures in recent years,
[02:22:51.680 --> 02:22:54.400]   and this was in 2016, not mentioned 2021,
[02:22:54.400 --> 02:22:56.680]   have been increasingly antagonistic toward one another
[02:22:56.680 --> 02:23:00.120]   and have even lost the ability to communicate.
[02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:02.040]   They're using language in different ways
[02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:05.360]   and that there's no reason for this to continue any further.
[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:10.280]   And just, you live your life, we'll live ours
[02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:14.640]   and goodbye and good luck, no ill will.
[02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:18.040]   Now there's lots of arguments against them.
[02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:21.480]   Some of those are completely, I think, stupid.
[02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:24.840]   The stupidest one is, well, that's what China wants.
[02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:28.400]   - Okay, well, I mean, I'm not going to live my life saying,
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:30.400]   I'm just gonna do the opposite of whatever China wants.
[02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:34.200]   That's not logic, that's not a good pathway.
[02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:35.560]   Now, I'm not saying they're right or wrong,
[02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:37.240]   but that's not a reason one way or another.
[02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:39.480]   - Yeah, you bring up China or Russia,
[02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:42.200]   that's exactly what China or Russia want.
[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:44.720]   But sort of the strong way to phrase that
[02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:50.760]   is it weakens America,
[02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:55.280]   like not just the one America,
[02:23:55.280 --> 02:24:00.280]   but like both sides in the divorce will be much weaker
[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:03.640]   than they individually were together.
[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:04.680]   So in that sense,
[02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:07.380]   not that you have to care about what China thinks,
[02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:11.000]   but like it's a big step backwards.
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:12.400]   - Yes, I think in the short term,
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:14.920]   it is absolutely a big step backwards in terms of power.
[02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:16.960]   There's no question that,
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:18.680]   when you're trying to reestablish a society,
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:20.200]   there's gonna be a transition period.
[02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:22.320]   That transition period is gonna be costly.
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:24.240]   Each side starts wondering, wait a minute,
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:25.340]   why are we still doing this?
[02:24:25.340 --> 02:24:26.760]   We don't have to anymore, we're not living with them,
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:27.720]   so on and so forth.
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:29.820]   So that's gonna be a concern.
[02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:34.360]   I don't think that the whole point of America
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:36.680]   or even a large primary point of America
[02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:38.960]   is to be a bulwark against Chinese power.
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:42.040]   And there's gonna be very few people on earth,
[02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:45.960]   given my work, who have as much informed hatred
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:49.160]   and contempt for the Chinese government as I do.
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:52.760]   Certainly, next to the North Korean people,
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:55.240]   maybe the people from Eritrea,
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:57.640]   there's few populations who I'm as worried about
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:00.600]   as the people under the rule of the Red Chinese.
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:02.680]   My steel man argument is,
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:04.560]   there's no way this is gonna be peaceful,
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:06.680]   'cause the lines don't separate out well.
[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:10.300]   So all you're doing is basically just replicating the problem
[02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:12.760]   because the disparity isn't between,
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:14.120]   like during the Civil War, North and South,
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:16.880]   it's like it's between New York City and upstate New York,
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:19.480]   or between Chicago, downstate Chicago.
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:22.880]   Once you get outside of LA and Sacramento,
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:24.920]   California in many ways is like Kentucky,
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:26.600]   so it doesn't make sense.
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:28.040]   So that's a strong argument.
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:29.080]   - Yeah, I mean, you've talked about
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:30.960]   that this process will be painful.
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:31.800]   - Right. - It can be painful.
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:33.880]   And we're not just talking about violence.
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:36.120]   It could be just, even the Civil War,
[02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:39.480]   you could divide it somewhat cleanly.
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:41.620]   Obviously, the kind of national divorce
[02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:43.800]   you might be suggesting is,
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:45.360]   yeah, people are living amongst each other,
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:47.880]   so you have to literally move, it's complicated.
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:50.520]   - Right, so that is a very strong argument.
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:52.940]   I think a cogent argument against it.
[02:25:52.940 --> 02:25:55.680]   Two is, it's not just China,
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:59.400]   it's that there's a lot of bad actors in the world
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:01.400]   who maybe aren't, like China certainly wants
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:03.240]   to carry itself and have an appearance,
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:07.400]   at least on the world stage, as civilized and a leader.
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:11.140]   There's lots of smaller countries who, without us,
[02:26:11.140 --> 02:26:14.300]   are gonna feel comfortable doing some very nefarious things.
[02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:16.720]   And they're not gonna be scared of us anymore.
[02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:18.400]   And so that would be a bigger concern
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:19.480]   in many regards than China.
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:21.860]   So I think that's a reasonable one.
[02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:25.140]   It could be that both sides, if this happens,
[02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:28.160]   are gonna, instead of work toward better,
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:30.400]   the things that make each side bad would get worse.
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:31.840]   - Yeah. - And that's, you know,
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:34.520]   having those push towards the malevolent extremes
[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:37.600]   is, I think, a very legitimate criticism and a concern.
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:38.880]   - I mean, as you suggested,
[02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:40.600]   there's no guarantee that won't happen.
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:42.200]   - Correct, at all.
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:45.580]   Also, there's, I think, a reasonable argument to make
[02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:48.820]   is like, are you, America, just as a symbol
[02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:50.460]   and the myth of America, and I don't mean myth
[02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:53.500]   in a negative sense, do you really wanna throw
[02:26:53.500 --> 02:26:54.700]   that in the garbage?
[02:26:54.700 --> 02:26:56.540]   Like, this meant a lot for a lot of people
[02:26:56.540 --> 02:26:57.760]   and a lot for history.
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:27:00.820]   You're just gonna be like, okay, good work.
[02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:02.360]   We're done here, let's shut the lights.
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:04.240]   So that's, I think, a reasonable argument.
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:09.240]   So those are the biggest ones, I would say.
[02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:13.320]   - And still, what is the case for national divorce
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:15.640]   and along which lines?
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:20.480]   So like, in making the case for national divorce,
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:24.140]   if it is desired, based on which kind of ideas
[02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:26.920]   do you think it should be carried through?
[02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:29.480]   - Honestly, I don't know that it has to be idea-based.
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:32.480]   Like, for example, when Czechoslovakia broke up,
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:35.200]   when Norway and Sweden broke up,
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:37.680]   it wasn't really ideological.
[02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:39.080]   It was more cultural.
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:43.320]   So I always say divorce into two,
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:46.360]   but it would probably make more sense if it was like five,
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:48.560]   because the Northeast, certainly New England,
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:50.100]   has their own culture.
[02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:53.040]   The West Coast has their own kind of culture.
[02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:58.040]   I don't know, the thing is, any kind of persuasion technique,
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:00.820]   right, like, once people are start,
[02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:03.880]   there's a difference between convincing someone
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:06.420]   they wanna buy a car and what features you want.
[02:28:06.420 --> 02:28:07.760]   So if you're at the point where we're arguing
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:09.320]   about the features, then my work here is done.
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:10.160]   Do you know what I mean?
[02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:11.740]   Like, I don't have a dog in the fight
[02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:12.960]   in terms of what it's gonna look like.
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:13.960]   I just wanna get to the point
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:16.040]   where you're at least considering seriously
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:18.040]   the idea of breaking up America.
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:19.840]   And I would encourage people to go look at my article
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:23.260]   to see, which I'm sure the arguments still hold,
[02:28:23.260 --> 02:28:24.320]   five years later.
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:28.040]   - Do you have a kind of vision of which of the two
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:29.560]   or which of the five,
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:35.120]   like, do you actually have specific cultures or ideas?
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:36.040]   - I'll tell you exactly.
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:36.880]   - Yeah.
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:40.840]   - If I told you and everyone listening in 2014,
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:43.360]   we weren't that long ago, it was not long ago,
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:46.200]   which of these two things is more likely to happen?
[02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:51.200]   2014, Texas secedes or declares secession from America
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:53.560]   or Donald Trump gets elected president.
[02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:56.960]   Everyone's voting for Texas, like, in terms of prediction,
[02:28:56.960 --> 02:28:58.120]   which is more likely?
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:28:59.360]   So we had this one.
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:01.480]   So it's not at all unlikely we're gonna have this one.
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:03.280]   - I don't know if that logic carries through.
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:07.440]   You can't just say, "Here's an unlikely thing that happened,
[02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:09.480]   "therefore, anything can happen."
[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:10.920]   - I just said, you just earlier said anything
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:12.560]   could happen this episode, didn't you?
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:13.440]   - Life is suffering.
[02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:15.600]   I wasn't listening to half the things you're saying.
[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:16.680]   - You said it!
[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:17.500]   - I said it?
[02:29:17.500 --> 02:29:18.480]   - Yes, you said anything could happen.
[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:20.960]   - I'm definitely not, I'm like you with podcasts.
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:23.320]   I do a podcast, but I don't listen to it.
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:24.160]   - It's 'cause I'm talking.
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:25.320]   - That's why I'm talking.
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:29.120]   Okay, so yeah, yeah, it can happen, but in which,
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:31.000]   I guess I'm asking, would you stay in Texas?
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:31.840]   - 100%.
[02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:34.440]   - And I'd run for office probably, it'd be fun.
[02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:38.040]   I'm gonna be the first president of Texas.
[02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:41.240]   - I attended a debate between Yoram Brooks
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:45.760]   and Yoram Hazony, I don't know if you know who that is.
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:46.880]   - The nationalist guy.
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:49.440]   - Yeah, he wrote a book called "The Virtue of Nationalism."
[02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:50.760]   - Yeah, I read that book.
[02:29:50.760 --> 02:29:52.440]   - And they actually did a podcast with him,
[02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:54.080]   they did a debate.
[02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:55.440]   - Oh, they both run here?
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:56.280]   Okay.
[02:29:56.280 --> 02:29:57.560]   - It was quite interesting,
[02:29:57.560 --> 02:29:59.940]   and I tried to wear my Michael Malice hat.
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:02.560]   - You're wearing it now.
[02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:05.000]   You borrowed that from me.
[02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:05.840]   - Yeah.
[02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:10.200]   It's funny, 'cause the metaphor applies
[02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:14.200]   across all of these level of collectivism.
[02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:17.800]   So he was arguing for the power of nation,
[02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:20.660]   so he would be arguing against national divorce,
[02:30:20.660 --> 02:30:23.440]   but he was also arguing for marriage,
[02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:26.680]   the power of actual marriage between individuals.
[02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:30.160]   I think he's a conservative,
[02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:32.200]   and what I really like about him is
[02:30:32.200 --> 02:30:35.160]   there's a clear philosophy of conservatism
[02:30:35.160 --> 02:30:37.460]   that he expresses, and I think a lot of people
[02:30:37.460 --> 02:30:42.040]   get behind that philosophy, 'cause to me,
[02:30:42.040 --> 02:30:46.920]   conservatism and liberalism often is very used loosely.
[02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:49.800]   He has a clear philosophy that he's expressing there,
[02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:51.520]   and it's grounded in tradition.
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:53.760]   He has a lot of value in tradition,
[02:30:53.760 --> 02:30:57.280]   and so it's the thing you said about America,
[02:30:57.280 --> 02:31:00.540]   like one of the arguments against national divorce
[02:31:00.540 --> 02:31:05.480]   is like, listen, we've been at it for a while.
[02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:07.640]   There is a lot of value in the fact
[02:31:07.640 --> 02:31:09.080]   that we've been at it for a while.
[02:31:09.080 --> 02:31:11.040]   Don't just throw it all away all the time.
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:13.520]   So he says philosophically, he seems,
[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:18.520]   in a lot of walks of life, revolution should be avoided
[02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:20.240]   as much as possible.
[02:31:20.240 --> 02:31:21.080]   - I agree.
[02:31:21.080 --> 02:31:23.800]   - And so it's kind of interesting.
[02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:25.720]   So he makes the case that there's something
[02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:29.200]   fundamentally powerful about the nation,
[02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:34.200]   that it's a nice way to group a culture,
[02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:39.640]   and so the national divorce, I guess, goes against that.
[02:31:39.640 --> 02:31:43.000]   Do you find some aspect of the virtue of nationalism,
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.300]   as you would put it, powerful?
[02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:49.160]   - Well, powerful in a good sense?
[02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:51.840]   - In a good sense, so sorry, yeah, in a good sense.
[02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:53.640]   It brings out the best in humans.
[02:31:53.640 --> 02:31:54.480]   - I don't know about the best,
[02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:55.800]   but it certainly brings out good things.
[02:31:55.800 --> 02:31:58.080]   I have that line I always say about I love my country.
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:31:59.800]   I hate the government because I love my country.
[02:31:59.800 --> 02:32:02.240]   - Yeah, so there is a love of country.
[02:32:02.240 --> 02:32:04.480]   - I think it's, but I don't know that that's the,
[02:32:04.480 --> 02:32:07.280]   I think it's also the case
[02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:09.360]   because the country happens to be America.
[02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:12.280]   Like, I don't know if I was living in, you know,
[02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:14.720]   whatever, I don't wanna insult someone's country.
[02:32:14.720 --> 02:32:17.560]   Canada, yeah, if I was living in Canada,
[02:32:17.560 --> 02:32:18.400]   I don't know that it'd be the ultra patriot.
[02:32:18.400 --> 02:32:20.080]   - This is a guy who calls basically
[02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:22.120]   every other country shithole country.
[02:32:22.120 --> 02:32:24.320]   - Yeah, that's true, that's the fact.
[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:26.360]   - Yeah, so it's either, you're either,
[02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:29.560]   there's two types of countries, Texas or shitholes.
[02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:31.400]   - Oh, wow, you went full Texas.
[02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:34.240]   So you're okay burning the Northeast
[02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:35.880]   to the ground at this point.
[02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:37.280]   - Okay, I'm hoping for it.
[02:32:37.280 --> 02:32:38.720]   - I'm hoping.
[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:40.520]   - What they've done to New York City,
[02:32:40.520 --> 02:32:42.840]   I will never forgive these people.
[02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:46.480]   And I hope that they suffer enormously consequences
[02:32:46.480 --> 02:32:48.720]   for what they've done to New York.
[02:32:48.720 --> 02:32:52.720]   It's unforgettable, the assault that they've done
[02:32:52.720 --> 02:32:56.560]   and had no remorse over how many creative outlets
[02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:57.520]   that they've destroyed.
[02:32:57.520 --> 02:32:58.600]   - Yeah, it's the cultural hub,
[02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:01.200]   cultural center of the world in many ways.
[02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:03.840]   - New York was the, this was the place
[02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:05.680]   where you go to put up your shingle
[02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:09.400]   and move the needle and make things happen.
[02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:11.520]   And I would understand if it was like,
[02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:13.680]   okay, we gotta suffer through this for a year,
[02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:16.440]   but we're gonna make sure all these businesses
[02:33:16.440 --> 02:33:19.120]   have a kind of safety net to make sure
[02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:21.680]   that they kind of get through and survive this,
[02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:24.520]   which they did to the banks in 2008, for example.
[02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:26.200]   And I'm saying this as an anarchist
[02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:27.320]   and there was none of that.
[02:33:27.320 --> 02:33:31.400]   So I burn it down and salt the earth.
[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:34.560]   'Cause it's like watching like a zombie.
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:38.040]   It's unnatural, it's an abomination.
[02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:41.200]   - So I mean, sort of on the white pill side of things,
[02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:42.960]   I don't know about you, maybe,
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:45.640]   I have a sense that both Silicon Valley,
[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:47.280]   that for me personally,
[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:49.200]   maybe I have the same intensity of feeling
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:51.160]   as you do about New York.
[02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:54.920]   It's just disappointing to see it be consumed
[02:33:54.920 --> 02:33:58.480]   with cynicism and a lot of other paralyzing forces,
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:00.640]   but I still have hope for that place.
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:05.640]   I think maybe it's the Yoram kind of tradition hope
[02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:12.280]   that through momentum, the strong reemerges.
[02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:14.600]   So like I have hope for New York.
[02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:17.080]   I think New York will continue,
[02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:20.040]   like not maybe on a scale of years,
[02:34:20.040 --> 02:34:21.840]   but on a scale of decades,
[02:34:21.840 --> 02:34:24.160]   it'd be ups and downs where it reemerges
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:25.840]   as a cultural center.
[02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:28.360]   I just can't imagine a place like New York,
[02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:30.080]   it's like Paris.
[02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:33.080]   There's going to be long stretches of time
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:35.000]   where it leads the world.
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.400]   - Paris has not been a cultural hub for a very long time.
[02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:39.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:42.120]   - You know, the days of Matisse and Picasso
[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:44.160]   and Gertrude Stein are long gone.
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:48.520]   - It still is a hub.
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:50.120]   - Even London isn't London.
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:50.960]   - Yeah.
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:53.400]   But what is then?
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:54.800]   London is still London.
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:55.880]   Paris is still Paris.
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:57.680]   It's just not the Paris of old.
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:34:58.920]   It's not London of old.
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:01.120]   London is still a place.
[02:35:01.120 --> 02:35:02.680]   It's a tech hub.
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:03.840]   It's a fashion hub.
[02:35:03.840 --> 02:35:05.240]   It's a music hub.
[02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:07.120]   I mean, it's still a pretty strong hub.
[02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:09.600]   - Yeah, but not like during the Beatles era.
[02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:10.440]   - Right.
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:11.960]   - Or during the Sex Pistols era.
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:15.360]   - But it could be just us romanticizing the past.
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:16.520]   'Cause what is a hub then?
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:18.880]   - No, it's not romanticizing the past
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:22.480]   because a hub is the place where everyone on earth
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:24.120]   or our eyes are on you.
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:26.640]   So in the late '60s, in the mid '60s,
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:28.040]   you see the British invasion,
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:29.560]   you know, the Kinks and all these other bands
[02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:32.040]   coming out of Great Britain,
[02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:33.320]   like they were the innovators.
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:35.840]   This was the place that was happening.
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:37.200]   - Well, in that sense like--
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:39.200]   - And Brooklyn, you know, 15 years ago.
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:43.880]   - But I guess maybe in that sense,
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:46.920]   in the 21st century, geographical hubs
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:48.120]   are becoming a thing of the past.
[02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:51.920]   So like you can be a hub in the digital space now.
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:55.040]   So like it's not, maybe you'll never have--
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:57.340]   - I don't think, I think there will always be,
[02:35:57.340 --> 02:36:00.960]   I mean, what I'm saying, digital space makes it easier
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:03.560]   for let's suppose Cleveland to be a hub.
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:04.400]   - Right.
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:05.240]   - Because all you need are like 10 people
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:06.480]   who happen to live in Cleveland.
[02:36:06.480 --> 02:36:08.520]   Or you know, Akron was a hub, a minor hub.
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:12.000]   - All it takes is 10 to 50 people to create a, yeah.
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:12.900]   And maybe even less.
[02:36:12.900 --> 02:36:16.080]   Maybe it's just two or three or four people.
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:17.940]   - I mean, there's been no shortage of articles
[02:36:17.940 --> 02:36:20.720]   talking about Austin and what's happening here.
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:23.280]   And I know some of Joe's plans and you and I
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:26.080]   and Blair and all these other people that we know.
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:27.280]   Buddy Andrew Heaton moved here.
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:29.280]   He's just one of the best people I know.
[02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:31.640]   It's just, I'm really, really excited.
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:33.960]   - Can I ask you some weird thing about friendship?
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:34.800]   - Of course.
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:38.700]   - 'Cause you mentioned Sam, he's Mr. Harris to you.
[02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:43.100]   Didn't that bother you how he went after Joe?
[02:36:43.100 --> 02:36:43.940]   - What did he say?
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:45.660]   - He's like, oh, in case you guys have brain damage
[02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:47.380]   from watching Rogan's last episode,
[02:36:47.380 --> 02:36:48.660]   like watch, here's the answer.
[02:36:48.660 --> 02:36:49.500]   And it's just like--
[02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:50.320]   - Oh, like digs like that.
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:51.420]   - Yeah, yeah, I didn't like that.
[02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:52.940]   - I didn't like that either.
[02:36:52.940 --> 02:36:55.380]   I think Sam doesn't like it either about himself.
[02:36:55.380 --> 02:36:56.660]   - Okay.
[02:36:56.660 --> 02:36:57.860]   - He regrets those things.
[02:36:57.860 --> 02:37:01.020]   - Because it's very easy to say from his perspective,
[02:37:01.020 --> 02:37:03.920]   look, this isn't the full,
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:05.820]   Rogan didn't show you the full side of the story.
[02:37:05.820 --> 02:37:06.980]   Here's the other side of the story.
[02:37:06.980 --> 02:37:08.780]   Please watch this and be informed.
[02:37:08.780 --> 02:37:11.080]   That's a very reasonable thing to say.
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:12.840]   - Yeah, I don't quite understand this.
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:14.880]   So they do this about each other now.
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:17.640]   I'll put three people on the table,
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:21.680]   which is Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, and Brett Weinstein.
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:23.680]   And they have a way of talking
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:27.440]   like the other person is creating a lot of harm.
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:30.240]   Like publicly would say things like that.
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:32.560]   And I understand there's emotion in it,
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:36.080]   but like these are human beings
[02:37:37.420 --> 02:37:39.640]   that are friends of yours.
[02:37:39.640 --> 02:37:40.760]   - But I'll go the other way.
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:43.360]   Let's suppose it is true that Joe's doing a lot of harm,
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:45.120]   spreading misinformation.
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:48.640]   Being sarcastic isn't going to be persuasive.
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:50.760]   Whereas if you're like, he's wrong,
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:53.880]   here's the facts, or be informed,
[02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:55.680]   to me, but then I'm not Sam Harris.
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:37:56.680]   He's got a bigger audience than me,
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:37:58.360]   so maybe he's the one who's right, not wrong.
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:00.680]   - No, he's just human.
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:02.440]   - Okay, well, I can't relate.
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:04.800]   - Well, have you seen your Twitter lately?
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:06.080]   I mean, you get very,
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:07.420]   you have a lot of fun on Twitter.
[02:38:07.420 --> 02:38:09.680]   I feel like Twitter lets--
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:12.300]   - I've never done that with someone I'm friends with.
[02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:13.300]   I never would.
[02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:15.860]   - Okay, let's put that on record
[02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:17.100]   before he trolls me. - It is on record.
[02:38:17.100 --> 02:38:18.540]   Because if there's an issue with you,
[02:38:18.540 --> 02:38:19.980]   I'm getting you on the phone.
[02:38:19.980 --> 02:38:21.940]   - Yeah, good.
[02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:22.780]   I mean, that's the way--
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:24.060]   - 'Cause then I'm not backing you into a corner publicly.
[02:38:24.060 --> 02:38:26.020]   It doesn't make any sense strategically.
[02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:29.860]   - Yeah, and actually, Brett Weinstein
[02:38:29.860 --> 02:38:33.020]   tweeted something, sort of criticizing something,
[02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:34.260]   I already forgot what.
[02:38:34.260 --> 02:38:36.080]   But he texted me first saying,
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:37.880]   "Is it okay if I tweet this?"
[02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:39.640]   And I said, "Yep."
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:41.600]   I was excited.
[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:45.080]   But I think there's some level of just,
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:48.160]   be compassionate privately and be compassionate publicly.
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:50.360]   - Or be civil.
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:51.200]   - Civil.
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:54.400]   For some reason, I don't like the word civility
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:56.580]   'cause it's polite.
[02:38:56.580 --> 02:39:00.520]   - Or be cordial, is that better?
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:01.600]   - No, what I mean is--
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:03.840]   - It seems phony to you?
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:04.920]   - It seems phony.
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:07.000]   You should radiate love in whatever way.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.280]   So even if you're rough with the other person,
[02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:13.760]   you should still show respect and love for that person.
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:15.640]   And that gets back to the Russian rules
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:16.640]   where they're yelling at each other,
[02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:18.640]   but there's still love underneath it.
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:21.120]   I mean, the question I wanna ask for you
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:27.220]   is I think you and I have a different view on some things.
[02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:29.480]   We have a different approach to things,
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:30.780]   just on the surface level,
[02:39:30.780 --> 02:39:33.060]   but also a different view on some things.
[02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:35.260]   I have a lot of hope for institutions.
[02:39:35.260 --> 02:39:39.200]   Maybe it's a gut instinct.
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:42.280]   Your gut instinct is like centers of power
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:46.840]   are like burn them down first and then let's figure it out.
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:48.960]   Or maybe that's a funny, rough way of saying it.
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:50.040]   - No, I think that's about right.
[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:52.000]   - And then for me, it's like,
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:55.520]   no, let's understand the institution and slowly,
[02:39:55.520 --> 02:39:59.960]   revolutions from within versus revolutions from without.
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:04.220]   But we can have those disagreements
[02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:06.660]   and there may be times when those disagreements will be,
[02:40:06.660 --> 02:40:08.280]   I could see in the future,
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:12.580]   I could see I'll be attacked by my friend, Michael Malice,
[02:40:12.580 --> 02:40:14.340]   which I very look forward to it.
[02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:15.780]   No, not attack, but you know what I mean,
[02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:18.060]   on the surface level, in the idea space.
[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:21.180]   Anyway, 'cause you're shaking your head now, you won't.
[02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:26.180]   I guess maybe this also goes to Sam Harrison, Joe Rogan.
[02:40:26.180 --> 02:40:28.940]   I would love to be able to disagree,
[02:40:28.940 --> 02:40:32.180]   disagree in big ways on important things
[02:40:32.180 --> 02:40:34.420]   and still be close friends.
[02:40:34.420 --> 02:40:37.460]   And I don't understand why those should be contradictions.
[02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:38.780]   - Yeah. - And that's the tension.
[02:40:38.780 --> 02:40:40.460]   That's been the most heartbreaking thing to me
[02:40:40.460 --> 02:40:45.460]   about Sam and Brett and Joe.
[02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:48.260]   Well, in the case of Brett, it's me, I don't know Brett,
[02:40:48.260 --> 02:40:50.340]   so I'm just like looking as somebody
[02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:52.580]   who just enjoys having these voices out there.
[02:40:52.580 --> 02:40:54.500]   And it seems like COVID just brought out the worst
[02:40:54.500 --> 02:40:56.720]   in some many folks.
[02:40:56.720 --> 02:40:59.940]   And it just feels like it's so sad to me
[02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:04.940]   to see their friendship somewhat deteriorating,
[02:41:04.940 --> 02:41:06.860]   or maybe I'm just being--
[02:41:06.860 --> 02:41:09.360]   - No, it seems clear it's deteriorated enormously.
[02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:11.780]   - Sad, if that's the case.
[02:41:11.780 --> 02:41:14.580]   - Yeah, so I've had people come at me,
[02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:15.940]   'cause I'm friends with you,
[02:41:15.940 --> 02:41:18.700]   and they were like, "Oh, Lex authored some paper about masks."
[02:41:18.700 --> 02:41:19.820]   I don't even know what the hell they're referring to,
[02:41:19.820 --> 02:41:20.700]   I don't care.
[02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:25.020]   I always say and mean, I don't care
[02:41:25.020 --> 02:41:28.220]   whether someone agrees with me, I care how they treat me.
[02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:29.300]   And it goes the other way,
[02:41:29.300 --> 02:41:30.860]   'cause I'll have a lot of people on Twitter
[02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:32.200]   who are like, "Oh, I'm on your team,"
[02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:33.660]   and blah, blah, blah, I'm like, "I don't know you,
[02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:34.780]   you're not my team."
[02:41:34.780 --> 02:41:36.260]   And just because you happen to agree with me,
[02:41:36.260 --> 02:41:37.780]   it's of no value to me.
[02:41:37.780 --> 02:41:40.820]   Like, I don't know you and I'm interested in knowing you.
[02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:43.060]   Many of my friends, I don't know what their politics are,
[02:41:43.060 --> 02:41:44.060]   I don't care.
[02:41:44.060 --> 02:41:46.380]   Like I care how we hang out, have a good time,
[02:41:46.380 --> 02:41:50.020]   watch dumb movies, watch YouTube, go to the store, whatever.
[02:41:50.020 --> 02:41:50.980]   I don't know what your politics are,
[02:41:50.980 --> 02:41:52.580]   I don't care what your politics are.
[02:41:52.580 --> 02:41:56.020]   Chris Williamson, who, you know, he's just here,
[02:41:56.020 --> 02:41:57.740]   he's gonna be moving to Austin.
[02:41:57.740 --> 02:41:59.620]   I only learned what his politics are in the last,
[02:41:59.620 --> 02:42:01.660]   we've been, we chat like almost every day,
[02:42:01.660 --> 02:42:04.100]   'cause he took the world's smallest political quiz,
[02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:05.540]   and he figured out what his answers were.
[02:42:05.540 --> 02:42:06.860]   I had no idea where he's-- - He's communist.
[02:42:06.860 --> 02:42:08.220]   - He's, well, obviously, yeah, yeah.
[02:42:08.220 --> 02:42:09.060]   - Marxist.
[02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:10.660]   - Yeah. - Let's be honest.
[02:42:10.660 --> 02:42:12.940]   (laughing)
[02:42:12.940 --> 02:42:15.500]   So, like, stuff like that, like, it never,
[02:42:15.500 --> 02:42:20.220]   and people, I think, because politics is often so tribal,
[02:42:20.220 --> 02:42:23.060]   especially now, they'll be like,
[02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:25.940]   "Oh, I could never be friends with someone who voted for X."
[02:42:25.940 --> 02:42:26.780]   Really?
[02:42:26.780 --> 02:42:28.220]   I feel like grandma worked in that campaign.
[02:42:28.220 --> 02:42:30.500]   What if, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:32.940]   You can't think of one steel man argument
[02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:34.100]   why this would happen,
[02:42:34.100 --> 02:42:36.740]   but if they just want to spite their boss.
[02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:39.500]   So, I don't like that approach at all.
[02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:41.060]   It makes no sense to me.
[02:42:41.060 --> 02:42:43.660]   - We could still have debates.
[02:42:43.660 --> 02:42:46.580]   I mean, like, I would still like to have those conversations
[02:42:46.580 --> 02:42:48.820]   and still have disagreements.
[02:42:48.820 --> 02:42:52.540]   Like, I disagree with Joe on COVID a lot,
[02:42:52.540 --> 02:42:54.940]   on a bunch of different things, very kinda,
[02:42:54.940 --> 02:42:58.260]   but it's never, like, it's not tense at all.
[02:42:58.260 --> 02:43:02.620]   It's just, it doesn't have that arrogance
[02:43:02.620 --> 02:43:06.340]   that a lot of COVID conversations seems to have,
[02:43:06.340 --> 02:43:09.940]   like, talking down to people from both directions.
[02:43:09.940 --> 02:43:11.540]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:43:11.540 --> 02:43:12.740]   - So, I would love to have those,
[02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:13.980]   'cause I love to debate.
[02:43:13.980 --> 02:43:14.820]   I love debates.
[02:43:14.820 --> 02:43:16.500]   - It takes a lot to get me triggered,
[02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:20.140]   and when the Babylon Bee were interviewing Elon,
[02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:21.620]   and he had this thing, he goes,
[02:43:21.620 --> 02:43:24.220]   "Well, I don't know anyone who wants to, you know,
[02:43:24.220 --> 02:43:27.860]   "abolish the FDA and the FAA, and I'm standing there,
[02:43:27.860 --> 02:43:30.060]   "and I'm shaking, and the guys look at me,
[02:43:30.060 --> 02:43:32.260]   "and they're like, 'Oh, we actually have an anarchist here,'"
[02:43:32.260 --> 02:43:34.620]   and the example he used was,
[02:43:34.620 --> 02:43:36.900]   "You know, look, if you're playing football,
[02:43:36.900 --> 02:43:37.980]   "you're gonna have a referee there,
[02:43:37.980 --> 02:43:39.420]   "and you want the referee, you know,
[02:43:39.420 --> 02:43:41.060]   "but the referee started playing the game,
[02:43:41.060 --> 02:43:43.260]   "it's not such a good thing."
[02:43:43.260 --> 02:43:44.100]   And I'm sitting there, I'm like,
[02:43:44.100 --> 02:43:46.580]   "The referee doesn't work for the state."
[02:43:46.580 --> 02:43:48.780]   The referee is a private individual
[02:43:48.780 --> 02:43:50.900]   working for this organization,
[02:43:50.900 --> 02:43:54.660]   and there's no reason at all that food quality,
[02:43:54.660 --> 02:43:56.700]   which is something crucially important,
[02:43:56.700 --> 02:43:59.220]   has to be or can only be delivered through the state
[02:43:59.220 --> 02:44:00.540]   and a government monopoly.
[02:44:00.540 --> 02:44:03.540]   - That's actually really interesting,
[02:44:03.540 --> 02:44:07.140]   just to link on that, just a little bit,
[02:44:07.140 --> 02:44:08.820]   with the vaccine and stuff like that,
[02:44:08.820 --> 02:44:10.580]   with the antiviral drugs, the FDA,
[02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:15.500]   so like, are you, like, who should be the referee?
[02:44:15.500 --> 02:44:16.780]   - Right.
[02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:17.820]   - Do you have an idea, like,
[02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:19.660]   what's the best referee for the vaccine?
[02:44:19.660 --> 02:44:21.500]   Is it just the market?
[02:44:21.500 --> 02:44:22.820]   Just let people decide?
[02:44:22.820 --> 02:44:26.100]   - This is tricky, because the thing that,
[02:44:26.100 --> 02:44:28.140]   I have not been following COVID as closely
[02:44:28.140 --> 02:44:32.260]   as Joe and Sam, as Mr. Harris, excuse me, and Mr. Musk.
[02:44:32.260 --> 02:44:36.540]   The point is, when anything like this is developing,
[02:44:36.540 --> 02:44:39.020]   there's gonna be a lot of misinformation out there,
[02:44:39.020 --> 02:44:42.140]   even from the scientists, because it's a dynamic process.
[02:44:42.140 --> 02:44:43.580]   They don't know what they're dealing with.
[02:44:43.580 --> 02:44:44.900]   A lot of it has to be speculative.
[02:44:44.900 --> 02:44:46.180]   They don't know long-term effects,
[02:44:46.180 --> 02:44:48.020]   'cause it hasn't been around for a long time.
[02:44:48.020 --> 02:44:53.020]   So I think it is very dangerous when, you know,
[02:44:53.020 --> 02:44:58.240]   when Joe was mocked for taking a laundry list of things,
[02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:00.660]   under his doctor's advice,
[02:45:00.660 --> 02:45:03.900]   and they kind of latched onto the ivermectin,
[02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:05.780]   and then they specifically said it was horse paste,
[02:45:05.780 --> 02:45:07.020]   although it's veterinary medicines,
[02:45:07.020 --> 02:45:09.180]   why didn't they say dog paste or cat paste?
[02:45:09.180 --> 02:45:11.140]   It's like, well, he's not dead,
[02:45:11.140 --> 02:45:15.780]   and he's also taking drugs which are used
[02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:17.700]   in other circumstances, the very least,
[02:45:17.700 --> 02:45:21.380]   maybe they're pointless, but if the drug is being allowed
[02:45:21.380 --> 02:45:23.900]   for pharmaceutical reasons, the odds are quite low
[02:45:23.900 --> 02:45:27.220]   that they're gonna have deleterious side effects in general.
[02:45:27.220 --> 02:45:31.780]   So I think this kind of insistence
[02:45:31.780 --> 02:45:36.780]   that there has to be one A, officially approved outcome,
[02:45:36.780 --> 02:45:38.700]   that we're all doing,
[02:45:38.700 --> 02:45:41.740]   that is kind of dangerous thinking in general.
[02:45:41.740 --> 02:45:43.620]   - By the way, I don't know if you saw,
[02:45:43.620 --> 02:45:46.520]   I got a chance to talk to the Pfizer CEO,
[02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:50.060]   and I had helped collecting questions,
[02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:51.020]   'cause I got a lot of questions,
[02:45:51.020 --> 02:45:53.700]   and people put at the top a question for Michael Malice.
[02:45:53.700 --> 02:45:54.540]   - Oh, really?
[02:45:54.540 --> 02:46:00.700]   - Ask him what he likes best about me.
[02:46:00.700 --> 02:46:02.540]   - Oh, what does he like best, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:46:02.540 --> 02:46:04.220]   - So I actually had that on my list of questions
[02:46:04.220 --> 02:46:07.380]   I was gonna ask him, and my plan was I'll ask him,
[02:46:07.380 --> 02:46:10.860]   Michael Malice wants to know what you like best about him,
[02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:12.780]   and then my guess was he'd be like, "Who?"
[02:46:12.780 --> 02:46:16.100]   And I'd be like, "Exactly," and then go on to the next.
[02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:20.060]   But I thought it was such a tense conversation
[02:46:20.060 --> 02:46:21.980]   that I thought there would be no--
[02:46:21.980 --> 02:46:22.820]   - Of course, room for levity.
[02:46:22.820 --> 02:46:24.380]   The question I would ask him is,
[02:46:24.380 --> 02:46:28.860]   can you acknowledge that there is an enormous incentive
[02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:32.460]   for your company to force everyone in America
[02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:35.700]   or everyone on Earth to be a consumer of your product?
[02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:37.260]   - Yeah. - That's my question.
[02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:39.620]   - So I dance around that question quite a lot.
[02:46:39.620 --> 02:46:45.220]   I phrase it differently, which is a conflict of interest
[02:46:45.220 --> 02:46:47.580]   and attention between making a lot of money
[02:46:47.580 --> 02:46:49.020]   and actually helping people.
[02:46:49.020 --> 02:46:54.060]   I've asked a lot of really heavy questions in that,
[02:46:54.060 --> 02:46:57.940]   and I still, and a lot of people wrote to me with support
[02:46:57.940 --> 02:47:01.940]   saying that was a really great conversation,
[02:47:01.940 --> 02:47:06.940]   and a lot of people wrote saying that it was just too soft.
[02:47:06.940 --> 02:47:13.980]   I don't know, I think about that a lot,
[02:47:13.980 --> 02:47:15.820]   like how do you have that conversation?
[02:47:15.820 --> 02:47:18.300]   I don't think it was too soft.
[02:47:18.300 --> 02:47:19.540]   And actually, just for the record,
[02:47:19.540 --> 02:47:22.740]   I wanna say that they didn't see
[02:47:22.740 --> 02:47:24.340]   any of the questions I'm asking.
[02:47:24.340 --> 02:47:27.380]   They didn't see the final interview.
[02:47:27.380 --> 02:47:28.820]   I can ask anything I want.
[02:47:28.820 --> 02:47:35.180]   So any questions that I asked and failed to ask
[02:47:35.180 --> 02:47:39.760]   is my own shortcomings.
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:43.220]   Also, not being a coward,
[02:47:43.220 --> 02:47:44.780]   I was afraid of nothing.
[02:47:44.780 --> 02:47:48.100]   Like what do I have to gain or lose exactly?
[02:47:48.100 --> 02:47:48.980]   Well, you have something to lose,
[02:47:48.980 --> 02:47:52.140]   because if you're, I do, I always do softballs,
[02:47:52.140 --> 02:47:55.620]   because if I'm going to make it difficult
[02:47:55.620 --> 02:47:57.700]   for someone to come to my show,
[02:47:57.700 --> 02:48:00.100]   a lot of people will be disincentivized to do the show,
[02:48:00.100 --> 02:48:01.400]   'cause like, well, I don't need this.
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:03.020]   I see, oh yeah, I wasn't thinking like that,
[02:48:03.020 --> 02:48:04.620]   but I was, I don't like to,
[02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:08.420]   what I think some fraction of folks wanted me to do
[02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:12.780]   is to yell at a person, like criticize them,
[02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:14.260]   not even ask questions, essentially.
[02:48:14.260 --> 02:48:15.220]   - Yeah, yeah, how dare you?
[02:48:15.220 --> 02:48:18.660]   - Yeah, but to me, my goal,
[02:48:18.660 --> 02:48:20.380]   my hope is with these conversations
[02:48:20.380 --> 02:48:22.820]   is not just to do how great you are
[02:48:22.820 --> 02:48:23.720]   and all that kind of stuff,
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:26.860]   is to bring out some deeper truth.
[02:48:26.860 --> 02:48:29.380]   Like the beautiful things is when you can together
[02:48:29.380 --> 02:48:32.860]   realize some truth, like you mentioned,
[02:48:32.860 --> 02:48:37.860]   that the incentive for everyone to take the vaccine
[02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:41.460]   is obviously high for the maker of a vaccine.
[02:48:41.460 --> 02:48:42.460]   - Yeah. - Right?
[02:48:42.460 --> 02:48:45.780]   And for them to arrive at that truth together,
[02:48:45.780 --> 02:48:50.780]   like that is a really difficult truth to operate under.
[02:48:50.780 --> 02:48:55.880]   Like, for example, I had a whole exchange with him about,
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:59.140]   this is Jordan Peterson asked this question,
[02:48:59.140 --> 02:49:01.780]   I use that as a kind of springboard,
[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:05.440]   which is the kind of open doors
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:08.100]   between the FDA, the CDC, and Pfizer.
[02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:09.660]   - Right. - Like some people
[02:49:09.660 --> 02:49:11.900]   work at Pfizer and then go to work at the FDA
[02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:13.780]   and then vice versa.
[02:49:13.780 --> 02:49:18.460]   And I brought up, this is my safe space,
[02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:22.140]   maybe yours too, just going back to the Soviet Union
[02:49:22.140 --> 02:49:26.180]   to look at the lessons of human nature and corruption.
[02:49:26.180 --> 02:49:29.700]   I said like, so there's two things,
[02:49:29.700 --> 02:49:34.700]   this looks bad, and two, this naturally leads to corruption.
[02:49:34.700 --> 02:49:36.680]   And I pushed this with several questions,
[02:49:36.680 --> 02:49:37.980]   but polite and respectful.
[02:49:37.980 --> 02:49:40.700]   And he ultimately said, you know, there's rules.
[02:49:41.780 --> 02:49:43.460]   There's the rule of law,
[02:49:43.460 --> 02:49:45.420]   and there's very strict rules about this,
[02:49:45.420 --> 02:49:47.540]   and we have to follow those rules.
[02:49:47.540 --> 02:49:49.620]   Otherwise, we get punished severely.
[02:49:49.620 --> 02:49:53.460]   So like his response is, people reacted to them as like,
[02:49:53.460 --> 02:49:55.260]   okay, that's the CEO doing the political,
[02:49:55.260 --> 02:49:58.600]   but there's also truth to what he's saying,
[02:49:58.600 --> 02:50:00.700]   that one of the beautiful things about America
[02:50:00.700 --> 02:50:04.100]   is that you can criticize the rule of law currently,
[02:50:04.100 --> 02:50:09.100]   but it's still, it's better than in the Soviet Union
[02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:11.700]   where people bribed each other.
[02:50:11.700 --> 02:50:16.700]   And, but still, he made it seem like there's no corruption.
[02:50:16.700 --> 02:50:23.100]   - People often ask me why I describe myself as an anarchist
[02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:24.840]   and not a narco-capitalist,
[02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:26.660]   because they think my views are more in line
[02:50:26.660 --> 02:50:28.580]   with that school of anarchism.
[02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:31.100]   And one of the other reasons you just gave me a good one
[02:50:31.100 --> 02:50:36.020]   is that if I am talking to someone who's a major CEO,
[02:50:36.020 --> 02:50:39.880]   I have that hardcore left anarchist view
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:42.660]   that this person is, if not the devil,
[02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:46.780]   certainly gonna be sinister at the very least.
[02:50:46.780 --> 02:50:49.740]   And if you can't say, listen,
[02:50:49.740 --> 02:50:51.420]   this happens inevitably with elites,
[02:50:51.420 --> 02:50:53.420]   it happens in universities,
[02:50:53.420 --> 02:50:55.040]   it happens in the food industry,
[02:50:55.040 --> 02:50:57.580]   there's only so many people at the top of these things,
[02:50:57.580 --> 02:51:00.300]   the field is small, and everyone's gonna know each other,
[02:51:00.300 --> 02:51:03.420]   which is kind of just the dynamics of any market,
[02:51:03.420 --> 02:51:05.180]   that would kind of be more reasonable.
[02:51:05.180 --> 02:51:08.140]   And just say, it's easy to caricature us
[02:51:08.140 --> 02:51:09.260]   'cause you're not in the boardroom,
[02:51:09.260 --> 02:51:12.620]   but we are trying to produce a product that people want.
[02:51:12.620 --> 02:51:17.300]   - Unlike the people who criticize me,
[02:51:17.300 --> 02:51:20.180]   I wasn't bothered by most things,
[02:51:20.180 --> 02:51:22.420]   but I was bothered by the fact
[02:51:22.420 --> 02:51:24.500]   that he didn't show more worry
[02:51:24.500 --> 02:51:27.220]   about the corrupting nature of money and power.
[02:51:27.220 --> 02:51:31.780]   If you say that there's no corruption,
[02:51:31.780 --> 02:51:36.400]   you should show that because we constantly worry about it,
[02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:39.860]   not because, look, there's rules.
[02:51:39.860 --> 02:51:41.500]   - Yeah, which are enforced by you.
[02:51:41.500 --> 02:51:42.600]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:51:42.600 --> 02:51:47.600]   So I think the only way to avoid for time
[02:51:47.600 --> 02:51:53.320]   the corrupting force of power is to freak out about it,
[02:51:53.320 --> 02:51:54.480]   nonstop.
[02:51:54.480 --> 02:51:56.800]   - The impression I always get from people like him,
[02:51:56.800 --> 02:51:57.880]   and I haven't seen the interview,
[02:51:57.880 --> 02:51:59.400]   and I won't be watching it,
[02:51:59.400 --> 02:52:03.520]   is they're genuinely convinced that they're good guys.
[02:52:05.160 --> 02:52:07.040]   And if you're the good guy,
[02:52:07.040 --> 02:52:09.960]   sure, corruption is a concern theoretically,
[02:52:09.960 --> 02:52:12.560]   but I know this guy at the FDA,
[02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:14.680]   I know this senator, sure, we disagree,
[02:52:14.680 --> 02:52:16.120]   sure, they do some things I don't like,
[02:52:16.120 --> 02:52:17.400]   but in terms of corrupt,
[02:52:17.400 --> 02:52:19.680]   they're not getting briefcases full of money,
[02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:21.520]   they're not gonna sell a vaccine
[02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:24.020]   that kills people in Georgia.
[02:52:24.020 --> 02:52:25.520]   So yeah, it's a concern theoretically,
[02:52:25.520 --> 02:52:27.200]   but this is 21st century.
[02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:29.280]   The thought process, I think, writes itself.
[02:52:29.280 --> 02:52:32.220]   - I think, yeah, having the humility,
[02:52:32.220 --> 02:52:34.680]   I do this all the time, maybe to a destructive level,
[02:52:34.680 --> 02:52:37.240]   thinking that I might be doing bad for the world,
[02:52:37.240 --> 02:52:38.640]   I might be wrong, I might be,
[02:52:38.640 --> 02:52:40.360]   that kind of thinking is very,
[02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:42.080]   you should do at least some of that,
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:44.680]   not to a point of being paralyzed, but a little bit.
[02:52:44.680 --> 02:52:46.440]   You're actually in the right mindset for me
[02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:49.640]   to ask you then for advice.
[02:52:49.640 --> 02:52:53.320]   You're in this compassionate, thoughtful mood, I like it,
[02:52:53.320 --> 02:52:54.940]   the compassionate, thoughtful, Michael.
[02:52:54.940 --> 02:52:57.820]   So for future conversations like that,
[02:52:57.820 --> 02:53:03.160]   so the person that offered a conversation
[02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:05.320]   that at first I avoided, but I might return to,
[02:53:05.320 --> 02:53:07.020]   is Anthony Fauci.
[02:53:07.020 --> 02:53:08.680]   So there's Anthony Fauci,
[02:53:08.680 --> 02:53:10.400]   but then there's also Trump and Biden,
[02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:11.640]   things, people like that.
[02:53:11.640 --> 02:53:14.640]   If you had them on your show,
[02:53:14.640 --> 02:53:17.900]   or just giving me advice on how to talk to them,
[02:53:17.900 --> 02:53:22.440]   what do you think is the right way to talk to them?
[02:53:22.440 --> 02:53:25.280]   And forget about future guests,
[02:53:25.280 --> 02:53:29.360]   but to get at something new, together.
[02:53:29.360 --> 02:53:31.880]   Get at something, not for views or likes or clicks
[02:53:31.880 --> 02:53:34.280]   or any of that, but discover something new
[02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:35.720]   through the mode of conversation.
[02:53:35.720 --> 02:53:37.480]   - Well, let's take those one at a time.
[02:53:37.480 --> 02:53:39.160]   So if I was talking to Trump,
[02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:41.840]   I told Ruben to ask Trump this and he didn't,
[02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:43.600]   what I wanted to know is,
[02:53:43.600 --> 02:53:44.840]   what's the look on your face
[02:53:44.840 --> 02:53:46.880]   when you're sending these tweets?
[02:53:46.880 --> 02:53:49.240]   'Cause I'm imagining him on the toilet with his phone.
[02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:51.200]   Are you cracking yourself up?
[02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:52.440]   Are you just completely stoic?
[02:53:52.440 --> 02:53:55.100]   Are you kind of that Trump little smirk he does?
[02:53:55.100 --> 02:53:59.680]   So when you get someone to open up about their emotion,
[02:53:59.680 --> 02:54:01.240]   about something they're passionate about,
[02:54:01.240 --> 02:54:03.080]   I think that breaks down some barriers
[02:54:03.080 --> 02:54:05.960]   and creates a bond. - That's a really good question.
[02:54:05.960 --> 02:54:08.520]   But Ruben wouldn't be, that's not his style.
[02:54:08.520 --> 02:54:10.040]   That's a great question for you to ask.
[02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:11.840]   - Well, I told him to say Michael Malice.
[02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:12.680]   - Oh, my sorry.
[02:54:12.680 --> 02:54:17.360]   - For Biden, that would be a tough one
[02:54:17.360 --> 02:54:19.820]   because Biden doesn't get enough credit
[02:54:19.820 --> 02:54:21.720]   for what a good politician he is.
[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:24.000]   There was this moment people can see on YouTube
[02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:27.520]   where Biden is addressing a room full of people
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:29.080]   and he had someone there and he goes,
[02:54:29.080 --> 02:54:30.680]   can you, why don't you stand up
[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:33.480]   so everyone can give you a hand?
[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:35.120]   And the guy was in a wheelchair.
[02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:36.920]   And Biden's like, oh, whoop.
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:39.280]   And like, but instantly he goes, you know what?
[02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:41.120]   We're all gonna stand up for you.
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:43.360]   And he made everyone get up and applaud the guy.
[02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:44.640]   I'm like, that's quick.
[02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:45.920]   Like, yeah, you made a fool of yourself.
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:47.960]   So he is a glad hander.
[02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:50.240]   In many ways, he's more of a schmoozer than Trump was.
[02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:52.800]   Like Trump made the point that he knows all the good people,
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:54.800]   but Biden knows how to shake hands.
[02:54:54.800 --> 02:54:56.800]   - Well, I think with both, and sorry to interrupt,
[02:54:56.800 --> 02:54:59.120]   with both Trump and Biden, like you mentioned earlier,
[02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:02.200]   to me at least, their family is fascinating.
[02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:04.960]   The dynamic as a family man, as a father, as a--
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:06.920]   - I think that Biden won't acknowledge
[02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:09.840]   his illegitimate grandkid is a problem for me.
[02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:12.680]   But at the same time, I can see why he think
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:13.760]   it's off limits to ask.
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:14.600]   'Cause that's the thing,
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:16.040]   when you're dealing with people that powerful,
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:18.440]   they're not used to having to answer questions
[02:55:18.440 --> 02:55:20.200]   which might be perfectly nice,
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:22.280]   but would cause them to freak the hell out.
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:24.680]   - That's the tricky thing of talking to people, as you know.
[02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:28.080]   Like some topics are off limit,
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:31.480]   not in that they draw lines, but they just shut down
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:32.380]   when you ask them.
[02:55:32.380 --> 02:55:36.840]   Trust me, I think I talked to Elon three times now.
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:38.640]   You better believe I brought up love.
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:41.360]   And how far do you think that got?
[02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:43.600]   You could just imagine-- - Zero, that's one.
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:47.520]   - We did exactly the kind of robot back and forth,
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:49.440]   and it just like shut down.
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:51.240]   So yeah, I worry about that with the personal.
[02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:53.880]   But that's the thing that makes it fascinating
[02:55:53.880 --> 02:55:55.440]   with those two.
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:55:59.040]   'Cause he had, with Hunter and losing his son,
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:02.000]   like the dynamic of the complexities of all that,
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:07.000]   like just having children fuck up in the way children do.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:12.000]   And then with Trump, the interesting dynamic.
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:13.440]   He has very different kids,
[02:56:13.440 --> 02:56:16.160]   and they're all kind of interesting in different ways.
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:18.920]   And maintaining connection with all of them
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:20.920]   and also letting them flourish individually
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:21.800]   is fascinating to me.
[02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:23.080]   - Well, I'd also wanna ask Trump
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:24.640]   if he can name all the presidents in order,
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:26.320]   which there's no he can.
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:28.120]   But I'd also wanna know-- - All the,
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:30.320]   do you think he knows who the second president
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:31.520]   of the United States is?
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:32.840]   - Yes. - No, okay.
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:33.840]   - John Adams, he knows.
[02:56:33.840 --> 02:56:37.080]   I think when it gets between Ulysses S. Grant and McKinley,
[02:56:37.080 --> 02:56:39.120]   that's when we all screw up.
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:41.000]   That window, it's tough.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.520]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm sure that's the one window where he,
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:45.320]   I mean, he's not-- - He's gonna be able
[02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:47.680]   to get back to FDR, no question.
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:51.720]   - I have to, my sense was with Donald Trump,
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:56:54.720]   and this is not, I would say, a criticism,
[02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:56.920]   is he doesn't have a depth of knowledge
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:56:59.560]   or, more importantly, curiosity about history.
[02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:00.920]   - Yeah, but if you're old enough,
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:02.840]   you're gonna at least remember the presidents
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:03.780]   in your lifetime.
[02:57:03.780 --> 02:57:06.560]   - In your lifetime, yeah, yeah, sorry.
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:07.480]   - Yeah, so that's what I'm saying.
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:09.800]   He'll get us from president to FDR pretty easily.
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:11.840]   - Yeah, yeah, okay, sure.
[02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:14.000]   I thought you meant FDR from the other direction.
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.280]   - No, no, yeah, from current to FDR.
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:19.720]   - Yeah, but yeah, from a political perspective,
[02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:24.160]   like having a conversation about politics with those two,
[02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:28.940]   there is interesting topics,
[02:57:28.940 --> 02:57:31.960]   interaction between Donald Trump and Putin,
[02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:35.560]   not the interaction, like not the stupid journalistic stuff,
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:39.400]   but it's clear to me that he is a student of power.
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:40.640]   - Oh, for sure.
[02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:43.520]   - And like he enjoys the game of power.
[02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:44.800]   - Yeah. - And so it's interesting,
[02:57:44.800 --> 02:57:47.800]   'cause to me, the reason he admires Putin
[02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:50.520]   is it's another player in the game of power.
[02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:54.240]   - And I think why so many people hate him, Trump,
[02:57:54.240 --> 02:57:56.240]   is that he demonstrated to a lot of Americans
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:57:58.920]   how much of a con job most of politics is
[02:57:58.920 --> 02:58:01.240]   and how people just say what they need to do,
[02:58:01.240 --> 02:58:03.640]   but behind closed doors, these people are buffoons,
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:05.000]   and he exposed them as that.
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.760]   I'd also, so the Biden,
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:10.860]   I think Biden would be a tougher interview than Trump
[02:58:10.860 --> 02:58:12.940]   because I feel like Biden's more slippery in many ways.
[02:58:12.940 --> 02:58:15.240]   He's much more of a consummate politician.
[02:58:15.240 --> 02:58:17.760]   He's been in the Senate since the early '70s.
[02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:20.080]   Since he was like 30 or 35, whatever it was.
[02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:25.120]   So he'd have his little kind of pat answers.
[02:58:25.120 --> 02:58:26.680]   There was Larry King,
[02:58:26.680 --> 02:58:29.280]   who was certainly a softball interviewer,
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:30.760]   and I don't begrudge him that at all.
[02:58:30.760 --> 02:58:31.880]   I remember it was very vividly,
[02:58:31.880 --> 02:58:34.760]   and it was like, I think it was the 2008 cycle.
[02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:38.800]   He asked Hillary, "Why do you think so many people hate you?"
[02:58:38.800 --> 02:58:41.640]   And she just goes like, "Oh, well, I take tough stances."
[02:58:41.640 --> 02:58:42.920]   And he cut her off.
[02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:44.480]   He goes, "Other people have taken those stances.
[02:58:44.480 --> 02:58:45.720]   "Why do they hate you?"
[02:58:45.720 --> 02:58:47.880]   And she didn't really, I was really impressed with him
[02:58:47.880 --> 02:58:50.320]   that he didn't let her off the hook.
[02:58:50.320 --> 02:58:51.760]   - That to me is great.
[02:58:51.760 --> 02:58:54.840]   But some people will say that's still too softball.
[02:58:54.840 --> 02:58:58.600]   'Cause you, like they would want him to start listing,
[02:58:58.600 --> 02:59:02.200]   I don't know, droning, like all the things
[02:59:02.200 --> 02:59:04.120]   that Hillary Clinton is criticized for.
[02:59:04.120 --> 02:59:06.040]   - Yeah, but then what she, she's done this many times.
[02:59:06.040 --> 02:59:06.880]   She's very good at this.
[02:59:06.880 --> 02:59:09.200]   She'll be like, "Look, I've addressed all these in the past.
[02:59:09.200 --> 02:59:11.940]   "If you wanna start rehashing Republican talking points,
[02:59:11.940 --> 02:59:13.280]   "you can go look up my interviews."
[02:59:13.280 --> 02:59:14.520]   - Yeah, I think it's counterproductive.
[02:59:14.520 --> 02:59:15.360]   - Yeah.
[02:59:15.360 --> 02:59:19.760]   - But I think about the more prescient for me,
[02:59:19.760 --> 02:59:21.440]   I can't believe I'm walking through this fire
[02:59:21.440 --> 02:59:23.640]   for no good reason whatsoever, but Anthony Fauci.
[02:59:23.640 --> 02:59:26.840]   So let me tell you why I care about Anthony Fauci.
[02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:30.040]   Because I care a lot about science
[02:59:30.040 --> 02:59:32.460]   and the way science is viewed in society.
[02:59:32.460 --> 02:59:36.880]   And not to put it at the feet of this one person,
[02:59:36.880 --> 02:59:41.880]   but him and certain members of the scientific community
[02:59:43.040 --> 02:59:46.840]   that was responsible for managing the response to COVID,
[02:59:46.840 --> 02:59:50.640]   I think are somewhat or entirely responsible
[02:59:50.640 --> 02:59:54.200]   for a significant decrease in trust in science.
[02:59:54.200 --> 02:59:55.040]   - Yes, no question.
[02:59:55.040 --> 02:59:55.880]   - In the past couple of years.
[02:59:55.880 --> 02:59:57.420]   - There was a poll that just came out this week
[02:59:57.420 --> 02:59:59.740]   that said the number has just collapsed.
[02:59:59.740 --> 03:00:03.320]   - And if you don't blame him for it,
[03:00:03.320 --> 03:00:08.320]   I personally blame him for not improving the problem.
[03:00:10.240 --> 03:00:14.160]   And so there's definitely would be a harsh conversation
[03:00:14.160 --> 03:00:15.000]   there to be had.
[03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:19.200]   And I think I wanna have it, but how do you do it?
[03:00:19.200 --> 03:00:20.320]   It's tough.
[03:00:20.320 --> 03:00:21.160]   - Yeah.
[03:00:21.160 --> 03:00:24.200]   - Because again, politicians, there's political answers.
[03:00:24.200 --> 03:00:26.880]   If they get too frustrated too quickly,
[03:00:26.880 --> 03:00:29.360]   they will not explore these difficult things with you.
[03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:30.520]   They'll just shut down.
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:34.120]   But then if you say too many nice things,
[03:00:34.120 --> 03:00:36.840]   because I should also say Anthony Fauci
[03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:39.160]   is an incredible career.
[03:00:39.160 --> 03:00:42.280]   Like there's several hours worth of conversation
[03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:44.640]   to be had about how amazing of a person he is.
[03:00:44.640 --> 03:00:46.560]   - Well, I would also be curious about the AIDS stuff.
[03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:47.400]   - Yes.
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:48.560]   - 'Cause that's something that's criticized about,
[03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:49.840]   and I wouldn't come at it aggressively.
[03:00:49.840 --> 03:00:51.080]   I would say, let's set the record straight.
[03:00:51.080 --> 03:00:53.820]   This is some of the criticism you get, blah, blah, blah.
[03:00:53.820 --> 03:00:55.560]   You're rolling in the AIDS crisis.
[03:00:55.560 --> 03:00:56.600]   Let's talk about this.
[03:00:56.600 --> 03:00:58.120]   And this is something that is important
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:00:58.960]   part of American history.
[03:00:58.960 --> 03:01:00.120]   There was a pandemic,
[03:01:00.120 --> 03:01:02.520]   and it was localized to certain populations.
[03:01:02.520 --> 03:01:04.560]   And that population at the first at least
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:06.760]   was pretty much told goodbye and good luck.
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:08.040]   You're gonna have to deal with this.
[03:01:08.040 --> 03:01:09.640]   So how did you deal with that?
[03:01:09.640 --> 03:01:11.240]   I mean, were you scared of getting AIDS?
[03:01:11.240 --> 03:01:12.500]   You know, so on and so forth.
[03:01:12.500 --> 03:01:14.500]   But also there was that comment when,
[03:01:14.500 --> 03:01:18.120]   and correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not a Fauci expert,
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:21.360]   when he basically, they told people not to wear masks
[03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:23.040]   or they lied about it to some extent
[03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:25.120]   because they said then people were gonna run out of them
[03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:25.960]   or something like that.
[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:28.120]   And they admitted they were being inaccurate.
[03:01:28.120 --> 03:01:29.640]   I would nail him on that.
[03:01:29.640 --> 03:01:30.600]   I'm like, let's address this.
[03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:32.080]   Were you being dishonest?
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:34.120]   Is there sometimes when it's important to be dishonest
[03:01:34.120 --> 03:01:35.440]   in service of whatever?
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:38.760]   Also, I would ask him how, as someone who's not a politician,
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:41.360]   whether his level of fame and adulation
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:42.640]   has gotten to his head.
[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:45.120]   How do you have a perspective when,
[03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:47.240]   and how does it feel when a sitting senator
[03:01:47.240 --> 03:01:48.840]   tells you that you should be imprisoned?
[03:01:48.840 --> 03:01:50.200]   Do you think Ted Cruz means it?
[03:01:50.200 --> 03:01:53.000]   Or you think Ted Cruz is just playing to his base?
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.200]   - Yeah, I like the fame one.
[03:01:55.200 --> 03:01:58.120]   I would love to sneak up.
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:01:59.960]   I mean, that question applies to you too.
[03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:01.920]   That question applies to me.
[03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:04.800]   When you start getting more fame or money or power,
[03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:08.200]   are you aware of how that changed you?
[03:02:08.200 --> 03:02:09.640]   And explore that.
[03:02:09.640 --> 03:02:12.160]   How has that changed you?
[03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:16.480]   In the privacy of your mind, Michael Malice,
[03:02:16.480 --> 03:02:19.680]   how did you change now that you've gotten
[03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:22.480]   more attention, let's say?
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:24.080]   Or even the success of the book.
[03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:26.760]   Take yourself back to the,
[03:02:26.760 --> 03:02:31.760]   you talk about the early 20s, the mid-20s person.
[03:02:31.760 --> 03:02:33.640]   How are you different from that person?
[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:34.520]   Are you the same person?
[03:02:34.520 --> 03:02:35.960]   Or are you totally different?
[03:02:35.960 --> 03:02:37.040]   That's an interesting thought.
[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:40.960]   Is Putin the same person in 2020 as he was in 2010
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:42.240]   and then in 2000?
[03:02:42.240 --> 03:02:47.760]   It's a non-trivial, almost like--
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:50.840]   - And then the other thing with Fauci is,
[03:02:50.840 --> 03:02:52.600]   this is a dynamic system.
[03:02:52.600 --> 03:02:54.200]   Like on the one hand, he's gonna wanna say
[03:02:54.200 --> 03:02:56.320]   we got it right every time, right?
[03:02:56.320 --> 03:02:57.520]   But then how is that even possible
[03:02:57.520 --> 03:02:59.360]   when you're dealing with an evolving,
[03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:01.880]   unknown, dynamic situation?
[03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:03.120]   When did you guys get it wrong?
[03:03:03.120 --> 03:03:04.440]   Did that result in lives lost?
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:06.360]   Do you feel guilty about that?
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:08.480]   - I mean, the big problem with the masks,
[03:03:08.480 --> 03:03:10.320]   the changing of mind on the mask
[03:03:10.320 --> 03:03:12.680]   is the arrogance in how it was communicated.
[03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:14.640]   To me, a lot of this boils down to
[03:03:14.640 --> 03:03:18.160]   how things are communicated.
[03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:20.360]   It's like, it's obvious that you need to change your mind
[03:03:20.360 --> 03:03:21.360]   when you get new information.
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:23.960]   Or sometimes, yeah, you take policies that are like,
[03:03:23.960 --> 03:03:27.000]   we know the truth, but we're going to lie
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.960]   for a particular reason, like you have good intentions.
[03:03:29.960 --> 03:03:32.760]   But if you're not able to communicate that later,
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:33.960]   like we made a mistake.
[03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:37.160]   - Or even ask him, can you understand how
[03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:41.640]   a rational person might choose not to get vaccinated?
[03:03:41.640 --> 03:03:46.120]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:48.720]   - And if he can't steel man that, then that's a situation.
[03:03:48.720 --> 03:03:50.320]   - That's a good test, and I've tried,
[03:03:50.320 --> 03:03:52.400]   and some people succeed and some people fail.
[03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:54.600]   The ability to really steel man the other,
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:03:57.240]   understand that somebody would be hesitant
[03:03:57.240 --> 03:04:00.880]   about taking the vaccine, yeah.
[03:04:00.880 --> 03:04:03.200]   It's a giant mess, man.
[03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:06.200]   This podcast thing, it's just a fun little conversation,
[03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:08.400]   but it also has a responsibility.
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:10.600]   I don't know, I don't know how Joe does it.
[03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:14.320]   - I don't think Joe cares as much as you do.
[03:04:14.320 --> 03:04:16.600]   It's more fun for him in a sense,
[03:04:16.600 --> 03:04:17.960]   and he's less concerned about the,
[03:04:17.960 --> 03:04:19.920]   I mean, he's not unconcerned with the cultural impact,
[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:22.000]   but for him, it's just more bro-ing out.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:22.840]   - Yeah.
[03:04:22.840 --> 03:04:23.760]   - Like, he doesn't do as much prep.
[03:04:23.760 --> 03:04:25.000]   He doesn't come in with three pages,
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.560]   single spaced of questions.
[03:04:27.560 --> 03:04:28.400]   - Yeah, and--
[03:04:28.400 --> 03:04:31.840]   - That's why he's talking to Blair White for 10 minutes
[03:04:31.840 --> 03:04:34.880]   about whether sharks lay eggs without knowing.
[03:04:34.880 --> 03:04:36.240]   - You're the one triggered person.
[03:04:36.240 --> 03:04:40.000]   He didn't, maybe he trolled the troll.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:40.840]   - Well, it worked.
[03:04:40.840 --> 03:04:42.200]   Yeah, he did.
[03:04:42.200 --> 03:04:43.200]   - Do sharks lay eggs?
[03:04:43.200 --> 03:04:47.200]   I'd like to get an updated 2021 version
[03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:50.480]   of Michael Malice giving advice to young people.
[03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:52.560]   - Okay.
[03:04:52.560 --> 03:04:57.360]   - So there's, God forbid, high school students,
[03:04:57.360 --> 03:05:00.580]   college students listening to you,
[03:05:01.460 --> 03:05:03.300]   and looking to you for advice.
[03:05:03.300 --> 03:05:05.540]   What advice would you give them about career
[03:05:05.540 --> 03:05:10.220]   and about life, how to live a life that you can be proud of?
[03:05:10.220 --> 03:05:12.660]   - This happens a lot, 'cause I have my Locals community,
[03:05:12.660 --> 03:05:14.700]   malice.locals.com, and there's a lot of young people
[03:05:14.700 --> 03:05:15.540]   on there.
[03:05:15.540 --> 03:05:17.140]   - Yeah, that's a great place.
[03:05:17.140 --> 03:05:19.060]   - I'll give them a meta piece of advice.
[03:05:19.060 --> 03:05:21.900]   Don't ask your friends for advice,
[03:05:21.900 --> 03:05:23.420]   'cause you're an idiot at your age,
[03:05:23.420 --> 03:05:24.660]   and they're all idiots,
[03:05:24.660 --> 03:05:25.940]   and they don't wanna seem like idiots,
[03:05:25.940 --> 03:05:26.940]   so they're just gonna give you advice.
[03:05:26.940 --> 03:05:28.180]   They pulled it from the TV,
[03:05:28.180 --> 03:05:29.500]   and no one knows what you're talking about,
[03:05:29.500 --> 03:05:31.220]   and it's just gonna be counterintuitive.
[03:05:31.220 --> 03:05:36.220]   So seek out advice from people who you seek to emulate,
[03:05:36.220 --> 03:05:38.740]   and ask them for advice.
[03:05:38.740 --> 03:05:39.660]   If you can't get ahold of them,
[03:05:39.660 --> 03:05:41.460]   figure out a way to get ahold of them.
[03:05:41.460 --> 03:05:43.580]   Incentivize them in some way.
[03:05:43.580 --> 03:05:46.380]   You'd be surprised how many people are responsive on Twitter
[03:05:46.380 --> 03:05:48.220]   or in social media if you just ask them
[03:05:48.220 --> 03:05:50.460]   a basic life question, 'cause then they can quote, tweet,
[03:05:50.460 --> 03:05:52.340]   and answer to a whole population.
[03:05:52.340 --> 03:05:54.820]   So that would be one mechanism.
[03:05:54.820 --> 03:05:57.780]   It's also very hard at that age to realize
[03:05:57.780 --> 03:06:00.940]   your parents might not be all that bright,
[03:06:00.940 --> 03:06:03.700]   and they might not be all that good people.
[03:06:03.700 --> 03:06:05.660]   So that's a hard one at that age
[03:06:05.660 --> 03:06:07.340]   to kinda wrap your head around.
[03:06:07.340 --> 03:06:09.500]   Just 'cause they love you doesn't mean they understand you,
[03:06:09.500 --> 03:06:10.900]   and that's okay.
[03:06:10.900 --> 03:06:12.140]   That's okay.
[03:06:12.140 --> 03:06:13.140]   We like everybody.
[03:06:13.140 --> 03:06:16.180]   - Shit, your Trump's pretty good too.
[03:06:16.180 --> 03:06:18.420]   I'd like your Trump to talk to Elon,
[03:06:18.420 --> 03:06:20.180]   to have a conversation.
[03:06:20.180 --> 03:06:23.940]   - Well, Mr. President, look,
[03:06:24.780 --> 03:06:28.060]   some things you did, like some, not so much,
[03:06:28.060 --> 03:06:30.340]   but for the most part, I think,
[03:06:30.340 --> 03:06:31.620]   did a kinda good thing.
[03:06:31.620 --> 03:06:32.980]   What are you talking about?
[03:06:32.980 --> 03:06:35.220]   (laughing)
[03:06:35.220 --> 03:06:41.140]   Hey guys, what are we talking about?
[03:06:41.140 --> 03:06:42.300]   No, I fucked up the lex.
[03:06:42.300 --> 03:06:44.420]   Anyway, so those would be two pieces.
[03:06:44.420 --> 03:06:48.780]   The other piece of advice I would say is join a gym
[03:06:48.780 --> 03:06:53.780]   or have some kind of quantifiable daily improvement.
[03:06:54.780 --> 03:06:56.220]   To keep you sane.
[03:06:56.220 --> 03:06:58.540]   So the reason I always say weightlifting,
[03:06:58.540 --> 03:07:02.140]   and it could be running, it could be jump rope,
[03:07:02.140 --> 03:07:03.220]   I don't care what it is,
[03:07:03.220 --> 03:07:04.860]   because if you have those numbers
[03:07:04.860 --> 03:07:06.620]   moving in the positive direction,
[03:07:06.620 --> 03:07:08.300]   psychologically, if you're dealing with depression
[03:07:08.300 --> 03:07:11.780]   or anxiety, it's concrete proof to shut your brain up.
[03:07:11.780 --> 03:07:15.500]   Because your brain knows how to talk to you.
[03:07:15.500 --> 03:07:16.780]   Your brain is often your enemy,
[03:07:16.780 --> 03:07:19.420]   and it'll say exactly the right thing to undermine you.
[03:07:19.420 --> 03:07:20.980]   So that's an issue.
[03:07:22.940 --> 03:07:25.060]   I just, this works for me,
[03:07:25.060 --> 03:07:26.540]   maybe it won't for most people.
[03:07:26.540 --> 03:07:28.380]   I'm very high on the openness metric.
[03:07:28.380 --> 03:07:30.900]   Try new experiences, new things,
[03:07:30.900 --> 03:07:32.900]   try things you don't like.
[03:07:32.900 --> 03:07:34.340]   It's okay to have a bad experience,
[03:07:34.340 --> 03:07:35.540]   you've learned something.
[03:07:35.540 --> 03:07:38.180]   So go to a restaurant of a cuisine you wouldn't like
[03:07:38.180 --> 03:07:41.060]   or hadn't heard of, read a book that's popular
[03:07:41.060 --> 03:07:42.500]   but you have no interest in.
[03:07:42.500 --> 03:07:44.540]   Read a lot.
[03:07:44.540 --> 03:07:47.260]   For example, I didn't know anything about the election,
[03:07:47.260 --> 03:07:49.620]   what was it, 1892, when there was like a split
[03:07:49.620 --> 03:07:50.700]   between the electors.
[03:07:50.700 --> 03:07:51.780]   Read a book about it.
[03:07:51.780 --> 03:07:52.740]   Oh, I don't know anything.
[03:07:52.740 --> 03:07:54.460]   You know, I don't know anything really about Malcolm X.
[03:07:54.460 --> 03:07:55.900]   Read a book about him.
[03:07:55.900 --> 03:07:59.660]   You'll be amazed how much more full you become as a person.
[03:07:59.660 --> 03:08:02.100]   - Do you see value in writing also?
[03:08:02.100 --> 03:08:03.940]   Like writing down your ideas?
[03:08:03.940 --> 03:08:05.500]   - No, I think there's very little value in that.
[03:08:05.500 --> 03:08:06.860]   I'm not joking.
[03:08:06.860 --> 03:08:08.060]   - So reading is where the biggest--
[03:08:08.060 --> 03:08:09.500]   - Yeah, 'cause you're probably not gonna revisit
[03:08:09.500 --> 03:08:11.460]   what you've written down.
[03:08:11.460 --> 03:08:14.180]   - But the act of writing, you don't see,
[03:08:14.180 --> 03:08:16.100]   it solidifies somehow thoughts in your mind?
[03:08:16.100 --> 03:08:16.940]   - Not for me.
[03:08:16.940 --> 03:08:17.780]   - It doesn't for you?
[03:08:17.780 --> 03:08:19.900]   - Like a tweet will, 'cause then I have to have it
[03:08:19.900 --> 03:08:22.700]   narrowed down into like a phrase.
[03:08:22.700 --> 03:08:25.500]   - Or the responsibility of there being an audience.
[03:08:25.500 --> 03:08:27.780]   - No, I just meant in terms of I've got 280 characters.
[03:08:27.780 --> 03:08:30.180]   If instead of having a meandering thought,
[03:08:30.180 --> 03:08:33.300]   I have to codify it in something that's catchy and short,
[03:08:33.300 --> 03:08:35.340]   that's a good, useful mental exercise.
[03:08:35.340 --> 03:08:37.540]   - What face do you make when you tweet?
[03:08:37.540 --> 03:08:39.780]   - I wouldn't know.
[03:08:39.780 --> 03:08:40.620]   I don't know.
[03:08:40.620 --> 03:08:41.820]   That's a good point.
[03:08:41.820 --> 03:08:42.700]   - Is it on the toilet?
[03:08:42.700 --> 03:08:44.660]   How much, what percentage is on the toilet?
[03:08:44.660 --> 03:08:45.500]   - Very little.
[03:08:45.500 --> 03:08:47.220]   On the toilets, I usually am more reading.
[03:08:47.220 --> 03:08:48.420]   - Okay.
[03:08:48.420 --> 03:08:50.940]   - So even though my tweets are all literally shit,
[03:08:50.940 --> 03:08:52.780]   very few of them are on the toilet.
[03:08:52.780 --> 03:08:54.820]   - They're on a throne.
[03:08:54.820 --> 03:08:56.100]   - That's some advice.
[03:08:56.100 --> 03:09:01.900]   Don't compare yourself to other people.
[03:09:01.900 --> 03:09:03.580]   That's a really dangerous one.
[03:09:03.580 --> 03:09:05.900]   All my friends are married.
[03:09:05.900 --> 03:09:08.300]   I should have a kid by now.
[03:09:08.300 --> 03:09:10.380]   Should, there's an expression in recovery,
[03:09:10.380 --> 03:09:12.020]   stop shitting yourself.
[03:09:12.020 --> 03:09:14.460]   But it's, should, should, should.
[03:09:14.460 --> 03:09:15.660]   It's stupid.
[03:09:15.660 --> 03:09:19.980]   I also, and this could be my hoarder brain,
[03:09:19.980 --> 03:09:22.780]   I surround my house with talismans of joy.
[03:09:22.780 --> 03:09:25.300]   So if you have an accomplishment,
[03:09:25.300 --> 03:09:27.220]   like when I did Rogan once,
[03:09:27.220 --> 03:09:28.980]   I bought, went to the sock store
[03:09:28.980 --> 03:09:31.700]   and I bought these orange socks with black cherries on them.
[03:09:31.700 --> 03:09:33.620]   And now whenever I wore those socks,
[03:09:33.620 --> 03:09:35.420]   I'm like, oh, this is 'cause I was on Rogan.
[03:09:35.420 --> 03:09:36.700]   That was kind of a big deal.
[03:09:36.700 --> 03:09:39.140]   So if you have these little things throughout your house,
[03:09:39.140 --> 03:09:41.260]   it's, it was good mental fuel.
[03:09:41.260 --> 03:09:42.460]   Even like a toy.
[03:09:42.460 --> 03:09:43.900]   Remember when I was a kid, oh, you know what?
[03:09:43.900 --> 03:09:46.740]   This, little moments that inspire happiness,
[03:09:46.740 --> 03:09:48.380]   I think are visually very useful.
[03:09:49.660 --> 03:09:51.140]   So that's another one.
[03:09:51.140 --> 03:09:53.820]   And--
[03:09:53.820 --> 03:09:57.740]   - I, by the way, have the, that, the watch.
[03:09:57.740 --> 03:10:01.980]   'Cause we're talking about 2021.
[03:10:01.980 --> 03:10:03.140]   That was really,
[03:10:03.140 --> 03:10:07.860]   the guy in the lecture hall giving you a pat in the back,
[03:10:07.860 --> 03:10:11.180]   I wrote, Joe gave me the watch.
[03:10:11.180 --> 03:10:14.420]   Was, yeah, it's life changing for me.
[03:10:14.420 --> 03:10:15.460]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:10:15.460 --> 03:10:16.940]   - It doesn't even, it didn't,
[03:10:16.940 --> 03:10:18.860]   the fact that it was on a podcast or whatever,
[03:10:18.860 --> 03:10:19.700]   doesn't matter.
[03:10:19.700 --> 03:10:23.620]   - Learn how to form boundaries.
[03:10:23.620 --> 03:10:24.500]   That's probably the biggest,
[03:10:24.500 --> 03:10:26.300]   that's gonna be number one on my list.
[03:10:26.300 --> 03:10:27.220]   Because-- - Can you explain?
[03:10:27.220 --> 03:10:28.580]   - You're gonna have people around you
[03:10:28.580 --> 03:10:30.900]   who feel the need that they're entitled to your time,
[03:10:30.900 --> 03:10:32.380]   who feel the need to criticize you,
[03:10:32.380 --> 03:10:34.620]   and they're not coming from a good place.
[03:10:34.620 --> 03:10:36.100]   So it's very good for you to be like,
[03:10:36.100 --> 03:10:38.060]   I'm not interested in talking about this anymore right now.
[03:10:38.060 --> 03:10:39.740]   - Yeah, even if it's your parents.
[03:10:39.740 --> 03:10:41.460]   - Even if it's your, especially if it's your parents.
[03:10:41.460 --> 03:10:42.820]   Like, I need my space right now.
[03:10:42.820 --> 03:10:44.020]   You're entitled to your space.
[03:10:44.020 --> 03:10:45.300]   You're entitled to your time.
[03:10:45.300 --> 03:10:47.740]   No one owes you, you don't owe anyone a response.
[03:10:47.740 --> 03:10:49.940]   If someone has a question, you owe them an answer,
[03:10:49.940 --> 03:10:51.540]   especially if they're not coming at you in good faith
[03:10:51.540 --> 03:10:53.580]   or they're coming at you in a hostile way.
[03:10:53.580 --> 03:10:55.060]   That's a big one.
[03:10:55.060 --> 03:10:56.620]   It's hard to learn at that age.
[03:10:56.620 --> 03:11:02.700]   And be valuable to those who are around you.
[03:11:02.700 --> 03:11:09.620]   Be someone who people are happy to see.
[03:11:09.620 --> 03:11:11.660]   And if things are bad,
[03:11:11.660 --> 03:11:14.060]   like you're the one that they can rely on.
[03:11:14.060 --> 03:11:16.900]   Like I was just a little bit under the weather
[03:11:16.900 --> 03:11:18.020]   and I thought to myself, you know what,
[03:11:18.020 --> 03:11:20.060]   if things got really bad, I'll call Blair
[03:11:20.060 --> 03:11:21.660]   and she would take care of me
[03:11:21.660 --> 03:11:23.980]   and that kind of was very reassuring.
[03:11:23.980 --> 03:11:27.020]   - And you can always call me if you need
[03:11:27.020 --> 03:11:32.020]   heavy stuff lifted in an urgent matter.
[03:11:32.020 --> 03:11:34.020]   - Because of the robots?
[03:11:34.020 --> 03:11:35.940]   - No, just me, it's kind of like,
[03:11:35.940 --> 03:11:37.460]   those are the things I can help with.
[03:11:37.460 --> 03:11:39.260]   Or you're actually literally bleeding.
[03:11:39.260 --> 03:11:41.260]   I'm not a good caretaker, I can save you though.
[03:11:41.260 --> 03:11:44.260]   I can murder, if you need somebody murdered, I can do this.
[03:11:44.860 --> 03:11:49.100]   - Wait, what advice would you have to kids that age?
[03:11:49.100 --> 03:11:54.340]   And you're a lot younger than you think you are,
[03:11:54.340 --> 03:11:55.820]   that's the other one.
[03:11:55.820 --> 03:11:57.100]   - Yeah, there's time.
[03:11:57.100 --> 03:12:01.260]   - I know, it's impossible to understand when you're 26
[03:12:01.260 --> 03:12:03.060]   that your 40s are better than your 30s.
[03:12:03.060 --> 03:12:05.420]   'Cause like, okay, old man, that's all cope.
[03:12:05.420 --> 03:12:06.780]   I promise you it is.
[03:12:06.780 --> 03:12:11.220]   - Yeah, I think you said so many beautiful things.
[03:12:11.220 --> 03:12:16.220]   I would say another version of the openness,
[03:12:16.220 --> 03:12:19.060]   I would say take big risks when you're young.
[03:12:19.060 --> 03:12:20.780]   - Yeah, 'cause if you fail, who cares?
[03:12:20.780 --> 03:12:22.660]   You're sleeping in a futon, who cares?
[03:12:22.660 --> 03:12:24.340]   - Yeah, and take them often.
[03:12:24.340 --> 03:12:25.180]   - Yeah.
[03:12:25.180 --> 03:12:29.120]   - Also, this is a little personal to me.
[03:12:29.120 --> 03:12:35.340]   I get pushback on this, but I think take big risks
[03:12:35.340 --> 03:12:40.340]   and work really hard at whatever you do.
[03:12:40.720 --> 03:12:43.380]   I think you just have to give yourself to a thing.
[03:12:43.380 --> 03:12:45.480]   It doesn't have to be in terms of time,
[03:12:45.480 --> 03:12:46.760]   but really give everything.
[03:12:46.760 --> 03:12:50.500]   So it's not like I'm going to try doing this.
[03:12:50.500 --> 03:12:52.860]   I'll try, I'll try.
[03:12:52.860 --> 03:12:57.280]   Try with all of your heart.
[03:12:57.280 --> 03:12:59.160]   Like really commit yourself.
[03:12:59.160 --> 03:13:01.580]   That doesn't mean necessarily hours, that doesn't mean,
[03:13:01.580 --> 03:13:06.440]   but like if you fail at doing a thing that you commit to,
[03:13:06.440 --> 03:13:08.120]   it should hurt.
[03:13:08.120 --> 03:13:10.020]   So like when I competed in jujitsu,
[03:13:10.020 --> 03:13:12.200]   or you do like sports and so on,
[03:13:12.200 --> 03:13:14.440]   don't just say I'm gonna have fun out there, so on.
[03:13:14.440 --> 03:13:16.240]   No, try to win.
[03:13:16.240 --> 03:13:18.720]   And because then if you don't, it hurts,
[03:13:18.720 --> 03:13:19.920]   and you learn from that.
[03:13:19.920 --> 03:13:22.860]   And then throughout, I think this is a goodness thing,
[03:13:22.860 --> 03:13:23.960]   is be kind.
[03:13:23.960 --> 03:13:28.780]   Some of it is also a skill, allowing yourself to be kind.
[03:13:28.780 --> 03:13:31.720]   I found myself earlier in life, I still do this.
[03:13:31.720 --> 03:13:34.920]   I find when I hang out with people,
[03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:37.000]   people are often cynical and negative.
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:39.480]   - Yeah, I try to avoid those people.
[03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:43.040]   - No, but like, I think everybody falls into that.
[03:13:43.040 --> 03:13:46.440]   And sometimes it's the party norm thing.
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:49.080]   There's a temptation to me to kind of fit in
[03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:51.940]   by being more negative than I'm comfortable being.
[03:13:51.940 --> 03:13:55.960]   And so resist the pressure.
[03:13:55.960 --> 03:13:57.360]   I think especially when you're younger,
[03:13:57.360 --> 03:13:59.920]   it's not cool to care.
[03:13:59.920 --> 03:14:02.120]   - The thing that drives, when you're young,
[03:14:02.120 --> 03:14:07.120]   if you are a fan of a band, a writer, a podcaster, an actor,
[03:14:07.120 --> 03:14:09.200]   and people roll their eyes at you,
[03:14:09.200 --> 03:14:11.240]   watch out, those people are dangerous.
[03:14:11.240 --> 03:14:14.680]   You should have, if you love Avril Lavigne
[03:14:14.680 --> 03:14:17.880]   with her terrible music, and she gives you joy,
[03:14:17.880 --> 03:14:20.440]   and people crap on you, they're wrong and you're right.
[03:14:20.440 --> 03:14:24.000]   So hold on to those things that make you happy.
[03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:25.600]   And if people wanna take that away from you,
[03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:27.880]   or how can you like that?
[03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:30.320]   Those people are not your friends.
[03:14:30.320 --> 03:14:33.720]   - Why do you have to go make life so complicated?
[03:14:35.800 --> 03:14:40.000]   - She's my favorite musician of all time.
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:42.200]   Jimi Hendrix second, Avril Lavigne first.
[03:14:42.200 --> 03:14:46.560]   Thank you for almost bringing a deer to my eye.
[03:14:46.560 --> 03:14:49.440]   You mentioned the should-os in terms of love,
[03:14:49.440 --> 03:14:51.680]   and you should have kids by now.
[03:14:51.680 --> 03:14:53.400]   I apologize if it's a personal one,
[03:14:53.400 --> 03:14:56.560]   but I think at least I have this thought.
[03:14:56.560 --> 03:14:58.260]   And not from society, but from myself.
[03:14:58.260 --> 03:15:00.460]   Like I wanna get married, I wanna have kids.
[03:15:00.460 --> 03:15:03.440]   Do you feel the pressure of that?
[03:15:03.440 --> 03:15:04.920]   Do you wanna have kids?
[03:15:04.920 --> 03:15:06.600]   - I don't wanna have kids.
[03:15:06.600 --> 03:15:07.920]   - You wanna get married?
[03:15:07.920 --> 03:15:09.520]   - I do wanna get married.
[03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:13.320]   This was an issue that I had to kind of work out
[03:15:13.320 --> 03:15:17.400]   earlier this year in terms of the possibility
[03:15:17.400 --> 03:15:20.960]   of having kids, 'cause I was in a relationship
[03:15:20.960 --> 03:15:22.920]   with someone who would have been, in many ways,
[03:15:22.920 --> 03:15:25.440]   literally a perfect mom.
[03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:29.040]   So I did my due diligence, and I actually sat down
[03:15:29.040 --> 03:15:31.480]   with friends of mine who had kids,
[03:15:31.480 --> 03:15:33.180]   and I say, "Give me the downside."
[03:15:34.560 --> 03:15:36.000]   - You did the pros and the cons.
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:36.840]   - Well, the pros I knew.
[03:15:36.840 --> 03:15:39.600]   The pros for kids are very, I love kids.
[03:15:39.600 --> 03:15:42.800]   I was just with Frank Fleming, he writes for the Babylon Bee,
[03:15:42.800 --> 03:15:44.720]   and he had his four kids, and his youngest son
[03:15:44.720 --> 03:15:47.740]   has Down syndrome, which is adorable.
[03:15:47.740 --> 03:15:49.200]   Winchester's so cute.
[03:15:49.200 --> 03:15:52.320]   And I always get along with kids.
[03:15:52.320 --> 03:15:57.720]   I remember very vividly what it was like to be a kid,
[03:15:57.720 --> 03:16:00.000]   especially a precocious kid, and I remember
[03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:02.960]   how much it bothered me when my parents' friends
[03:16:02.960 --> 03:16:05.600]   wouldn't give me attention, so I always make it a point
[03:16:05.600 --> 03:16:07.600]   to acknowledge kids, to talk to them,
[03:16:07.600 --> 03:16:11.600]   and they're very grateful, and it's just really fun.
[03:16:11.600 --> 03:16:13.480]   Especially the people who I'm friends with,
[03:16:13.480 --> 03:16:14.880]   their kids are probably gonna be pretty cool.
[03:16:14.880 --> 03:16:16.840]   They're not gonna be annoying and kind of ugly
[03:16:16.840 --> 03:16:20.000]   and overweight. (Lex laughs)
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:23.200]   So I-- - I love you got that in there.
[03:16:23.200 --> 03:16:25.100]   Okay, good. - Yeah, sorry, I'll go.
[03:16:25.100 --> 03:16:27.920]   But-- - But the cons,
[03:16:27.920 --> 03:16:30.800]   the negatives, what was the conversation like about that?
[03:16:30.800 --> 03:16:33.400]   - Well, I talked, my sister has two kids,
[03:16:33.400 --> 03:16:34.840]   my nephews, who I absolutely adore,
[03:16:34.840 --> 03:16:39.240]   whatever their names are, and she was,
[03:16:39.240 --> 03:16:40.400]   she was saying certain things.
[03:16:40.400 --> 03:16:43.200]   It's like, if I had kids, my kids are in my top priority.
[03:16:43.200 --> 03:16:45.720]   - Yeah. - It's not even a question.
[03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:48.520]   And I feel like the work I'm doing,
[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:50.700]   and this sounds pompous, but it's true,
[03:16:50.700 --> 03:16:53.640]   is A, valuable and important,
[03:16:53.640 --> 03:16:55.520]   but I'm also the only one doing it.
[03:16:55.520 --> 03:17:00.160]   So this is a big cost, and so it's like,
[03:17:00.160 --> 03:17:04.160]   it would be a major lifestyle readjustment.
[03:17:04.160 --> 03:17:07.000]   And I'm at the point where I'm kind of selfish enough
[03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.960]   that I wouldn't want to do that,
[03:17:09.960 --> 03:17:11.720]   and also it'd have to be with the right woman.
[03:17:11.720 --> 03:17:14.120]   Like, you're making a commitment, you know?
[03:17:14.120 --> 03:17:17.400]   And since they're all crazy, you have to find one
[03:17:17.400 --> 03:17:19.440]   where you can handle the crazy.
[03:17:19.440 --> 03:17:21.320]   - All women are crazy? - Yeah.
[03:17:21.320 --> 03:17:23.680]   There are one and a halves in a binary world.
[03:17:23.680 --> 03:17:26.800]   - Oh boy, that's not comfortable for me.
[03:17:26.800 --> 03:17:27.680]   - No, sir.
[03:17:28.400 --> 03:17:30.600]   (chuckles)
[03:17:30.600 --> 03:17:32.600]   - But do you feel the pressure in thinking of that?
[03:17:32.600 --> 03:17:34.160]   How much does that weigh on your heart?
[03:17:34.160 --> 03:17:36.520]   Like, so Elon has kids.
[03:17:36.520 --> 03:17:41.520]   I feel like I love everything, and I love stuff I do.
[03:17:41.520 --> 03:17:45.880]   I love the robot over there, just working with robots.
[03:17:45.880 --> 03:17:48.920]   But I do feel the pressure of like,
[03:17:48.920 --> 03:17:56.320]   almost like when there's amazing cuisines
[03:17:56.320 --> 03:17:58.200]   you never tried or something like that,
[03:17:58.200 --> 03:18:00.240]   like, go out there and try it.
[03:18:00.240 --> 03:18:02.800]   Like, you need to put in the work, and I don't know.
[03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:05.840]   Like, life will run away from you,
[03:18:05.840 --> 03:18:07.800]   slip through your fingers before you truly get
[03:18:07.800 --> 03:18:09.560]   to experience this other kind of love,
[03:18:09.560 --> 03:18:14.560]   which is like long-term love for another human being,
[03:18:14.560 --> 03:18:19.520]   which is like marriage, and then love for kids.
[03:18:19.520 --> 03:18:21.920]   Yeah, and it almost makes me sad,
[03:18:21.920 --> 03:18:26.400]   like not getting to experience that.
[03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:30.920]   You know, 'cause I'm also really scared of,
[03:18:30.920 --> 03:18:34.560]   I've seen so many bad stories on the partner side,
[03:18:34.560 --> 03:18:35.800]   like being with the wrong person.
[03:18:35.800 --> 03:18:36.920]   - Right.
[03:18:36.920 --> 03:18:40.040]   - That to me is, I'm not worried, I have kids all day.
[03:18:40.040 --> 03:18:41.320]   In fact, I could probably just have kids
[03:18:41.320 --> 03:18:42.940]   without the partner.
[03:18:42.940 --> 03:18:47.200]   Kids, I think, are incredible.
[03:18:47.200 --> 03:18:50.880]   But the partner, like a wife,
[03:18:50.880 --> 03:18:53.800]   it seems like she could then have the negative consequences
[03:18:53.800 --> 03:18:56.120]   for you as a writer on your productivity
[03:18:56.120 --> 03:18:57.760]   and your mental ability to flourish,
[03:18:57.760 --> 03:19:00.520]   of being a joy to others, all those kinds of things.
[03:19:00.520 --> 03:19:02.760]   - You know what, that couldn't happen,
[03:19:02.760 --> 03:19:04.900]   because every relationship I've had,
[03:19:04.900 --> 03:19:10.800]   they've been very, beyond supportive.
[03:19:10.800 --> 03:19:14.880]   Like, they'd rather take an hour and do your work
[03:19:14.880 --> 03:19:15.800]   than spend time with me.
[03:19:15.800 --> 03:19:17.440]   Like, I believe in what you're doing.
[03:19:17.440 --> 03:19:19.760]   So I couldn't even casually date someone
[03:19:19.760 --> 03:19:21.160]   who didn't believe that, yeah.
[03:19:21.160 --> 03:19:22.280]   - So that's energizing.
[03:19:22.280 --> 03:19:23.120]   - Yes.
[03:19:23.120 --> 03:19:25.160]   - But over time, you never know how that evolves
[03:19:25.160 --> 03:19:26.560]   and all those kinds of things.
[03:19:26.560 --> 03:19:29.240]   And for me, I think we're a little bit different.
[03:19:29.240 --> 03:19:31.000]   I mean, that has to do with the engineering thing.
[03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:32.840]   I just have to pull insane hours.
[03:19:32.840 --> 03:19:33.920]   - Yeah, I don't.
[03:19:33.920 --> 03:19:35.440]   I work like two hours a day.
[03:19:35.440 --> 03:19:37.360]   - But that's what creatives do.
[03:19:37.360 --> 03:19:40.280]   You can only work a couple hours, honestly,
[03:19:40.280 --> 03:19:43.800]   to be productive, and the rest of the time not.
[03:19:43.800 --> 03:19:46.360]   I have to do a lot of menial labor.
[03:19:46.360 --> 03:19:49.440]   And so there, there's legit tension
[03:19:49.440 --> 03:19:52.000]   on terms of time and attention, all those kinds of things.
[03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:53.640]   I don't know.
[03:19:53.640 --> 03:19:54.920]   Do you think about this stuff a lot,
[03:19:54.920 --> 03:19:58.280]   or do you just love life and do cool stuff,
[03:19:58.280 --> 03:19:59.480]   and whatever happens, happens?
[03:19:59.480 --> 03:20:03.000]   - I have been so blessed for so long now
[03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:05.240]   that I'm at the point where I don't think about it,
[03:20:05.240 --> 03:20:08.560]   and I'm like, you know, just like,
[03:20:08.560 --> 03:20:11.900]   miracles happen every day, so just be open to it.
[03:20:13.160 --> 03:20:16.480]   - You think about your death, mortality?
[03:20:16.480 --> 03:20:18.040]   - Yes.
[03:20:18.040 --> 03:20:19.520]   - Fear, what do you feel about it?
[03:20:19.520 --> 03:20:20.480]   - I'm just worried.
[03:20:20.480 --> 03:20:24.040]   I wanna take as many people out with me as possible.
[03:20:24.040 --> 03:20:25.760]   So, suitcase nuke. - What's the best way?
[03:20:25.760 --> 03:20:28.000]   Nuke, suitcase nuke, I'm thinking.
[03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:28.840]   - Yeah.
[03:20:28.840 --> 03:20:29.840]   - No, I do think-- - In New York,
[03:20:29.840 --> 03:20:33.840]   that would be kind of ironic,
[03:20:33.840 --> 03:20:35.360]   as my other favorite artist would say.
[03:20:35.360 --> 03:20:36.660]   - I think about my legacy,
[03:20:36.660 --> 03:20:40.440]   and that's why my books are so important to me.
[03:20:41.600 --> 03:20:45.320]   - So, do you think of it as a kind of immortality?
[03:20:45.320 --> 03:20:46.160]   - It is, though.
[03:20:46.160 --> 03:20:47.880]   - Like, that's who you are, is those books.
[03:20:47.880 --> 03:20:50.560]   - Well, it's not who I am, but my legacy certainly is.
[03:20:50.560 --> 03:20:53.180]   - What do you hope your legacy is?
[03:20:53.180 --> 03:21:00.560]   - That I encourage people to be hopeful,
[03:21:00.560 --> 03:21:03.020]   and that I taught them how to be free.
[03:21:03.020 --> 03:21:08.880]   And my favorite, I think the best show of all time,
[03:21:08.880 --> 03:21:11.520]   was "Dallas," which often gets,
[03:21:11.520 --> 03:21:12.920]   it was like an '80s soap opera,
[03:21:12.920 --> 03:21:15.040]   and people conflate it with "Dynasty,"
[03:21:15.040 --> 03:21:16.040]   and they think it's trashy,
[03:21:16.040 --> 03:21:17.760]   and it was very Shakespearean,
[03:21:17.760 --> 03:21:20.080]   because all the characters are motivated by different values
[03:21:20.080 --> 03:21:22.600]   and the writing is just masterful,
[03:21:22.600 --> 03:21:24.560]   and the acting is masterful.
[03:21:24.560 --> 03:21:26.720]   And I'm not gonna spoil anything.
[03:21:26.720 --> 03:21:30.600]   One season ended with one of the characters
[03:21:30.600 --> 03:21:32.360]   on their deathbed in the hospital,
[03:21:32.360 --> 03:21:33.360]   and the whole cast is there,
[03:21:33.360 --> 03:21:35.000]   and the amount of acting talent in that room
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:37.640]   is just phenomenal.
[03:21:38.480 --> 03:21:41.440]   And as the character's dying,
[03:21:41.440 --> 03:21:43.480]   they look around and they go,
[03:21:43.480 --> 03:21:46.160]   like, "Please be kind to one another, be a family."
[03:21:46.160 --> 03:21:47.680]   And they're yelling at this character,
[03:21:47.680 --> 03:21:49.240]   "Don't you dare die on me," you know?
[03:21:49.240 --> 03:21:51.480]   And you could see the actors,
[03:21:51.480 --> 03:21:52.560]   'cause they're losing their castmate
[03:21:52.560 --> 03:21:54.200]   who they've had from the beginning.
[03:21:54.200 --> 03:21:55.720]   And it would have been a perfect ending to the show,
[03:21:55.720 --> 03:21:58.180]   but obviously it's a cash cow, they gotta keep milking it.
[03:21:58.180 --> 03:22:01.600]   And I think that kindness and tenderness,
[03:22:01.600 --> 03:22:03.360]   and this is Michael Malice talking,
[03:22:04.440 --> 03:22:08.000]   there's a lot of people who want to make it
[03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:11.120]   that if you are kind or tender,
[03:22:11.120 --> 03:22:14.120]   you're gonna have consequences, bad consequences.
[03:22:14.120 --> 03:22:16.700]   And I think it's important, for me at least,
[03:22:16.700 --> 03:22:19.240]   to create a space in my life
[03:22:19.240 --> 03:22:23.640]   that if someone is going to be nice or friendly or kind,
[03:22:23.640 --> 03:22:27.440]   that they're not gonna have to feel stupid or bad about it.
[03:22:27.440 --> 03:22:29.800]   It's such a disincentive,
[03:22:29.800 --> 03:22:31.400]   the set of structure's so different.
[03:22:31.400 --> 03:22:33.520]   If you wanna be cynical and sneering,
[03:22:33.520 --> 03:22:34.840]   like round of applause,
[03:22:34.840 --> 03:22:36.600]   but if someone says, "Oh, this is great,"
[03:22:36.600 --> 03:22:39.020]   like, okay, simp, it's really bad.
[03:22:39.020 --> 03:22:42.520]   - Well, I think you do just this.
[03:22:42.520 --> 03:22:46.040]   You do this today, you do this in our friendship,
[03:22:46.040 --> 03:22:48.240]   and you do it for a very large number of people,
[03:22:48.240 --> 03:22:51.040]   is teach them how to have hope.
[03:22:51.040 --> 03:22:51.880]   - Yes.
[03:22:51.880 --> 03:22:55.240]   - And teach them how to be free.
[03:22:55.240 --> 03:22:59.200]   So, (speaking in foreign language)
[03:22:59.200 --> 03:23:00.200]   - (speaking in foreign language)
[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:01.040]   - (speaking in foreign language)
[03:23:01.040 --> 03:23:02.720]   Thank you so much for talking to me.
[03:23:02.720 --> 03:23:05.680]   Thank you so much for being an inspiration.
[03:23:05.680 --> 03:23:06.520]   I love you, brother.
[03:23:06.520 --> 03:23:07.340]   - I love you.
[03:23:07.340 --> 03:23:10.440]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:23:10.440 --> 03:23:11.680]   with Michael Malice.

[03:23:17.720 --> 03:23:19.120]   from Albert Camus.
[03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:23.280]   "Don't walk in front of me, I may not follow.
[03:23:23.280 --> 03:23:26.080]   "Don't walk behind me, I may not lead.
[03:23:26.080 --> 03:23:27.500]   "Walk beside me.
[03:23:27.500 --> 03:23:29.120]   "Just be my friend."
[03:23:29.120 --> 03:23:31.120]   Thank you for listening,
[03:23:31.120 --> 03:23:33.400]   and hope to see you next time.
[03:23:33.400 --> 03:23:35.980]   (upbeat music)
[03:23:35.980 --> 03:23:38.560]   (upbeat music)
