[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   - It was really shocking to me
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.940]   that nobody else was doing anything creative with sex work.
[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.440]   Like for me, it was like breathing.
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.820]   Like you're just doing sex and you're bored.
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.660]   I'm like, what do you do?
[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.480]   I don't know, let's try something funny.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.680]   Like it's just the natural progression.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.200]   And it felt to me like there was almost no competition.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.480]   Like I would just be really creative
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.360]   and like immediately it was the top
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.640]   not safe for work post on Reddit.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.840]   I'm like, well, I didn't even try that hard.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.480]   - The following is a conversation with Ayla,
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.960]   a sex researcher who does some of the largest
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.640]   human sexuality survey studies in the world
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.720]   on everything from fetishes to relationships.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.040]   She's fearless in pursuing her curiosity on these topics
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.960]   by asking challenging and fascinating questions
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.360]   and looking for answers in a rigorous data-driven way
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.360]   and writing about it on her blog, knowingless.com.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.200]   She's also a sex worker, including OnlyFans and Escorting
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.000]   and is an exceptionally prolific creator
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.200]   of thought-provoking Twitter polls.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.440]   Ayla and I disagree on a bunch of things,
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.020]   but that just made this conversation even more interesting.
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.680]   I like interesting people in the full range
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.000]   of the meaning that the word interesting implies.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.140]   I'm currently reading "On the Road" by Jack Kerouac
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.340]   and would be remiss if I didn't mention
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.520]   one of my favorite quotes from that book
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.960]   that feels relevant here.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.960]   "The only people for me are the mad ones.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.080]   The ones who are mad to live, mad to talk,
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.240]   mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.320]   The ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing,
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.280]   but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow Roman candles,
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.360]   exploding like spiders across the stars.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.720]   In the middle, you see the blue center light pop
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.440]   and everybody goes, ah."
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.280]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.180]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.360]   in the description.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.360]   And now, dear friends, here's Ayla.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.520]   I feel like this conversation can go anywhere.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.120]   Is that exciting or terrifying to you?
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.400]   - I think it's more exciting.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.800]   - The uncertainty exciting to you?
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.120]   - Yes.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.480]   - In conversations in general or just this one?
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.080]   - I think conversations in general.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.920]   Like, is anybody like,
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.220]   "Oh, the certainty is really exciting."
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.880]   Maybe if the certainty is something new.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.940]   - I mean, novelty always comes with uncertainty, right?
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.040]   Almost always.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.560]   - I started trying to think of a counter example.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.680]   - Immediately. - Yeah.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680]   - Your uncomfortable generalizations of that kind.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.240]   - Like, always is always a really bold word to use.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.360]   - But if it's truly novel,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.320]   that means you don't really understand it.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.880]   It's outside your distribution.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.520]   So therefore, it's gonna have a bunch of uncertainty.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.200]   But you don't think of it as uncertainty.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.280]   You think about it as something new,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.560]   but it actually also attracts you
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.280]   because there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding it,
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.160]   probably.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.520]   Like, what is this new thing?
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.960]   - Yeah, like annihilating the mystery, like that drive.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.200]   - What about the danger of it?
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.560]   - It's like part, I was just thinking of on the drive over,
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.800]   'cause I was like, I'm a little nervous
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.560]   about doing this podcast.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.520]   And then I was feeling into the unpleasantness of it,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.480]   like the fear of what if something goes terribly wrong.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.960]   And then I was also feeling into how much that feels
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.280]   like part of why it's exciting.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.280]   If I knew that it was going to go great, I don't know.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.600]   - Did you actually imagine all the possible ways
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.840]   it can go wrong?
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.880]   - Not like all of them, but I was like,
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.440]   what if I say something really dumb?
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.080]   Or like, you ask me a question and I answer it in a way
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.900]   that makes me sound a lot less capable than I am.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.920]   I'm like really afraid of being perceived as stupid
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.800]   or something.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.080]   I was also thinking about this on the way over,
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.720]   like I'm kind of risk averse in some ways.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.840]   Like I don't like driving fast in cars,
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.160]   'cause I was driving very carefully here
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.640]   'cause the roads are bad.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.520]   And then I was thinking, but I'm very like pro-risk
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.840]   in other ways, like being really exposed
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.400]   to like a wide variety of people who might hate you.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.900]   And I think like from the outside, that might look fine,
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.760]   but I think the monkey brain is really sensitive
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.920]   to lots of people yelling at you
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.760]   for whatever problems that you seem to have.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.300]   - So that's the big risk you're taking
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.220]   is putting yourself out there as an intellectual,
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.540]   like through your writing,
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.380]   and then a lot of people yelling at you.
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.020]   Is that the worst embarrassment you've experienced?
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.540]   - It's pretty bad, yeah.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.980]   I think the worst embarrassment is if I put something
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.180]   out there that I failed to like be properly skeptical
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.620]   of in myself.
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.420]   And then people are like, oh, we caught this thing
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.380]   that you didn't catch.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.220]   I think that's the biggest terror.
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.200]   - Yeah, from looking at your reading
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.420]   and listening to your interviews,
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.180]   you seem to be very defensive
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.100]   and worried about being a good scientist.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.020]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.460]   - But you're like methodology.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.300]   - Yes.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.580]   - And funny enough, you get attacked on that methodology,
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.020]   even though, you know, I'm a fan of psychology,
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.900]   of like academic psychology,
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.900]   and it's kind of disappointing often
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.540]   how non-rigorous their work is,
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.060]   how small the sample size and so on,
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.140]   and how big and ambitious, over-ambitious
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.820]   the proclamations about results is,
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.560]   especially with the news reports on it.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.300]   Now, you're both the researcher,
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.060]   the scientist, and the reporter, right?
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.180]   So like that's what you have with the blog.
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.140]   Your sample size is often gigantic.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.540]   The methodology is right there.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.380]   The data is right there.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.980]   You provide the data.
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.700]   And then you're like raw and honest
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.140]   with your interpretation of the data.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.220]   Like there's an honesty, authenticity to it.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.980]   So I don't know, it's actually really refreshing.
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.420]   I don't know why people criticize it.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.060]   I think this is what psychologists
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.660]   are probably terrified about being transparent,
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.540]   and transparent in that way is because
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.300]   they'll get attacked for their methodology.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.300]   So they wanna cloak it in a sort of layer of authority.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.140]   Like I'm from this institution.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.020]   It was peer-reviewed.
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.820]   There's kind of all these layers,
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.700]   and I'm also not gonna share the data with you,
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.020]   and I'm also gonna pretend like
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.380]   most psychology studies are not replicable.
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.460]   I'm just going to pretend there's authority to it.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.740]   - I think it works on a lot of people.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.940]   Like from the outside, you're like,
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.540]   ah, the scientists with the white lab coats with credentials,
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.300]   those are the people who are like doing science.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.500]   And like doing science is, you know,
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.580]   you have like fancy terms that other people
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.980]   don't really understand.
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.220]   And to be fair, like I have a lot to learn.
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.860]   I'm still like, I'm self-teaching.
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.900]   I'm like learning through people.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.020]   Learning as I go, I'm definitely not
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.220]   super knowledgeable about this stuff.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.340]   But a lot of what those people are doing in science
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.940]   is not that hard.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.220]   And a lot of people like don't try to learn it
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.660]   because it seems so like elevated.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.020]   And this is one thing that really bothers me.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.180]   I think like everybody can do science.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.380]   Like if you just have this aspect of curiosity,
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.500]   and like you just really want to figure something out,
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.780]   you can go and start, you know,
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.220]   asking people questions, doing surveys,
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.500]   like writing down the answers.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.580]   And then you can go learn how to look at that data
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.340]   in a way that gives you more information about the world.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.580]   Like it's very simple and straightforward.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.780]   If you just approach it humbly and earnestly,
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.500]   and you're like, please, let's figure this out together.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.180]   But people like are, I think, self-crippled in this
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.700]   because they view this as like relegated
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.900]   to the domain of the experts and, you know,
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.300]   the fancy scientists.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.380]   And I think that makes me feel really sad.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.700]   - You're almost attracted to the questions
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.140]   you're not supposed to ask.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.300]   - Oh yeah, also yes.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.860]   Which might contribute to the controversy.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.500]   - Not exclusively probably.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.340]   - Oh no.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.700]   - But you're just not limited by like part of your curiosity
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.660]   asking questions that seem common sense.
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.220]   Like some of the most controversial questions
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.020]   are like around sex.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.420]   It's like everybody thinks and talks and does sex.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.900]   I mean, it's the driver of human civilization.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.700]   And yet there's so little like rigorous discussion
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.180]   about the philosophical
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.860]   and the scientific questions around it.
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.100]   It's like, it gets really weird to be able to discuss them.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.860]   It becomes tricky to discuss them.
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.340]   - Yeah, it's super charged.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.740]   'Cause everybody has a really strong opinion,
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.860]   like whether or not, you know,
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.540]   pornography is damaging to society
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.780]   or like how sex corresponds to gender
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.780]   or like what kind of sexuality is acceptable.
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.020]   Like, can you have sexual preferences
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.780]   that in themselves are immoral?
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.900]   People get very angry about it.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.580]   - Well, the sad part is they're not just opinionated,
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.140]   but most of us, our relationship with sex is,
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.940]   I think, I guess I wanna say not rigorous.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.260]   - I think it's very difficult to be rigorous about sex.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.140]   Like, I would consider sexual urges
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.100]   to be kind of elusive to introspection
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.700]   in a way that's a little bit disproportionate
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.780]   to a lot of other things.
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.220]   Like you could like, you know, introspect about,
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.580]   you know, how I want other people to like me
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.660]   and where my insecurities lie.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.980]   But sex is one of those black box things.
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.740]   A really common thing is for people to,
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.660]   if you have a fetish,
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.660]   you sort of check back in your childhood
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.900]   to see an event that corresponds to that fetish.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.020]   And then you like develop a narrative,
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.460]   like, ah, this event in my childhood
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.940]   must have caused this fetish.
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.700]   And so I think this causes people to be biased
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.340]   towards like a concrete, coherent, causative way
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.900]   that events happen or that sexual fetishes happen.
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.340]   This is just like one example of like why
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.420]   I think it's really hard to be rigorous with introspection.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.260]   'Cause we can't avoid,
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.980]   you just wanna tend towards making like coherent narratives,
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.300]   which I think is not always the correct way to explain it.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.100]   - The narratives that are connected to childhood
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.980]   and so on, how they originate.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.540]   Yeah, you've, I mean, we'll talk about fetishes
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.100]   'cause you have a lot of really interesting writing on that.
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.420]   Just actually zooming out,
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.260]   I shouldn't mention you tweeted, I wrote this down.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.620]   You tweeted, "I do not understand
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.660]   "how to have normal conversations with people in person
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.980]   "if I'm not on drugs."
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.540]   So I guess, let's both agree
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.740]   to not have a normal conversation, I guess.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.500]   Assuming you're not on drugs now.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.860]   Or if you are, you don't have to tell me.
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.180]   - I feel like a very small amount of phenibut,
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.940]   which is a nootropic.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.780]   Don't know if that counts.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.620]   - Is that a drug?
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.940]   Well, I guess I'm on caffeine.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.620]   Yeah. - So we're both--
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.780]   - Drugged up.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.820]   - Good enough to have a normal conversation.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.660]   - We don't have to.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.460]   - What is normal anyway?
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.100]   What do you think is the primary driver
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.540]   of human civilization?
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.540]   Is it the desire for sex, love, power, or immortality?
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.260]   Like avoiding the fear of death,
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.300]   constructing illusions that make us forget
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.940]   about our terror over mortality.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.020]   So sex, love, power, death.
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.740]   - Is this a Twitter poll?
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.060]   - It's-- - There's four options.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.380]   - This is reality.
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.740]   Not everything maps perfectly to a Twitter poll,
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.140]   but in this case, because there's four options
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.620]   and it is a small number of characters, it does.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.060]   But I'd like to think I'm more interested.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.460]   You know what?
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.420]   I think your Twitter polls are fundamentally interesting.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.500]   There's something about the brevity of a poll
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.580]   limiting it to a set of choices
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.060]   and having an existential crisis
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.980]   and searching for the answer.
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.260]   That's beautiful.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.220]   - That combination.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.140]   - Well, this one is a big one.
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.460]   Like, what do you think is behind it?
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.260]   - Do you believe that there is one primary driver?
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.740]   Like, do you think that it can be understood
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.020]   in the terms of primary drivers?
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.140]   - Yeah, I think, well, maybe it's an engineering perspective
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.220]   like trying to reverse engineer the brain.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.860]   I don't think we're equipped or understand enough
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.180]   about the mind to get there.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.740]   - Yeah, like, what's the primary driver of a tree?
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.180]   - Yeah, well, then it gets to the question of what is life?
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.620]   What is a living organism?
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.340]   - Like, to self-replicate, probably.
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.700]   - That's a very clean simplification,
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.700]   but I think life is more interesting
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.580]   than just self-replication.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.980]   - Yeah, but it sounds like there's a curiosity in you
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.180]   that you're trying to poke at,
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.020]   and I don't understand exactly what that curiosity is.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.300]   - So if I had to dedicate 1,000 years
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.620]   to understand one of these topics,
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.260]   which one would be the most fruitful,
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.100]   I guess is the indirect thing I'm asking.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.940]   - Fun?
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.740]   - No, well, fun.
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.420]   To me, everything is fun.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.340]   But-- - Really?
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.300]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm with David Foster Wallace.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.580]   The key to life is to make sure that everything's unboreable
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.540]   or to be unboreable, or nothing is boring.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.500]   Everything is fun.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.260]   Like everything, I could just literally sit.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.700]   I honestly, 'cause I don't think,
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.220]   I don't know where you got that glass,
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.620]   but that glass exists, and I forgot it exists,
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.100]   and it was really fun to me to know that now it was there.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.660]   - What about the really unpleasant things?
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.020]   Like if you're in deep agony?
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.500]   - Yeah, that's fun. - Okay.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.140]   - That's fun, 'cause it's like, yeah, heartbreak.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.060]   It's like knowing that I'm capable of that.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.100]   It's like from, (laughs)
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.140]   you know, we're all living in the gutter,
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.340]   but some of us are looking up at the stars.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.660]   So when you're in that gutter,
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.660]   for some reason, the stars look brighter, right?
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.500]   So like whenever you're going through a difficult time,
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.340]   or whenever you see maybe other people
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.900]   being shitty to each other,
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.020]   it makes you like really appreciate when they're not.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.500]   The contrast makes life kind of amazing.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.620]   I'm reading a bunch of books,
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.060]   and one of them is "Brave New World,"
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:32.060]   where they remove the ups and downs of life,
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.220]   partially through drugs,
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.660]   but over over-sexualization, all that kind of stuff.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:41.660]   And I feel like you need the ups and downs of life.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:46.860]   You need the dark to have happiness,
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.660]   to have like a deeply intense feeling of affection
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.380]   towards another thing or a human being.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.540]   Yeah, yeah, so everything's fun.
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.500]   But fun is also a weird word to define,
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.500]   'cause fun, I think for a lot of people,
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.020]   that's why I talk about love a lot.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.200]   I think love is a better word than fun,
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.940]   'cause fun is like lighthearted.
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.860]   Love is more intense.
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:17.180]   Like I love that glass and the water that's in it,
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.220]   'cause it's fricking awesome.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.620]   Like somebody made that glass, right?
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.580]   And like not have many mistakes,
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.140]   and the way it bends light in interesting ways,
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.460]   and the way water bends light in interesting ways,
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.300]   like I can see part of your arm through that water.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.020]   That's fricking amazing.
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.520]   Everything is amazing.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.980]   I'm with the Lego movie.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.380]   But from a scientific perspective,
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.440]   if I were to investigate sex,
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.660]   I don't know why I put love in there.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.820]   Let's just narrow it down in the Twitter poll.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.340]   Let's focus on the basics here.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.560]   Sex, power, or death, immortality.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.520]   If I were to try to,
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.100]   like from a neuroscience, neurobiology perspective,
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.180]   or reverse engineer through building AI systems
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.740]   that focus on these kinds of dynamics,
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.300]   exploring the game theoretic aspects of it,
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.540]   exploring the sort of cognitive modeling aspects of it,
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.100]   which one would get me to a deeper understanding
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.820]   of the human condition?
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.660]   That's the question.
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.880]   Sex, okay, Nietzsche is the will to power.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.700]   Freud and the bunch is all about sex.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.120]   And then death.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.960]   Liv just, Liv Burley,
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.740]   brilliant previous guest on this podcast,
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.820]   she just released a video where on her bedside
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:41.220]   was the book "Denial of Death" by Ernest Becker,
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.900]   which of course she would have on her bedside.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.340]   But his whole work is that everything is motivated
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.780]   by our trying to escape the cold, harsh reality
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.980]   that we're going to die and we're terrified of it.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.980]   One of the gifts and burdens for human beings
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.700]   is that we are cognizant of our own death.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.980]   And that terrifies us.
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.260]   That's the theory.
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.900]   And because of that, we do everything we can.
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.500]   We build empires to escape the fact that we're mortal.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.340]   - Wouldn't this change quite a bit
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.420]   for religious people then,
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.700]   who don't believe that they're going to die?
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.300]   - Well, they created religion.
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.780]   The idea there is to create myths, religions.
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.780]   You can create religions of all kinds.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.400]   - Yeah, but if this is one of the defining things
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.860]   that defines civilization,
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.820]   then we should expect to see massive differences
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.180]   between people who believe we're gonna die
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.460]   and people who don't.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.300]   - Good, I love it.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.980]   You take it scientifically here.
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.340]   And they have actually answers.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.060]   There's a whole terror management theory
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.020]   where they do write psychology-type papers
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.200]   and they do actual experiments.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.740]   I can mention how their methodology is interesting.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.060]   They prime with the discussion of death.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.220]   They take one certain set of people
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.460]   and have a conversation with them.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.740]   Another set of people, they mention death to them
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.060]   before the conversation and see how that affects
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.220]   the nature of the conversation.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.260]   It's really interesting 'cause death fundamentally alters
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.140]   the nature of the conversation.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.280]   Just even priming,
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.980]   reminding you that you're going to die,
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.660]   briefly, changes a lot of things.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.740]   - These kinds of priming papers are usually not replicated.
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.380]   I just have, I feel like I've heard
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.260]   a bunch of priming ones that--
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.180]   - I think you have PTSD over psychology papers
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.100]   that are not replicated.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.660]   - I just did a priming experiment on my own
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.900]   and found it didn't have any effect.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.740]   But again--
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.860]   - Can't you just give me a careless statement
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.420]   summarizing an entire scientific discipline
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.300]   of terror management theory?
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.120]   I don't know.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.340]   I haven't rigorously looked at
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.780]   how good of it is psychologically.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.980]   I think it is interesting philosophically,
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.020]   the way Freud talked about the subconscious mind,
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.740]   philosophically, it's an interesting discussion.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.580]   Then you have to get rigorous with it, for sure.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.700]   But the idea is that,
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.860]   like it's not that religious people
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.860]   get rid of the terror of death.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.660]   This is just one of the popular ways
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.980]   they create an illusion on top of it.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.180]   That's that idea, like a myth that allows,
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.220]   that makes it easier for them to forget,
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.940]   to escape that terror.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.660]   But everybody else does different methods.
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.540]   You fill your days with,
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.180]   capitalism has a whole religion of itself,
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.740]   like the rat race for getting more
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.900]   and more material possessions and so on.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.700]   - And couldn't you argue it in the opposite direction?
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.820]   Like, let's say, assume that we're Christians here
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.220]   and we're like, oh, the atheists,
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.500]   everybody has terror of hell
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.220]   and the atheists invent this mythology
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.380]   where actually evolution is true
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.580]   in order to escape their terror of hell.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.820]   So that doesn't feel like a persuasive argument to me.
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.900]   But I used to be very, very Christian
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.620]   and I did not have a terror of death.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.740]   And then I lost my faith
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.020]   and then I had a deep terror of death set in for a few years.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.900]   And it felt very different to me.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.700]   - So for denial of death,
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.380]   I don't know if he says that it's actually possible
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:04.060]   without really a lot of work to get to the actual terror.
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.340]   Like, I think his claim is that in early, early,
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.260]   early childhood development,
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.460]   that's when the terror is real.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.700]   And then we aggressively construct systems around it
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:20.340]   of social interaction to sort of construct illusions
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.380]   on top of it.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.860]   I'm doing a half-ass description of this philosophy,
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:29.860]   but it is interesting to simplify the human mind
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:35.300]   into underlying mechanisms that drive it.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.460]   - Yeah, I was gonna say, your thinking seems kind of poetic.
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.020]   Like the way that you're sort of handling these,
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.140]   these concepts feel like more like aesthetically driven.
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.580]   - I think this theme is gonna continue
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.620]   throughout this conversation
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.340]   as we talk about relationships and sex, yes.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.980]   For sure, I think so.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.700]   And I think your thinking seems to be very driven
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.340]   by how can I construct an experiment to test this hypothesis?
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.300]   - Yeah, something like that.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.820]   - Yeah, but aren't, there's some things,
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.180]   especially that have to do with the human mind
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.100]   that are really messy, really difficult to understand.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.540]   There's so many uncertainties and mysteries around
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.340]   that we don't yet have the tools to collect the data.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.780]   Like, one of your favorite tools is the survey,
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.860]   is asking people questions.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.620]   And then figuring out different ways
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.780]   to indirectly get at the truth
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.340]   because there's flaws to the survey.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.900]   You kind of learn about those flaws
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.820]   and you get better and better
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.940]   at asking the right questions and so on.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.300]   But that's not, that's indirect access to the human mind.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.700]   - But do you think poetic narratives are?
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.260]   I'm not saying poetic narratives are bad.
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.980]   I think it's a cool way of handling concepts.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:42.900]   But I'm not sure that they are more rigorous.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.740]   - No, no, no.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.580]   - Okay.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.500]   - No, but they might be the more correct,
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.140]   like philosophy might be the right way
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.220]   to discuss things that were really far from understanding.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.580]   - Yeah, I mean, they might be more useful shorthand.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.420]   - Yeah.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.100]   - Like morality, I don't think morality makes any sense.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.940]   But it's really useful shorthand to use
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.300]   when handling concepts a lot of the time.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.540]   - Right, like ethics and morality.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.180]   You could construct studies that ask different questions.
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.940]   Like, you know, just having worked
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.220]   with autonomous vehicles a lot,
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.380]   the trolley problem gets brought up.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.260]   And I don't know, you can construct all kinds
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.900]   of interesting surveys about the trolley problem.
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:21.460]   But does that really get at some deep moral calculus
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.260]   that humans do?
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.700]   It's sexy because people like write clickbait articles
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.380]   about it, but does it really get to like,
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:34.380]   what you value more, five grandmas or like three children?
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.200]   Whatever, like they construct these arguments of like,
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.520]   if you could steer a train,
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.500]   if you could steer an autonomous car, which do you choose?
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.600]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.660]   I don't know if it's possible
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.840]   with some of those to construct.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.900]   Sometimes the fuzzy area, there's some topics
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.940]   that are fuzzy and will forever be fuzzy,
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.600]   given our limited cognitive capabilities.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.760]   - I don't know, there's a way of looking at things
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.280]   where it's like, for example, the childhood fetish thing
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.120]   that I was talking about,
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.060]   like where do your fetishes come from?
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.900]   Like you can develop a narrative where it's like,
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.940]   I think like this kind of thing is,
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.680]   when you're surrounded by feet when you're a child,
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.260]   this causes foot fetishes.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.300]   And this is like kind of a cool narrative.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.660]   And I think a lot of people's ideas about philosophy
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.780]   follow the same sort of thing.
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.740]   Like, what is the narrative that is cool?
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.240]   And I think this is useful for meaning making.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.340]   Like I'm very pro meaning making.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.560]   Like when you're talking about everything is fun
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.460]   because the contrast or whatever,
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.860]   I very much ascribe to that.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.940]   I really enjoy that philosophy.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.020]   I also find everything to be very delightful.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.620]   And this isn't like a question of truth, right?
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.320]   We're not like, where is the true delight
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.620]   that we're objectively measuring?
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.780]   I guess this is a frame, a poetic frame that you're using
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.500]   to like sort of change the way the light
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.100]   hits the world around you.
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.380]   And that's super useful because it like makes you happier
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.200]   or something.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:54.060]   - Yeah, but also gets to the truth or something.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.660]   - Yeah, I guess if what is true.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.780]   (laughing)
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.580]   Yet another question, what is truth?
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:05.500]   You've, actually to jump back,
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.200]   you believe that free will is an illusion.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:14.700]   So why does it feel like I'm free
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.800]   to make any decision I want?
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.860]   - It's a cool illusion?
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.340]   I think that's probably like where our sense of identity
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.660]   comes from. - It's a fun illusion?
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.980]   - Like when you really meditate on your sense of identity,
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.780]   for at least for me, it seems like it comes down
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.680]   to the sense of choice.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.620]   Like, oh, I am doing the thinking.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.100]   Like, what does it mean to do with thinking?
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.620]   It's like, ah, something in me has exerted agency
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.340]   over having this thought or not having this thought.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.780]   Like the sense of self really comes down to choice.
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.740]   And so when I say that like free will is an illusion,
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.260]   I also mean there's something like the self is an illusion,
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.740]   identity is a trick of the light.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.980]   - But it's a really fun one.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.820]   - Yeah.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.180]   - You think a lot about your identity.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.060]   - I have occasionally.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.820]   - Yeah, like you really struggle with it.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.020]   You're proud of it.
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.340]   I do too.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.860]   We have different journeys, but so.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.340]   - I really take a lot of delight in it.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.940]   I used to be very into like deconstructing it.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.660]   Like maybe you know, I did a bunch of like way too much
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.100]   jealousy for a while.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.780]   And at that point, very no ego.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.420]   And now I'm like very ego.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.900]   I really enjoy having a lot of ego.
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.420]   - I actually happen to know like everything about you.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.260]   - Really? - Yeah.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.500]   - Oh. - Like more than you do.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.380]   It's interesting.
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.220]   - That's fascinating.
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.340]   Wait, could you solve my problems?
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.180]   - Yes, all of them.
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.780]   I did thorough research.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.180]   Okay, what is consciousness then?
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.820]   I actually wrote that as a quote, what is consciousness?
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.900]   (both laughing)
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.140]   To remind myself.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.900]   So like how does that tie in together with free will
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.980]   and identity and all of that?
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.340]   - That's what I thought, what is consciousness
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.460]   is like one of the biggest questions ever.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.820]   I do think that people often get confused
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.660]   when talking about consciousness
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.100]   'cause I think people are referring to two separate concepts
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.380]   and often like combining them into one thing.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.340]   Like we asked the question,
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.460]   is AI going to be conscious?
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.660]   I think this is kind of the wrong question.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.740]   Like we can identify signs of consciousness,
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.980]   like, ah, they seem to refer to themselves.
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.820]   But this is not necessarily proof of consciousness
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.540]   in the same way that like dream characters
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.300]   acting exactly the way normal human people do in your dream
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.180]   is not evidence that they themselves are conscious.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.620]   So like signs of consciousness
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.740]   are not proof of consciousness,
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.780]   but there is something that we definitely know,
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.540]   which is like, I currently am conscious,
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.500]   I can tell because, right.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.860]   Like I'm like just directly observing my experience.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.340]   And so there's one kind of consciousness,
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.420]   which is I am directly observing my experience
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.660]   and that you cannot replicate it.
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.540]   Like I cannot observe two experiences.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.340]   It is necessarily singular and it is necessarily certain.
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.500]   Like you can make all the arguments you want.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.420]   Like I'm still directly observing.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.420]   It's not a thing that's subject to reason.
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.140]   Whereas our other thing is conscious.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:48.500]   This is something that's replicable.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.980]   Like you can apply it to multiple people.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.780]   It's something that's not certain,
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.300]   like almost definitionally not certain.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.260]   Like we don't actually know
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.560]   if there is an internal experience.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.260]   So my argument is that like when people are talking
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.060]   about other things having experience,
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.700]   they're using a different concept
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.600]   than the thing that they're actually looking at
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.980]   when they look at their own experience.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.360]   I think they're two different things.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.060]   - Definitionally not possible.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.140]   No, if you understand the mechanism of consciousness,
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.900]   you'll be able to measure it probably, right?
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.460]   - Yeah, but what are you measuring?
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.600]   Like I think there's just like a subtle difference.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.820]   Like when you're asking the question,
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.020]   is this other thing conscious?
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.980]   - Yeah, the easy thing to measure is like a survey.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.380]   Does this thing appear conscious?
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.220]   - Yeah.
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.780]   - And then the hard thing is you understand
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.300]   the actual mechanism of how consciousness arises
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.020]   in the physics of the human brain.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.460]   - Yeah, but you can do that in a dream, presumably.
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.580]   Like if you had a very good dream or a very good simulation.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.400]   - Yeah.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.660]   - But we could then have somebody in a simulation
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.700]   or a dream where they go through and they fully understand.
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.900]   You know, they do all the tests
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.940]   and the tests come back exactly the way you'd expect them to.
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.940]   But from the outside, we're like, well, this is misleading.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.740]   They're not actually conscious.
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.060]   Like your dream characters aren't conscious, right?
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:54.900]   Probably.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:55.740]   - I don't know, are you asking?
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.560]   Are you telling?
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.900]   - I'm like appealing to an intuition.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.300]   (both laughing)
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.380]   - But it sounds like you're driving towards a narrative.
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.140]   You did a poll about men and women and dreams.
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:04.980]   - Yeah.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.000]   - Those are some kind of difference.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.300]   I couldn't tell what the difference was
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.820]   except that more men than women.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.860]   - Quite a lot more women dream vividly than men.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:12.700]   - Oh.
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.540]   - Which I actually found in my chaos survey.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.180]   So I did a survey, maybe you know the,
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.020]   I just had a people--
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:17.860]   - I know everything, do you remember?
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.020]   - You do know, yes, I'm sorry.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.100]   So as you clearly know.
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.180]   - I'll try not to talk down to you through this conversation
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.020]   'cause I know. - I'm sorry.
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.900]   - And I not only know everything,
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.220]   I know how your future looks like.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.060]   - Really?
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.820]   - And how everything ends, yeah.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.520]   - So you could probably win all the prediction markets
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.380]   on my life.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.220]   - Yeah.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.040]   - Cool.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:34.880]   - So we should also mention
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.460]   that you have like prediction markets.
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.420]   You have like votes.
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.500]   The, what's the site called again?
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.340]   - Manifold.
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.180]   - Manifold.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.340]   And one of them was, will I be on the Lex Friedman podcast?
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.180]   - Yeah.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.180]   - And I voted.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.540]   I invested everything I owned into the yes.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.780]   Is there such thing as insider trading on there?
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.820]   'Cause that goes against the terms of the--
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.700]   - No, I think insider trading is part of the information.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:58.540]   So it's supposed to be.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.380]   - Oh, I see.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.100]   And then I realized it's actually public information
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:01.940]   that I voted.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.260]   'Cause like, I think my face shows up there,
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.580]   it's like, damn it.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.420]   It's gonna influence--
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.980]   - Make a fake account.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.180]   - You could make the fake account.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.900]   Or I could be lying, right?
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:11.740]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.580]   - And dump the stock or whatever.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.860]   - You know, I try to manipulate,
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.020]   somebody made a market like,
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.580]   is Ayla going to post a poll,
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.140]   spelled P-O-L-E on her Twitter, like a photo.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.380]   And I was like, I'm gonna manipulate this market.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.300]   So I like fucked around with it and I voted no.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.020]   And then I accidentally posted a photo of a poll
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:26.860]   without thinking.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.980]   - Oh, but that's like self-sabotage.
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.980]   - Yeah, I accidentally fucked up my own market.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.420]   - That doesn't, that's like the reverse of insider trading.
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.260]   - Yeah.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.080]   - What were we talking about?
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.340]   Oh, the women and the men and the difference,
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.740]   the vivid dreams and the markets.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.580]   If you go with the market,
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.100]   oh, 'cause I can perfectly predict your future.
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:44.980]   But then it's not fun.
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.700]   I like the romance of unpredictability.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.020]   And so I like to, even though I know everything,
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.420]   I like to forget everything.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.980]   - Very, very Buddhist of you.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.060]   - Yeah, the river.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.100]   No man in the river wants whatever,
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.500]   the footsteps, however that goes.
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.100]   - That's one of my favorite questions,
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.580]   is like, if you could press a button
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.900]   and then have all of your wants fulfilled,
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.900]   anything that you want.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.340]   So it's like such a rapid degree
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.180]   that you don't really experience the want.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.500]   Like as the want arises,
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.660]   it then is like completed as immediately
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.580]   so that you are completely without want.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.580]   Like, would you press that button?
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.420]   - 100% not.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.260]   - Yeah, I didn't think you would.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.780]   - No, no, no.
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.260]   Because immediately everything stops being fun.
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.700]   The first, it's only fun the first time.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.140]   - But if you want it to be fun.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.860]   - But like, what would be my source of fun?
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.940]   I feel like I would, like on day four,
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.780]   just to get off,
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.900]   I would need to like do like nuclear war
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.300]   'cause it'll escalate quickly.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.620]   (both laughing)
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.780]   I feel like if everything is possible,
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.060]   I assume you mean like something that like,
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.700]   is not just normal human things.
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.660]   - Yeah, magical world.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.580]   - Magical world.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.260]   Then you start escalating really quickly.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.460]   Like, I wonder, I'll probably do like,
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.500]   I want everybody to just fly into the air
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.620]   and hover in the air.
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.260]   Everybody.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.540]   And then you're like, oh, life is meaningless.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.060]   Like, why does, like you go,
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.180]   I feel like you get,
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:09.100]   no, I actually, that'd be a really interesting experiment.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.980]   Like, what are the limits?
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.060]   Like, are we all capable of becoming psychopaths essentially?
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.500]   Like, I'd like to believe not.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.980]   There's a very hard limits on that,
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.660]   like in our own mind, like of basic compassion.
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.740]   'Cause I love being compassionate
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.020]   towards other human beings.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.140]   And it's one of the things I think about
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.180]   if you give me power, like a lot of power,
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.500]   like absolute power.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.300]   And I think that's the power you mentioned
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.900]   is the scariest kind of power.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.460]   'Cause it's like, it's not even power in this normal world.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.860]   It's like magical power where you lose,
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.100]   it's a dream world power where you,
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.260]   like video game power,
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.060]   you don't even think of it as reality.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.660]   You could just mess with the world.
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.460]   I feel like that's terrifying.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.580]   - Yeah, you'd basically be God.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:54.620]   - God, yeah.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:59.460]   But without like, I feel like the idea of God
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:04.020]   wants to like, keep things like functioning properly.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:04.940]   - But then you'd probably,
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.260]   if you wanted to keep them functioning properly,
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.820]   then it would rapidly,
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.540]   like you would never experience a time where you're like,
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.540]   "Oh no, that was a mistake."
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.700]   Because as soon as you, like before you even experienced that
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.140]   the world would shift to match it.
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.060]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.940]   No, I think I would actually, I take it back.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.120]   I think I would regret the first time I hurt somebody.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.780]   See, in my visualization was like a video game
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.020]   where everybody's like NPC, really dumb.
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:33.460]   No, I think the first time I witnessed pain from anybody,
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.780]   that's when I would stop.
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.180]   And I would probably run into that very quickly.
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:41.900]   Like even just the hovering, make a person hover,
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.540]   and they're gonna be probably really upset
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.820]   with the hovering, right?
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.980]   And so I'm gonna be like, "No, don't do that anymore."
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:48.820]   And then I'll probably go to,
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.320]   honestly, I'll just return back to my normal life.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.500]   - Yeah, that's kind of what I feel like.
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.220]   Like if I had the power to do anything,
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.300]   I think I would probably want to have a life
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.380]   very similar to where I am now.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.140]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's like with Uber,
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.740]   like it'd be probably more convenient to do certain things.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.300]   But even then, like the struggle,
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.740]   like I got a flat tire, so I have to fix that.
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:17.740]   I kind of, the flat tire makes everything more beautiful.
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:21.540]   It's like, cool, I could do like a normal manual thing.
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:24.460]   But also it makes you like appreciate your car,
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.860]   appreciate transportation, appreciate the convenience
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.660]   of transportation, all of it.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.140]   - I know some people who would like call this
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.980]   a bunch of copium, like you're just sort of making do
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:34.800]   with what you have.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.660]   Like we wouldn't go back to Amish times or like pre-technology
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.380]   because to like, in order to make ourselves
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.700]   appreciate things more.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.860]   And so it seems like a hindsight reasoning,
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.220]   which like I can appreciate that argument,
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.860]   but I don't know.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:49.860]   I'm like, I kind of-
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.380]   - Anyone who uses, sorry to interrupt the word copium
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:57.380]   in their argumentation, I think is sus.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.420]   - Is sus. - Yeah.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.860]   - Is sus my entire argument is now.
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.700]   - No, I'm just kidding.
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.740]   Go ahead, sorry.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.620]   I interrupted rudely the flow of thought,
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.380]   but you don't think so?
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.820]   In part, you disagree with that kind of argument?
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.940]   - Yeah, 'cause I think people have this idea
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:20.740]   that if you like come to accept or like find meaning
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.700]   in what you have now, this is sort of at odds
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.820]   with trying to improve it.
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.980]   And I don't find this to be the case.
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.540]   I find like the attempt to improve it to also be part of it.
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.740]   Like I enjoy the fact that there's something
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.540]   like problematic going on because now I get the experience
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.780]   of like striving to make it go away.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.860]   And like that in itself is where the meaning lies.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.020]   It's not just that things are bad,
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:41.980]   it's that there's things are bad
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.300]   and we're trying to stop it and also.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.740]   - Exactly.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.740]   If you combine that with a sense of optimism
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:49.140]   that the future can be better, yeah,
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.460]   that feeds into this productive effort
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.660]   of making things better.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.820]   And it somehow makes the vision of the things
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.780]   that are better more intense,
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.140]   having experienced shitty things.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:02.980]   - Yeah.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:07.220]   - So we talked about free will and consciousness
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.340]   and what drives human civilization.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.860]   Question left unanswered.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.700]   It's a homework problem for the reader.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.540]   Okay.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.100]   Let's--
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.340]   - Can we have a scoreboard at the end?
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.780]   The amount of questions?
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:21.620]   - The answer?
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.020]   - Completed successfully versus not?
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:23.980]   - Like polls.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.820]   - Yeah.
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.260]   - Can we talk about some practical things?
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.100]   - Sure.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.620]   - So one of the many amazing things,
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.900]   I think of you as a researcher,
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.900]   but you've also been doing research in the field.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.380]   - Yeah, fieldwork.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.220]   - Fieldwork.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.380]   - The Jane Goodall of--
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.820]   (laughing)
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.660]   - Yeah, right.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.940]   - The sex work.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.260]   - How did you get,
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.060]   what's the short and the long story
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.740]   of how you got into sex work?
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.860]   - How did I get into sex work?
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:54.180]   Well, I mean, there's a whole like childhood thing
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.580]   where I was conservatively homeschooled.
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.620]   - Do you wanna actually talk about your childhood?
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.460]   I think it's interesting
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.620]   'cause you also worked at a factory.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.500]   So like your childhood is really fascinating
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.780]   and difficult, traumatic.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.220]   So, and you've written about it.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.900]   There's a lot of ways we could talk about it,
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:16.540]   but maybe what are the things you remember
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.380]   the good and the bad of your childhood,
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.020]   of your maybe interaction with your father?
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.860]   - Yeah, my dad probably has narcissistic personality disorder
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.260]   and so it was very centered on,
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.260]   very controlling childhood, immensely so.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.380]   We were homeschooled
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.140]   and pretty isolated from the outside world.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:36.100]   Like we didn't know anybody else who wasn't homeschooled.
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.660]   We went through a program called Growing Kids God's Way,
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.900]   which was very,
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.940]   it was like the kind of program
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.220]   where you're not supposed to pick up babies
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.340]   when they cry to train them
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.180]   that they can't manipulate the parents
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:48.100]   because like baby crying was viewed as like,
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.580]   you're just teaching them from an early age
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.260]   that they're allowed to make the parents do
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.620]   what the kids want.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.460]   And we're very against this philosophy.
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.260]   So, that combined with a narcissistic personality disorder,
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.620]   dad was pretty rough.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.860]   - So controlling.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:02.900]   - Super controlling, yeah.
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.420]   - And developing and feeding the self-critical aspect
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.740]   of your brain.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:07.660]   - Yeah, very much.
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.780]   It was, I was like lazy,
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.260]   I was never gonna accomplish anything in life.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.300]   I was gonna move out of the house
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.820]   and realize how good I had it at home,
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.860]   you know, the classic stuff.
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:17.900]   He was very like logical and smart though.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.940]   And so he'd also like teach us logic stuff.
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.500]   I remember some of my earliest memories
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.460]   are him like giving me basic logic puzzles.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.300]   Like the dog has three legs,
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.660]   you know how many dogs have four legs
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.540]   and I would mess up.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.700]   But he was an evangelist,
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.180]   basically a Christian evangelist.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.980]   So we did like Bible study five nights a week.
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.580]   I memorized, I think 800 verses of the Bible
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.460]   by the time before I became an adult.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:46.220]   Yeah, and it was very patriarchal also.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.540]   So I was expected to grow up and become a housewife,
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.380]   basically, they're like,
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.780]   oh, you can go to college to meet a man
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.060]   and also to get a little bit of education
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.020]   so that you can homeschool your own kids.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.420]   Like we were explicitly told
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.380]   that women were subordinate to men
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.340]   in regards to like making decisions when you're married.
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.140]   Our pastor's daughter was not allowed to leave home
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.780]   because she would be outside of the authority of a man.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.540]   So when she got married, she was allowed to leave
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.300]   'cause she was never allowed to live in a house
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.900]   where she was not under a hierarchy.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.940]   So this is like the kind of culture that we live in.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.460]   - So there's a hierarchy
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.980]   and there's a gender aspect to the hierarchy.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.260]   There's men at the top of that hierarchy.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.660]   - Men at the top.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.020]   - Okay, but your own psychology, your own mind.
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:30.580]   So most of that self-critical brain is bad, right?
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.580]   - It's confusing 'cause he told me that I was smart,
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.660]   but also that I would fail.
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.500]   But I think--
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.060]   - But not smart enough, right?
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.380]   Or like smart, but not smart enough.
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.700]   - Smart, but like not virtuous or something.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.220]   - Okay, so there's, okay, right.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.220]   There's always a flaw.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.540]   - Yeah, there's always a flaw.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.700]   I think a lot of it was,
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.820]   a lot of the fucked upness of my brain
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.340]   came from feeling like I didn't have the authority to think
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:56.020]   'cause it was so carefully suppressed.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.700]   My ability to express or have any sort of power
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.620]   was just absolutely annihilated, systemically.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.660]   Psychologically, they would do
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.500]   psychological torture mechanisms
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.660]   to make sure that I wasn't actually thinking on my own
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:11.340]   or being able to deviate from anything anybody ever told me.
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.420]   To the degree that it still ingrained in me,
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.060]   I once was with a friend, we were traveling,
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.700]   and he wanted me to hop a turnstile.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.820]   It was very late at night, the train was here,
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.060]   and I could not physically force myself to do it.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.540]   He was yelling at me, "Come on, do it."
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.220]   I was trying so hard to make my body cross the line,
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.460]   and it was just, it's embedded in my physical being
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:30.940]   to be unable to do stuff like that,
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.620]   which is really annoying.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.980]   - So you're not free to take action in this world?
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.460]   - Yeah, some of them.
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.260]   So that was, I think, the most annoying part
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.980]   of my upbringing.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:46.660]   - Would you classify it as suffering?
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.460]   - At the time, yeah, definitely.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.820]   Well, it's confusing, 'cause when I was a child,
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.220]   it was just painful in the sense that things suck,
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.660]   but it was placed in a meaning framework.
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.180]   It is good, it is virtuous to submit to your parents
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.020]   and do what they want.
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.820]   If they tell you to say goodbye to your best friend forever
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:02.660]   and never talk to them again,
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.180]   you go do that without complaining.
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.460]   And so I would go do something like that,
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.860]   and it would suck.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.180]   It really was concretely painful,
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.820]   but it was also placed in this narrative
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.100]   where I was fulfilling some sort of greater purpose.
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.620]   And so it's very confusing to refer to it as suffering,
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.500]   because there's so many painful things we do today
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.740]   that are placed in the narrative of a greater purpose
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.020]   that I think I would agree with.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.620]   I go get a medical procedure done, and that sucks,
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.140]   but I'm like, "Ah, this is helping me in the long run."
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.060]   But say if I got abducted to an alien planet,
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:32.900]   and they're like, "By the way,
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.180]   "we're gonna have to do all of those medical procedures
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.460]   "you got done.
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.620]   "You didn't have to get them done.
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.740]   "Those are totally unnecessary."
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.140]   Then I might get really upset about it.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:40.820]   - Yeah, I would trust those aliens, though,
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.700]   'cause they probably wanna do
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.540]   different medical procedures than I do.
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:43.380]   - This is true.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:49.180]   - I saw a thumbnail for a video
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.780]   that I'm proud of myself for not clicking on
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.620]   about a man who's claimed that he had sex with aliens.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.380]   And I was like--
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.220]   - Proud of yourself for not clicking on that?
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.040]   - 'Cause I was wondering,
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.900]   'cause I would probably watch it for like 20 minutes,
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.340]   and then I should be doing work.
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.180]   - Oh, I see.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:10.140]   - And I'm actually happy, 'cause I get to imagine
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.820]   all the different possibilities
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.060]   that it could have been for that man who had sex with aliens.
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.980]   - Did you just have a really high resting happiness state?
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:18.820]   - Yes, yeah.
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.140]   It's probably like a mushroom state, yeah.
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.080]   - Wow, do you do mushrooms?
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.380]   - I've done mushrooms before.
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:28.220]   It was very awesome, but more intensely awesome.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.100]   Because just looking at nature,
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.020]   it makes nature even more beautiful, I think.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.060]   But it's already pretty beautiful.
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.500]   I haven't done MDMA.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:43.140]   People say that I should.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.220]   - It's very nice, yeah.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.820]   - Yeah, anyway.
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.500]   But I'm already, yeah.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.500]   What did you call it?
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.140]   Resting happiness state?
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.780]   - Yeah, high resting happiness.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.660]   - Yeah, that's a good way to describe it.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.300]   But it's not like, some of it is genetic,
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.300]   that you're able to notice the beauty in the world,
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.420]   and some of it is practiced,
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:05.220]   where you realize focusing on the negative things in life,
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.740]   like unproductively,
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.820]   it just doesn't help your mind flourish.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.060]   So you just notice that.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:19.500]   I mean, I think people with depression learn that,
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.020]   or probably with trauma, too,
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.700]   is there's certain triggers.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.260]   Like if you suffer from depression,
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.500]   you have to kind of consciously know
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.260]   there's going to be triggers that will force you
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.500]   to spiral down.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.700]   And so just avoid those triggers.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.340]   Some people have that with diet, with food and so on.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.380]   And so I just don't,
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:40.220]   whenever there's shady things happening or shady people,
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.260]   unless I can help, unless I can somehow help,
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.580]   like why focus on it?
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.460]   Yeah.
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:51.460]   Anyway, back to your upbringing.
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:55.220]   What was the journey of escaping that?
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.940]   - I, well, I left home kind of early
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.820]   because my dad and I were not getting along
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.740]   by the time I was a teenager,
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.260]   but I was still Christian for a while.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.220]   And I lost my faith after I think I moved away
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.460]   and I started having friends that weren't religious
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.820]   or weren't raised in this super conservative environment
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.060]   that I came from.
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.860]   And I think, this was not conscious at the time,
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.340]   this is my hindsight story,
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:22.340]   but I believe that being exposed to a culture
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.340]   in which I had the capacity to believe
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.500]   allowed my brain to actually seriously consider
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.660]   the thought that maybe all of this stuff was untrue,
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.500]   that I'd been taught like 6,000 year old earth
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.940]   and evolution is a lie, macroevolution and all of this stuff.
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:40.060]   Because when you're immersed in an environment like that,
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.140]   I don't think you actually have a choice.
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.220]   Like your brain has to believe these things
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.780]   'cause this is a survival thing.
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.300]   Like if you believe this, you'll be,
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.340]   like if you believe the wrong thing,
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.900]   you'll be totally cast out.
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.060]   Even if they're not gonna cast you out,
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.580]   you're gonna be cast out in like communion with others
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.420]   because we were always told
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.020]   that you can't like trust non-believers really.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.740]   They don't have a moral compass.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.140]   They're gonna screw you over.
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.540]   And so I'm like, "Oh, I can't be that.
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.020]   "Like everybody's gonna outcast me internally."
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.820]   So anyway, I don't think I actually had the capacity
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.180]   to seriously question my faith,
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.460]   even though I thought that I was questioning it quite hard
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.380]   until I got into an environment where it was safe to do so.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.060]   And once I started being able to make friends
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:15.980]   who were not religious, I'm like,
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.740]   "Oh, if I lose my faith,
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.500]   "I'm still gonna have some sort of community."
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.700]   And then at that time I went through some questioning
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.140]   and then I lost my faith.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.860]   - So in that, given your friends, given your situation,
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.180]   you now have the freedom to think essentially.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.380]   - Or at least the ability to think
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.100]   is something that was acceptable in the new culture, yeah.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:39.580]   - Without, I mean, is there a danger
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.420]   of like adopting the beliefs of the new culture?
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.060]   So like there's some aspect of just being able
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.660]   to think freely, which you weren't able to do
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.340]   when you were growing up, just to think.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.020]   Like look at the world and wonder how it works,
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.660]   that kind of thing.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.620]   - I mean, you work it within certain boundaries.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.900]   Like there's certain basic assumptions.
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.340]   And as long as you were following those basic assumptions,
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.500]   which is to be fair, it's like kind of what we're doing now.
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.500]   Like we have, have I gone and done the personal research
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.260]   that like evolution is the thing that's going on?
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.660]   Have I looked at like the age of the stones?
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.340]   No, I haven't, I'm trusting other people.
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.180]   - Yeah.
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:15.100]   - Which I think is like a fair choice to make
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.780]   given where I'm at right now.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.700]   - But you're also assuming like
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.460]   there's causality in the universe, time is real.
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.300]   - Yeah.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.340]   - That like, that first of all,
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.000]   the thing that your senses are perceiving is real.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.620]   You're assuming a lot of things.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.700]   - Yeah, I think like it's better just to become aware
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.900]   of the assumptions you're making,
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.140]   like as opposed to not making those assumptions at all.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.780]   Like you have to assume something.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.580]   And I did, it's very suspicious, right?
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.620]   That I went out of this very conservative culture
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.660]   and now, well, I guess I don't believe things
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.420]   that are super in line with the current culture.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.980]   I think this is why I feel a little bit safer right now
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.140]   because like when I was Christian,
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.860]   I believed generally Christian things.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.020]   But now I believe a bunch of things
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.260]   that like people really hate.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.860]   Like I get canceled online all the time.
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.000]   I'm like, okay, this is a sign
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.500]   that maybe you're thinking independently
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.940]   if you're like able to think things
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.660]   that are completely at odds with the people around you.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.340]   And to be fair, this is a little bit easier to do
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.980]   when it's like general culture,
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.660]   but it's much harder to do with your peer group.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.180]   Like the people that you trust, your friends,
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.860]   the people whose opinions you respect,
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:13.180]   like disagreeing with those people is very difficult
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.780]   and I'm not very good at it.
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:18.700]   - Yeah, I do think that if you establish yourself
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.740]   as a person who can be trusted and is a good human being,
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.340]   you have a lot more freedom to then explore ideas
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.820]   that are different from your peer group.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:31.340]   So like those seem, if you separate the space of ideas
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.820]   versus some kind of like deeper sense
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.160]   of what this person is,
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:39.060]   like that they're an interesting and trustworthy
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.580]   and good human being.
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.620]   - Well, like is there somebody that you respect,
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.780]   who you consider significantly smarter than you?
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:49.340]   And can you imagine believing an idea
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.300]   that you've heard them talk really disdainfully about?
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.740]   Like how would you feel coming to me?
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.460]   Like I believe this thing that you find to be.
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.580]   - Yeah, I do all the time.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:58.940]   - Oh yeah? - Yeah.
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.140]   - You may be braver than me.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.780]   (both laughing)
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.420]   And to be fair, I support doing this.
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.420]   Like I try to do this, but I think like subconsciously,
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.060]   I noticed that I don't do it as much.
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.380]   And so I'm suspicious of myself.
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:12.980]   I'm like, oh, I wonder if I'm hiding to myself
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.780]   like actual curiosity about things
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.220]   that might deviate from my peer group.
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.540]   Because I noticed that I'm not actually deviating with them
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.060]   as much as I do with the outside world.
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:20.900]   - That's interesting.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.860]   I mean, like, 'cause I do see most people I interact with
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:23.860]   as smarter than me,
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.700]   but I also have this intuitive feeling that dumb people,
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.160]   which I consider myself being, have wisdom.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.320]   So like in the disagreement,
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.700]   actually I'm also believe in the power of conversation
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.720]   and in the tension of disagreement.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.700]   So I think even just disagreeing from a place,
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.940]   from a good place,
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:47.520]   from a place of like love and respect for each other,
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.500]   I think I just believe in that.
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.120]   So it's not like individuals you're disagreeing,
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.640]   you're like working towards arriving
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.500]   at some deeper truth together, right?
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.980]   Even if the other person is smarter.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.580]   Maybe that's how I justify it for myself.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.220]   I just, I'm also a fan of conversations
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.120]   'cause like I've seen just listening to conversations,
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.340]   it seems like a great conversation
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:15.340]   more emerges from it than the sum of its parts, right?
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.540]   Like somehow two people together can do,
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:22.140]   like that dance of ideas can somehow create a cool thing.
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.100]   By the way, I enjoyed,
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.380]   I saw a video of you dancing at a bar drunk.
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:29.900]   It wasn't the bar drunk, it didn't look drunk,
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.500]   but just the dancing.
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.260]   It was like ballroom dancing type of thing.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.180]   I was like, yeah.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.340]   - Something like that.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.700]   - I've been doing a bit of tango dancing.
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:38.540]   I like it.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.020]   - Argentina?
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:40.860]   - Nice.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.740]   - I like stuff with the body in general,
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.860]   like wrestling or combat.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.580]   Usually when there's a tension,
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:47.900]   you have to understand the mechanics
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:51.060]   of how two bodies move when they're in conflict
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.940]   and dancing is similar.
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:58.260]   - You have to do rapid thinking also,
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.100]   like rapid intuitive physical thinking.
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.700]   And that's my favorite kind of thing.
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.340]   Like a lot of exercise is really boring to me
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.900]   because you can just do it while your brain's off.
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.780]   But something like ballroom dancing or fusion dancing,
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.900]   you have to constantly be figuring out,
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.100]   like it's a rapid puzzle and that's so wonderful.
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:13.940]   - What's fusion dancing?
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.260]   - That's the video.
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.100]   Fusion dancing is like,
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.460]   if you have any sort of dance background,
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.620]   you can come and you just kind of mix those together.
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.140]   So you can have people doing ballet
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.540]   with people doing ballroom with people doing blues.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.380]   - Cool.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.420]   And then there's an interesting dynamic
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.220]   'cause there's, I don't know, maybe you can correct me,
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.460]   but there's, that's very meta,
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.060]   there's usually a lead and a follow.
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.540]   I guess most dances have that.
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.380]   - Yeah.
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:36.380]   - Yeah.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.460]   But both have a different,
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.180]   like you both have to be quite sensitive
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:42.500]   to the other human being, but in a different way.
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.300]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.380]   - Yeah.
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:49.160]   - So I like both that there is that definitive role,
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:54.260]   but also like it's not somehow
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.500]   that one is better than the other.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.980]   There's an interesting tension between the two.
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:58.820]   - Yeah.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:00.700]   It's cool 'cause it's like a basic rule set
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:02.740]   that allows for a ton of expression.
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.300]   I've recently started to experiment with reverse leading.
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.820]   It's not like back leading, it's like, I don't know.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.260]   Like sometimes I'll like lead a move.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.780]   - So you can lead as a follow.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.100]   Oh, you can lead.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:15.300]   - What I'm typically following,
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.100]   I'll like occasionally throw in a little lead
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.340]   here and there.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.740]   - But don't you kind of follow it?
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.580]   Oh, I see.
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:26.100]   Don't you hint at a lead when you're following?
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.940]   Don't you, just by the dynamics of your movement,
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.700]   you're not perfectly following.
[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.500]   I mean, 'cause there is like,
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.100]   the lead is listening to your body, right?
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:36.940]   - Yeah.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:40.420]   - So like you're kind of both figuring out
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.260]   what you do next.
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.100]   - That's true.
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.340]   I'm a very good follow though.
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:44.180]   - Okay.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.180]   - So I'm like an invisible follow.
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.700]   You do move, it's like a.
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:48.540]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:49.380]   - I'm not like good at technique.
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.300]   - I didn't know those existed, like a perfect follow.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.140]   - Oh yeah, perfect.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:52.980]   - So you can perfect follow.
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.100]   - I really, I do.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:56.100]   I'm not great at technique and sometimes I'll fall over,
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.300]   but like with the following part, I'm very good at it.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.140]   - Do you enjoy following?
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.980]   - Yeah, yeah, it's really nice.
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.140]   It's again, like it's a very fast physical puzzle
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:03.980]   you have to solve.
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:04.820]   It's like typing.
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:05.660]   I really like typing.
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.820]   I was inquiring about your keyboard earlier.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.140]   - Why do you like typing?
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:12.340]   - It's like the very fast, like the really rapid response.
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.620]   What's the, reaction time.
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.100]   I like things that like have very fast reaction times,
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:17.140]   like games like that.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.660]   - But typing is not a reaction
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.300]   or is it the brain generating words
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.980]   and then you're like, how's typing a reaction?
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.340]   - Okay, the sensation that I get when I am typing
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:26.860]   is the kind of thing that I'm trying to point out.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:28.740]   So maybe reaction time isn't the quite,
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.020]   I don't know what the term is, but whatever that thing is.
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.660]   Like the thing where you have to like look at a word
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.700]   and then communicate it into your fingers.
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.140]   - Yeah.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.620]   - It feels like dancing.
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:38.580]   - Like you're responding.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.620]   You're responding to your brain.
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:41.380]   Your fingers are doing the responding to the brain
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:43.260]   that generated the words.
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.500]   - Making your body do what your brain wants it to do,
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:47.180]   but like fast and precisely.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.180]   - Well, then you might not like this Kinesis keyboard
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.780]   'cause it makes it easier to do that.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.260]   You probably like the struggle, right?
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.620]   - Well, I mean, it looks hard because you have,
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:59.100]   it looks like it's high depression on the keys.
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:00.700]   - No, well, oh, I see.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.660]   Yes, more than like a laptop keyboard,
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:06.100]   but like that you don't have to,
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.780]   one of the main things is you don't have to move
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.220]   your fingers at all.
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:13.180]   So like, for example, a lot of people,
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.100]   I think they have a backspace up in the top right corner.
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.460]   So if you have to make mistakes, which is like,
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:22.940]   I mean, that's like so metaphorical.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.140]   Every mistake you have to like really hurt yourself for
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.740]   'cause you have to like stretch for the backspace.
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.380]   - So there's that poetic narrative again.
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:31.220]   - It's everywhere.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.540]   - It like emanates in like a lot of your perspective.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.380]   - Everything, yeah, no.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:40.580]   Yeah, I don't, and I see it as a good thing.
[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:44.620]   It's a good, like a romantic element
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:47.060]   permeates my interpretation of the world, yes.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:49.640]   But you left home early.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:54.260]   How did you end up working at a factory?
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.060]   - I tried to go to college, but failed.
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.780]   Couldn't afford it.
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:58.660]   - Did you like it?
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:01.980]   - I remember it just being really slow.
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.780]   I remember being shocked that the teachers didn't care.
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.220]   Like I was used to homeschooling.
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:08.060]   - Yeah.
[00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.340]   - And where, I don't know, like educate,
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:11.340]   it just like, it meant something.
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:13.140]   It felt like the people around me that were teaching me,
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.300]   'cause we had like a mom's group also,
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.100]   like directly cared about what I was learning.
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.180]   And I would be able to ask questions
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.020]   and they would like really respond.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.140]   - What's a mom's group?
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:21.660]   - And it was like a homeschooling group.
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.900]   So we're a bunch of moms who are homeschooling their kids,
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:27.180]   get together and then teach each other's kids.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:28.620]   - Oh, cool. - Yeah.
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:30.540]   - And they have different like interests and capabilities
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.740]   and so on and they kinda-
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.380]   And sometimes if some of the kids are really good
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:35.100]   at something, you have like the older kids teaching
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:36.380]   the other ones too.
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:38.220]   So it was very like, everybody kind of figures out
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:40.300]   what they're good at and they share that skill set
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.300]   with everybody else.
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.460]   Which I think was a pretty great setup.
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:44.660]   Honestly, I think my childhood kinda sucked
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:48.100]   in a lot of ways, but homeschooling was excellent for me.
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:49.940]   Mainly because it just had so much free time.
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:52.460]   Like I just did like two to three hours of school
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:53.700]   and then did whatever the fuck I wanted
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:54.700]   for the rest of the day.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.180]   And I got to actually pursue skills
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.420]   that are still useful for me to this day, so.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.580]   - Even in that constrained environment.
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:03.460]   - Like I wrote, I've read fantasy books
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:04.540]   and I wrote so much.
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.380]   And now I'm writing a lot for my blog, so.
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:08.340]   - What kind of fantasy books?
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.540]   Like sci-fi type stuff?
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:13.900]   - Like classic, like I read like "Mercedes Lackey"
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:18.900]   and "The E.E. Knight" and "ArcelorLeguin" and-
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:19.900]   - I don't know any of this.
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:20.740]   What is this?
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:21.580]   What is it?
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:22.400]   Is it like a romantic thing?
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.340]   Or is it like, is it romance?
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.500]   - All the fantasy books.
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.540]   Like "Dragons" and "Elves." - Oh, "Dragons."
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.780]   Got it, got it, got it, got it.
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.780]   You didn't mention "Tolkien" for the fantasy.
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:30.980]   - I read "Tolkien." - Okay.
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:31.820]   - Yeah.
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:32.700]   - All right, well, it's beautiful.
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.180]   So you threw all the dragons.
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.660]   How did you end up in a factory?
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:38.500]   You tried school.
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:39.380]   - Yeah, yeah, I tried school.
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.580]   Had to drop out for a couple of months.
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.020]   And then I was like, well, I'm poor.
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:44.980]   And I was ready to take any job.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.220]   I was like applying for sewer jobs.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:47.780]   And then I got a factory.
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:48.620]   I'm like, all right, let's do it.
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.740]   'Cause my parents, no financial help at all.
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.580]   They're like, you pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.
[00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.220]   So anyway, I went to work at a factory
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.500]   and that sucked ass.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.340]   Do not recommend.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:00.660]   We had to wake up like 4 a.m.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.220]   Work on weekends too.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.180]   Fluorescent lights.
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.000]   It was terrible.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.380]   And so I did that for about a year.
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.500]   And I was like, this is,
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.700]   I was trying to grip my teeth and be like,
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:09.980]   this is my life, right?
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.740]   I didn't have high expectations for my life.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:12.580]   I was just like,
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.180]   I thought like if you get a job
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:15.540]   where you don't have to be on your feet all the time,
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:17.820]   that's, you're living a good life.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:21.340]   But, and then I got another job briefly as a photographer.
[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:22.180]   And then they fired me.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:24.260]   I think I was 19 at the time.
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:25.620]   - Fired you for like-
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:27.660]   - I was just too young.
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:31.220]   And really, really bad at interacting with people
[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:32.380]   in the outside world.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:34.180]   Like I was pretty well socialized as a homeschooler
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.020]   with other homeschoolers,
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:36.140]   but in the outside world,
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.900]   especially with all of the like hierarchy submission stuff
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.500]   beaten into me, like literally beaten into me,
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.740]   it was very difficult for me to interact with other people
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:44.940]   who were like older than me
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.020]   or had any sort of confidence at all.
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:49.100]   So they hired me to do like photography for people.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.420]   And then I was rapidly,
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:52.740]   turned out that I was bad at this.
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.860]   And so they fired me.
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.460]   But at that point I'd left my factory job.
[00:53:55.460 --> 00:53:57.260]   I'm like, I can't go back to the factory.
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:58.860]   So I tried, I had some savings
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.380]   and I slept on friends' couches
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.180]   and I tried various self-employment stuff.
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:06.420]   I'm like, maybe I can do product photography or something,
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.500]   but it's Idaho, you know, nothing.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.500]   And if you're like a 19 year old
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.820]   with no experience in the outside world at all,
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.140]   it was really difficult.
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.060]   And so I had a friend recommend
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:18.020]   that I try becoming a cam girl.
[00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:19.380]   So that's how it started.
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:22.020]   - What's, what is camming?
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.260]   What is being a cam girl?
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.100]   What's that called?
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.780]   - Camming is like you talk to the camera live
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:27.940]   on the computer, like you live stream.
[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:28.980]   It's kind of like Twitch.
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:30.180]   And then people are typing in the chat,
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:31.180]   like, "Hi, do this stuff."
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.980]   And then the people can tip you money
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:34.340]   and then you can do things in response.
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.820]   Like, "Oh, if you tip me a hundred tokens,
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.100]   you know, I'll take my shirt off," or something like that.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.580]   - And like, what's the,
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.060]   what site were you using at that time?
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.340]   - MyFreeCams.
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.180]   - MyFreeCams?
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:44.580]   Is that a popular site?
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.420]   - Yeah, it's pretty popular.
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:46.540]   - Okay.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:49.380]   And how did, what were the next steps?
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:51.380]   Like, did you enjoy it?
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:52.540]   - Oh, well, it was the first time
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:54.340]   I had actual control over my life.
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:56.940]   And I made like actual real money.
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.100]   And so I just exploded into it.
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.980]   I thought about it nonstop.
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:02.140]   I was streaming all the time.
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:04.100]   I was like coming up with like new creative things.
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.700]   And the thing is like, I don't know.
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:08.980]   There's something about public school that I ended up living
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.300]   in a house of cam girls full of other girls
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:11.140]   who had gone to public school.
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:12.900]   And I don't know if how much of it's genetic
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:13.940]   or like just because I'm weird
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:15.420]   or is it because of our upbringing?
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.300]   But I felt like I was much more fearless
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.820]   and much more weird and creative online
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:21.660]   than other people were.
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:23.540]   Not because they weren't awesome people,
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:24.860]   but because I think like public school,
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:26.580]   I got the impression based on them talking about it
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:28.620]   that it sort of like beats out any sort of deviance
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.460]   from you.
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:33.580]   - More so than your, 'cause I got the-
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.380]   - Oh, we had moral deviance was beaten out,
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:36.780]   but like you could do whatever.
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:37.620]   - Creative deviance was not.
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:39.180]   - Creative deviance wasn't so much.
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:42.660]   Like I didn't have other kids making fun of me ever.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.300]   I don't think I'd ever heard an insult
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:47.500]   about my physical appearance as a child or teenager once.
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.100]   - So your father was basically saying
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:50.740]   you're not good enough was intellectual.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:52.580]   - Oh, no, that was like moral failure.
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:53.780]   - Moral failure.
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.820]   - Yeah, like I was not virtuous.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:57.140]   - Oh, wow.
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:59.140]   - Like in various ways, like you're lazy
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.660]   and mostly the lazy part.
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:04.900]   I have like ADHD or something.
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:05.740]   - Yeah.
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:07.180]   - And I was not good at it as a kid either.
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.980]   I would totally forget all the time.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:12.780]   - Is there some sexual repression aspect to that?
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:15.380]   Like, you know how they say that there's,
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:16.780]   it's not just homeschooling,
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:18.740]   but just like Catholic girls and so on,
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:20.020]   just because like there's moral,
[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:22.340]   you're forbidden to do certain things.
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:25.420]   Like there's a kind of liberating feeling of saying,
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:27.860]   like basically rediscovering yourself,
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.980]   rediscovering your freedom by doing,
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:35.500]   just diving head in, head first into sexuality,
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:36.740]   into your own sexuality.
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:37.740]   Is there some aspect to that?
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.380]   - Yeah, absolutely to some degree.
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.780]   I think that like people kind of model it slightly wrong.
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.400]   Like I think there's a truth to it.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.140]   But when I first got out of the house,
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:48.260]   for me, freedom was like going outside at 2 a.m.
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:50.460]   or like eating chocolate, you know,
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.900]   on days that I previously wasn't allowed to eat chocolate.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:55.420]   Like that was like a really intense expression
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:56.580]   of rebellion for me.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.580]   And I think people like don't think of this,
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:01.380]   like I got out a lot of my like intense rebellion
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:02.860]   through things that people don't typically consider
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.180]   to be rebellious at all.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:05.580]   Like I wore a bikini.
[00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:06.540]   - Yeah.
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:07.980]   - Insane.
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:10.580]   - And just like walked around in it and like,
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:11.420]   I can do this.
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.100]   - Yeah, basically.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:15.700]   And so like, this was most of that emotional processing
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:16.540]   for me.
[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:19.420]   And it took me a couple of years from leaving home
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.980]   and all of that conservative culture into doing sex work.
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:25.500]   In the meantime, I did try having sex with a lot of people,
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.420]   but this was mainly because I didn't know
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.640]   what the norms were.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.100]   I didn't really understand.
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:31.580]   I was just like, okay, take things logically,
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.260]   take things one step at a time.
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:35.720]   And I'm like, okay, if the whole previous set
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.520]   about like how I'm not supposed to kiss somebody
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.040]   until the altar of marriage,
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.120]   if that's not the way that things are supposed to go,
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:43.180]   then what is the way things are supposed to go?
[00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:44.700]   And I was like, well, if I am aroused,
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.140]   I should go have sex with someone, right?
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.020]   Is there any reason not to?
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:47.860]   No.
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:51.380]   I would go around asking random people to have sex with me.
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:53.100]   - Did you have any peer pressure saying like,
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.740]   that's not good or that is good?
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:57.140]   Or like any, did you feel any currents of society
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.340]   in any direction?
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:01.700]   Or are you independently just thinking like
[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:03.260]   from first principles?
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.100]   - I think, I mean, like I'm not saying
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:06.380]   it was a totally clean thing.
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:08.060]   I'm sure that I was experiencing society
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:09.660]   telling me this is bad, but you have to know,
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.300]   like I wasn't watching normal movies when I was a teen.
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.540]   Like we watched Christian movies,
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.680]   or the stuff that we watched was filtered.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.300]   Like I watched the Titanic and I had no idea
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:18.620]   that Jack and Rose had sex,
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:20.700]   because it was put through a filtered-
[00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:21.580]   - Wait, did they?
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:23.820]   - Yeah, they went and, you know, he painted her naked.
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:27.340]   And there was a scene in a car on the ship.
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.260]   - In a car, on the ship?
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.420]   - Yeah, on the, they had like stored cars in storage
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:31.300]   and there's a hand.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.620]   I watched it again later.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:33.460]   And I was like, oh my God.
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:34.540]   - I don't remember the sex scene.
[00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:38.540]   - Well, maybe were you also put through a filtered version?
[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:40.860]   - No, maybe it's the filter I see,
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.340]   like did the couple in the notebook also have sex?
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.900]   'Cause maybe for romantic movies,
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:49.140]   I focus on the romance, maybe, right?
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.300]   And the sex scenes are always like weirdly filmed
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:55.140]   in these, 'cause it's never, I mean,
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:58.380]   it doesn't, it feels more like romance than sex.
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.580]   I guess that's the main focus of this, right?
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:01.940]   - Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:03.220]   - Yeah, anyway.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.420]   So they had sex, it's good to know now.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:05.260]   - They did, I'm letting you know.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:06.660]   - I'll go back and watch now to fact check.
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:09.060]   - You have your own personal filter on your brain.
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.620]   - And once you realize that there are some,
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.700]   like the foundation of your beliefs were wrong,
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.020]   then everything might be wrong
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.060]   and you're kind of just doing
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:17.900]   from first principles. - Yeah, it's like
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:19.220]   from first principles, basically.
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:21.420]   And again, like not totally separate from culture,
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:22.860]   but also I think in general,
[00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:24.900]   I also have a predisposition to just be like,
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:26.300]   you know, fuck what culture tells you,
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:28.660]   just figure out what's right for you and do it.
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:30.060]   And so that mixed with, you know,
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:31.780]   the figuring things out from first principles.
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.980]   I did eventually figure out that I didn't like
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:37.180]   having casual sex with just anybody quite as much.
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:39.100]   So I stopped that, but it took me a while to figure that out.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:40.700]   - What's the negative of casual sex?
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:42.380]   - It's just like not good.
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:44.780]   I mean, if you like figure out the chemistry
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:45.820]   you have with someone better,
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:48.260]   then it can be a lot nicer, but I wasn't doing that.
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.740]   I was just like somebody I met and I'm like,
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:53.540]   you seem kind of cute, okay.
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:56.060]   Like I didn't bother to try and develop any chemistry.
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:56.900]   I mean, I didn't know.
[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:57.740]   - Chemistry even outside of sex,
[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:59.180]   just chemistry, like human chemistry,
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.300]   like conversation. - Yeah, just basic.
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.580]   Yeah. - Okay.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.680]   - I would, it's like kind of cringy,
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.220]   but I would like walk up to guys or send them messages.
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:09.020]   Like, would you like to have coitus is what I would say.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:09.860]   - You would say coitus.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:10.940]   - I'd said that.
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.180]   (both laughing)
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.180]   - I mean, it's kind of cute in a way.
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:16.900]   - I mean, it's a girl asking you to get laid,
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.580]   so they probably didn't care that much.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.460]   But anyway, I'm saying that like,
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.260]   I had a lot of rebellion out of my system
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:23.700]   by the time I started sex work.
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.620]   - Yeah.
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.060]   - So like for me, like maybe I'm sure it was somehow related
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.900]   'cause we were extremely sexually repressed growing up.
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.540]   I remember the day I learned I had a vagina,
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.900]   which was absolutely horrifying.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.620]   Do not recommend figuring out
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.540]   you have another orifice in your body.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.180]   But like- - Do you wanna share
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.700]   the process of you figuring out that you had a vagina?
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.380]   - Actually, they told me I had a vagina.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:45.020]   - Oh, like intellectually, like there was somebody said,
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.700]   you have a vagina. - You have a vagina, yeah.
[01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.180]   - And that was horrifying to you.
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:50.740]   - Yeah, I didn't know I had,
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.900]   'cause you weren't supposed to ever like
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.900]   touch or look at yourself ever, so I never did.
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.440]   It was really disgusting.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.180]   And so I had no idea that what was going on
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.220]   in my genital region.
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.540]   And so one day my mom sat me down,
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.540]   I think it was like nine or 10,
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.500]   and she was like, you have a, there's another?
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.340]   - What?
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.820]   - And you're going to bleed out of it,
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.060]   is what she told me.
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.300]   You're gonna bleed out of it for a while.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.360]   And I was like, what the fuck, mom?
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.820]   (both laughing)
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:18.700]   I didn't know what the word fuck was,
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.860]   but I would have said that if I had known.
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.940]   - When did you first learn the word fuck?
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.100]   - Oh, I think I learned it when I was at a playground
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.820]   and it was written somewhere and I read it out loud
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.060]   and then the kid next to me started giggling.
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:34.900]   - Did you ever, did you say fuck again for a while?
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.180]   - No, I think the next time I said,
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.820]   I swore the first time I was 18.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.200]   Like intentionally said a swear word when I was 18.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.160]   - Did it feel good?
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.920]   - I was like really nervous.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.760]   I was like nervous. - What's your favorite
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.580]   swear word?
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.440]   - I mean, fuck's pretty good.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.400]   - Yeah, fuck's pretty good.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.760]   - Yeah.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.320]   - Okay, so that's camming.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.280]   I mean, what are the pros and cons of camming
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.440]   and how does OnlyFans map into this?
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.360]   Did you switch to OnlyFans at some point?
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.520]   - I did, yeah.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.120]   I cammed for like five or six years
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.840]   and I burned out eventually.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:04.840]   - What are the good aspects?
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.400]   What are the bad aspects of camming?
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.080]   - Well, the good aspects were that it was just
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.800]   your own terms, you get to decide.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.620]   Everything about it is under your control,
[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:13.240]   which I loved at the time.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.120]   I was like, I can work when I want, how I want,
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.080]   any sort of expression I experimented.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.080]   And I was very successful.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.320]   I was making around $200 an hour,
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.880]   which for that website at the time was like pretty good.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.080]   I had elaborate routines.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:24.900]   I was a mime.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.320]   I would do like dress up as a mime
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.440]   and then dress up a chair and I would seduce the chair.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.280]   - Oh, cool.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.120]   - Yeah, or like.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.780]   - So it was, was there an artistic element to it almost?
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:36.080]   - Yeah, very much.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.000]   I had like nose. - Did you talk to the chair?
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:38.840]   Did you get gnomes?
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.120]   - No, I was a mime, you know.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.520]   - Oh, sorry, right.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.080]   - Yeah, get it straight, dude.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.200]   (laughing)
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.400]   - You know what I really appreciate about you
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.520]   is I'm asking some really dumb questions
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.200]   and you're answering in a very intelligent way,
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.200]   so I appreciate that.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.040]   (laughing)
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:54.880]   All right, did you ask the chair questions?
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.360]   (laughing)
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.080]   I was a mime, you fucking idiot.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:58.920]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.760]   (laughing)
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.200]   It's true.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.360]   But there's gnomes on the, like big gnomes or small gnomes?
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.480]   - Like lawn gnomes.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.320]   - Lawn gnomes?
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.800]   And you seduce the lawn gnome on the chair,
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.640]   the gnome is sitting on the chair?
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.360]   - There were some, yeah, gnomes on the chair.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.120]   I did a photo set which I submitted to Reddit
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.160]   where I got abducted.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.540]   I was like stripping, taking my clothes off,
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.320]   and then slowly the gnomes surrounded me in the background
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.160]   and dragged me off.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.600]   And I did this as a photo set.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.440]   - Consensually?
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:25.520]   - I mean, I didn't feel consensual in the photos, but.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.480]   - Okay.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:27.320]   - But it was the 11th top post of--
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.600]   - Consensual, not consensual, the gnomes.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.760]   - It was very successful on Reddit, basically.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.800]   It was the top post on Gone Wild,
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.840]   and the 11th top post of all time on Reddit.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.500]   - Which I think probably just means it's like,
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:40.960]   it's artistic, it's interesting, it's edgy, it's funny,
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.200]   so it's really, really well done.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.040]   - But it was really shocking to me
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.160]   that nobody else was doing anything creative with sex work.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.640]   Like for me, it was like breathing.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.040]   Like you're just doing sex and you're bored,
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:48.880]   and I'm like, what do you do?
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.700]   I don't know, let's try something funny.
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.920]   Like it's just the natural progression.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.440]   And it felt to me like there was almost no competition.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.720]   Like I would just be really creative
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.600]   and like immediately it was the top
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.840]   not safe for work post on Reddit.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.360]   I'm like, well, I didn't even try that hard.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.680]   And so it's really shocking to me
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.320]   that other women who are doing this sort of thing.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.620]   - Is that still a little bit of the case?
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.240]   That there's not as much like,
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.340]   'cause from my sort of outsider perspective,
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.500]   that seems to be still the case.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.140]   Like there's not, like as you describe it,
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:17.980]   that's kind of cool.
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:20.560]   That's like almost like playing,
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.420]   like having fun with sexuality almost.
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:23.260]   - Yeah.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.740]   - But that does require kind of thinking through.
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:29.020]   It's almost like a creative project,
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.500]   like a photography project or something like that.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.700]   Almost like a little skit movie.
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:34.540]   It's interesting.
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:35.380]   - It's this vibe of like,
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.700]   how can you like bring like vibrant novelty
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.460]   to whatever you're doing, anything you're doing.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.300]   And I really like doing this with surveys too.
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:42.900]   Like I've been doing a lot of standard surveys,
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.100]   but I'm also like experimenting
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.940]   with novel creative artistic surveys.
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.780]   I'm like, how do you ask a question
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:49.540]   in a way that's like beautiful and unusual
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.260]   and like a thing that's completely groundbreaking?
[01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.380]   Like nobody's ever like-
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.180]   - You always make everything so poetic
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.620]   and romantic is disgusting.
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:05:00.620]   But yes, I think you have that engine in your head,
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:01.900]   I guess, of creativity.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:03.580]   Like, yeah, the way you ask questions,
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:04.820]   it's not trivial to do.
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:08.700]   It's actually very difficult to do,
[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.700]   like good survey questions.
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.700]   And I mean, we're joking, but like, yeah,
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:16.020]   almost like poetic because you have to ask a question
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.060]   in a way that doesn't lead to the answer.
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:18.900]   - Yes.
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:22.300]   - Like you have to kind of inspire them to think
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.020]   and then indirectly get at the truth.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.540]   It's an art form, honestly.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:28.380]   - Yeah, and also in a way
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.780]   where they don't misinterpret the question
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.860]   because it's amazing how any question you think,
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:34.180]   oh, this is the clearest question possible.
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.020]   No, you're wrong.
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.540]   It has to be even clearer.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:38.140]   - Right, willingly or unwillingly.
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:39.900]   'Cause like you also have to defend
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.780]   against that question being criticized later
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.540]   when you publish about it, all of that.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.380]   You have to think about it all.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:45.940]   - Yeah, I think this might be my greatest strength.
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.140]   So I'm not very good at statistics.
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:48.620]   I'm not like great at presenting data,
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:50.020]   but I think probably my greatest strength
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.860]   is in fact survey design and like question phrasing.
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:56.340]   'Cause I have treated so many thousands of polls
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.260]   and every single one I get people telling me
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:00.140]   like the way that they misinterpreted the poll.
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:00.980]   So it's like-
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:01.820]   - You've become a master.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:03.100]   - I'm like a master.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.660]   And then again, I'm testing the phrasings all the time.
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.420]   Like what happens if you slightly shift phrasings?
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.820]   And so I'll do the same question test over time
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.740]   to see how it changes
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.580]   and the way the framing affects the results.
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:16.220]   - So the good and the bad of the camming.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.820]   So you said good, the, what was it?
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.660]   I forgot.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:20.500]   - The freedom.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:21.340]   - The freedom.
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:22.860]   The freedom to also be creative.
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:24.420]   - Yeah.
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:25.860]   And the bad is just that it was exhausting.
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.780]   The site that I was on, the way that it's structured
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:29.060]   is that you're ranking on the site
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:30.660]   and thus the amount of people that see you
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:32.980]   and thus the amount of money you are on, you earn
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.020]   is affected by the amount of money that you earn
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.060]   on average over the last 60 days.
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.940]   So if you're streaming and nobody's tipping you,
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.620]   this means that you're going to be dropping
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:41.460]   down in the rankings,
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:42.740]   which is gonna make it harder in the future.
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.380]   - Okay, so the rich get richer on that site?
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.980]   - Yeah, so it's very high pressure.
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:48.740]   Like if you're on, you need to be making money
[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:52.140]   as fast as you can, if you wanna continue to make money.
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:53.500]   So that was really stressful.
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.200]   It was very mentally taxing.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.220]   I would do it for a couple hours
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.020]   and just log off and be completely exhausted
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.060]   'cause you're just like on as hard as you can.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.780]   And this is why I have a little PTSD around streaming.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:03.940]   Like I've considered Twitch streaming
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:05.820]   and I try a little bit and I'm like,
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.860]   I haven't fully integrated the fact
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:10.500]   that you don't have to be like maximally entertaining
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.820]   every single second yet.
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.820]   You can actually just chill out and take it slow
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:15.100]   and nothing bad happens.
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:17.540]   - Yeah, yeah, you can just enjoy silence.
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.380]   - Yeah.
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:26.440]   - Did you feel lonely doing it?
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.620]   I mean, even just streamers feel lonely.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.420]   - I moved into a house of cam girls.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:33.940]   - Did that make it better or worse?
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:34.980]   - Better, they're great.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.660]   I'm still friends with them to this day.
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:37.700]   - Oh, so it was like a team,
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.740]   almost like we're in this kind of together?
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.540]   - Yeah, so we would like work together
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:46.300]   and stream together and swap our clothes and stuff.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.260]   It was great.
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.300]   - Swap ideas too?
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:49.780]   - Swap ideas, yeah.
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:53.660]   - And actually on a small tangent, maybe a big tangent,
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:55.340]   what do you think, 'cause it's a recent controversy
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:58.980]   of Andrew Tate and that he, I think in the past,
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:00.700]   ran a camming business
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.380]   and he's being accused of sex trafficking.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.780]   What do you think, like from your own experience,
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:08.860]   what do you understand about Andrew Tate?
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:11.060]   Is he a good person, is he a bad person?
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.420]   Is there something shady about his practices or not?
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:14.980]   - I wish I could answer, but I don't know.
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.460]   I haven't looked into it at all.
[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:17.780]   I've heard people talking about it,
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:19.980]   I just haven't bothered to go into it.
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:21.860]   It is well known that, like when I was doing it
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.340]   back in the day, the Eastern European models
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.100]   had something different going on though.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.740]   It was like a trope about,
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:28.100]   you know, there's the Eastern European models
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.660]   and then there's everybody else.
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.900]   - They're what, it's like darker or something like that?
[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:35.620]   - Like they do studios and they're lower quality.
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.380]   - Which means what?
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.980]   - Studios are, you go into like a warehouse
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:42.260]   and then they have set up a little,
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.020]   like things that replicate bedrooms,
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:46.060]   but they're just like stalls.
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.300]   And then you give, you rent out
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:49.860]   or you pay the studio percentage of your income.
[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:51.380]   And you can tell when something looks like a studio,
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:52.940]   it's like a type of background.
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:53.980]   If you're like watching enough,
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:56.540]   it kind of starts to, you notice the patterns.
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.700]   - So like the standards are lower there
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.460]   and the ethical boundaries are a little looser.
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:02.300]   - Yeah.
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.820]   - Of how people are treated.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:06.220]   - I'd never heard anything about the ethical side.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.580]   I just knew that it was like lower quality.
[01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:10.820]   Like the girls seemed like they were less into it
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:13.060]   and like cared less.
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.540]   - How does this all interplay with like sex trafficking?
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.900]   So consensual versus non-consensual.
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:19.020]   - I would be shocked if there were never
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:20.580]   any non-consensual camming.
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:23.780]   I mean, I guess it's like, if it were going to happen,
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:25.420]   I wouldn't be surprised if it were in fact
[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:26.620]   Eastern European models.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:27.700]   Based on, this is outdated.
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.220]   This is, I'm just thinking of my stereotypes
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.380]   back when I cammed a lot.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.740]   - Sure, so some of that is stereotypes
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:33.540]   versus like collecting good data, right?
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:36.060]   - Yeah, I haven't done data on cam girl.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.580]   - It's hard, I mean, it's hard.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.940]   It's even hard to get that data, right?
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.860]   But obviously a really important problem.
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.780]   - There's a method that I'm trying that I really like.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:45.980]   I designed a survey type,
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.700]   which is like asking people who you know.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.540]   - Yeah.
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:49.780]   - Like, who do you know who's done this?
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:50.980]   And you tell me like, oh, do you know anybody
[01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:51.820]   who's a doctor?
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:54.900]   Do you know anybody who has had cancer or like smokes?
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:55.780]   - Personally, you mean?
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.380]   - Yeah, personally, just do you know anybody?
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:58.220]   - Yeah.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:59.860]   - And then if you ask about a whole bunch of things,
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.700]   you can calibrate the responses.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.220]   So like, if your population, you know,
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.380]   20% of them know doctors,
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.260]   and then you know the actual amount of doctors,
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.260]   then you can tell like how this is corresponding.
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:11.620]   Like what is the visibility of doctors?
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.220]   - So you can reconstruct the graph.
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:14.180]   - Basically, yeah.
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:15.580]   And we can do this with sex trafficking.
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:16.500]   Of course, people are going to be like,
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.660]   well, sex trafficking is not visible.
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:18.940]   People, you don't know those.
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:21.100]   Like, well, then we can ask about other non-visible things
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.620]   that other people don't know that we do have data for.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.180]   Like homelessness or being in jail,
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:27.540]   or like if you have been like sexually assaulted,
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.860]   a lot of people don't like talking about
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.140]   if they've been sexually assaulted.
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:31.580]   So you can do a whole bunch of things
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:34.580]   that are like similarly suppressed in knowledge in some way
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.460]   that we do actually have rates for,
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:38.780]   and then compare that to the graph when we ask people,
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:40.580]   do you know anybody who's in sex traffic?
[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:41.420]   - Yeah.
[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:42.340]   - So again, this is not perfect.
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.180]   I'm not saying this is ideal.
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:45.500]   - But you can infer things.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:48.020]   You can infer things about that graph.
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:49.500]   - But I'm saying we don't have good ways
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.020]   of measuring sex trafficking right now.
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.860]   Anyway, I did a big deep dive into the research
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.900]   that we have on sex trafficking in the Western world,
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:57.260]   and the actual, like I read the studies
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:59.100]   and like reports about the studies,
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.340]   and it's really pitiful.
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.860]   We have terrible data.
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:04.300]   It's like, there's just like vague estimations
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.780]   made from one guy in a basement in the '80s.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.780]   That's like the basis for like one big study
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.620]   that like a lot of people report on.
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:14.020]   And so I'm like, okay, so the method I'm proposing,
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.400]   obviously it's not perfect,
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.860]   but like the bar is so low at this point.
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:21.420]   - Well, I wonder also if there's ways to design a survey
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:26.300]   that gets at the victims of sex trafficking also,
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:30.380]   which is they presumably have public access to the internet.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:35.720]   And I wonder how many of them are distinctly aware
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.860]   that they're victims.
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:39.660]   Like it's asking the question,
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:41.520]   when you're inside of a toxic relationship,
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.940]   are you inside of a toxic relationship?
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:46.740]   I mean, if the toxic relationship is truly toxic,
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.580]   sometimes your mind is fucked with, right?
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:52.700]   You don't even know what's true.
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.700]   So it's interesting if you can design surveys-
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:56.060]   - For people who are actively sex trafficked?
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.340]   - Yeah, who could break through that.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:01.260]   So basically get data on how many people
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.620]   are getting sex trafficked directly.
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.980]   - Oh yeah, like if you don't frame it,
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.580]   like if you don't say the word sex trafficking,
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:09.020]   you're like, are you just in a situation where you'd-
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.380]   - And maybe through the survey, I mean, that's very meta,
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.420]   but through the survey, help them.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.140]   - You know, this is what started my relationship surveys.
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.740]   So I've done a series of relationship surveys,
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:18.900]   and that was because I knew somebody
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:19.900]   in a terrible relationship.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.140]   And I was like, I bet if she took a survey
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:23.540]   where she answered questions about her relationship
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.620]   and at the end got a score
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.300]   that compared her to everybody else,
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.220]   she'd be like, oh wait, everybody else
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:29.880]   has much better relationships than I do.
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.100]   So that's why I started making the relationship surveys,
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:33.300]   was exactly for that reason.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:34.840]   - Yeah, that's really, really, really powerful
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:38.700]   to know that you're not crazy
[01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.740]   for thinking this is a bad relationship.
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:43.260]   - Right, or I think the actual question is like,
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.540]   could you do better if you broke up?
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.260]   I think that the thing that keeps most people
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:48.100]   in their relationships is like,
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.780]   this is the best that I can do.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:50.660]   Like, this is normal.
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.020]   And if it were normal, I would say that they are right.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:53.940]   Like, if you live in a culture
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:56.740]   where everybody is abusing their people
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.260]   in their relationships, then yeah,
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.620]   I mean, what are you gonna do?
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.860]   Break up and then just be alone for the rest of your life?
[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.660]   Most people don't wanna do that.
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:08.140]   - But now comparing yourself to the average is good to know.
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.220]   - Know what your options are.
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:11.500]   - At least understand it, because being normal
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:15.040]   is not always, like this conversation is not always great.
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:19.860]   Meaning this conversation is anything but normal.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:24.860]   Okay, and that was a tangent on a tangent
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:28.260]   about a niche passion, which is really fascinating
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:29.700]   that you're playing with those kinds of ideas
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.580]   of survey design.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:34.700]   But back to camming, so what were the cons?
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:36.100]   What were the negatives of camming?
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:38.260]   - Oh, like the exhaustion of just like live,
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:39.580]   like the high pressure thing.
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:41.420]   That was probably the worst thing.
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:44.340]   - So not, what about the interaction with different people?
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:45.940]   Like the dynamics of the interaction
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:48.060]   with the fans, I guess.
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:49.700]   - I had a pretty great time.
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.180]   I mean, it obviously wasn't perfect
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.220]   'cause it's the internet, but I don't know.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:55.620]   This is the thing that confuses me a lot,
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.500]   because a lot of women that I know complain
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.060]   about being harassed by men quite a lot.
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.300]   They're like, you know, men are always,
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.260]   you know, grow up in a harass,
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:03.260]   you have to be paranoid in the club.
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:05.260]   People are like, they're always huffing on you
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.620]   and you're just like, Jesus Christ, get away, man.
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.220]   And I do not have this experience.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.140]   Or like, maybe I do,
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:10.820]   but I'm interpreting it differently, I don't know.
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.340]   The thing is, I don't know what causes me
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.540]   to have such a different experience from these women
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:17.980]   that are like really, feel really hostile towards men.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.860]   And my guess is that there's some sort
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:22.500]   of like very subtle signaling that we're accidentally doing.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.420]   Be like, no fault of our own.
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:24.260]   I'm not saying this is a virtue.
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:26.260]   I'm saying like, maybe it's just genetic
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:28.220]   or the fact that I'm-- - That women are doing?
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:29.620]   - That the women are doing, yeah.
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:31.420]   Like that, and it might be just something
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:34.020]   I'm completely accidentally, through no intention,
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.700]   like happening to signal the thing
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.220]   that is causing men to not view me
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:40.780]   as like a desirable target, or like a target at all.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.940]   - Well, what about the flip side?
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:46.700]   Maybe you're not sensitive to the creepy stare.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.140]   - Yeah, that also might be true.
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:52.140]   - The dude who's like, as I'm dressing you with his eyes,
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:54.940]   that like in a creepy way,
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:57.860]   that you're just not, you don't like worry about it.
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:01.060]   Or you're not touched, like the fear of that,
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:04.180]   the anxiety of that, the unpleasantness of that
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.220]   just doesn't hit you.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:09.300]   - I think that's also at least part of it, maybe all of it.
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.140]   - Yeah.
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:11.340]   - Yeah, I think there's some evidence for it.
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.140]   I think often guys will do a thing to me,
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:15.260]   and I'm just like, that's a thing, cool.
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.340]   I don't have any negative response whatsoever.
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:20.660]   - That's call back to the tire.
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:22.140]   It's a thing, this is nice.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:22.980]   - Yeah. - That happened.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:24.460]   It was good to know that can happen.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.420]   - I once had a homeless guy ask me
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:27.780]   to come back to my place, baby,
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:29.580]   and I was like, this is fun.
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:30.420]   - Yeah.
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.980]   - I'm like, do you want me to, I love asking men,
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:33.420]   are you trying to get me to have sex with you?
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:36.380]   Just like saying it out front, and they'll be like, well.
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:40.500]   Usually they stop for a minute, they're like, well,
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.780]   yeah, I would like to have sex,
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:42.980]   and I'll be like, thanks for asking,
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:45.420]   but I'm not interested in having sex with you.
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.780]   How do you have a good day?
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:48.860]   And then I walk away.
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:49.860]   And that's great, I don't know.
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:51.780]   I have no issues with that interaction,
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.220]   but maybe this is the kind of thing
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.900]   that other women would find to be really offensive.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:56.100]   - So you have that conversation,
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.700]   and it doesn't turn into a threatening feel.
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:15:59.540]   - No.
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:00.380]   - Like with a homeless guy.
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:02.380]   - No, I've never had that happen, though.
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.460]   But I think there's just something,
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:04.540]   I think I'm doing something,
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.100]   like again, this is kind of accidental.
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.100]   I just am like this always,
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.140]   and I think I just happen to be like this at people,
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.540]   and they don't expect it.
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.060]   They don't expect me to be really nice
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:15.260]   while explicitly asking them what their intentions are.
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:17.140]   Like directly putting my finger on the thing,
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.860]   like, oh, you're trying to have sex with me,
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:21.340]   and then also not judging them for it.
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:23.220]   I think this throws people off a little bit
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:24.340]   so they don't get aggressive.
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.940]   They're like, oh, you're autistic or something.
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:28.740]   - Even the cloak of anonymity on the internet,
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:29.900]   you weren't getting the toxicity.
[01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:32.100]   - Yeah, I just think I'm just not reactive,
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.980]   and or maybe I'm giving off, I don't know.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:34.820]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.700]   Maybe it's both, maybe it's a feedback loop.
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.260]   So I just, I had a pretty good experience.
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.460]   I know not everybody did.
[01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:41.860]   Definitely people reported having antagonistic experiences,
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:44.420]   but when I was scamming, I generally really liked.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:46.700]   People were really nice to me, had a great time,
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:47.760]   made friends.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:52.740]   - So you also did OnlyFans, as you mentioned,
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:54.500]   and I read on a website,
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.020]   so this is very investigative reporting,
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:59.180]   that on some months,
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:03.340]   you've made over $100,000 on OnlyFans.
[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.620]   How did that feel?
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.460]   - Great, really great.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.380]   I mean, like,
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:12.660]   well, actually, because so much of your upbringing,
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:13.740]   you didn't have money,
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:16.500]   you had to struggle with the fact of your job and so on,
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:17.660]   maybe a good person to ask,
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:20.500]   can money buy happiness?
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:24.340]   - Well, I mean, I think you get like a resting set point
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:27.220]   of happiness, regardless of how much money you have,
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:30.360]   but money can buy being less stressed, I would say.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.900]   - Is there a lot of variation
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:37.900]   in the basic rest happiness for humans, in general?
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.940]   Like, is that a good thing to think about?
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:41.820]   - I mean, they've done some studies,
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:43.020]   but again, I'm not sure,
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:43.940]   I haven't actually read the studies,
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:44.860]   so maybe they didn't replicate,
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.300]   where they measured people before and after
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.460]   winning a bunch of money
[01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:50.420]   to see if their happiness was higher.
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:53.540]   I think by some measures it was, and by some it wasn't.
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.740]   - No, I mean, like, basically, almost genetically,
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:58.740]   so nature and nurture, but is there,
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.100]   let's say after you're 18,
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:04.620]   is there like some stable level of happiness
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.740]   that all the environmental genetic factors combine
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:09.380]   to create so that everything that life throws at you
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:11.620]   has to face that happiness?
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:12.700]   Like you mentioned earlier
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:15.020]   that I seem to be happy with a lot of stuff.
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:16.780]   So maybe I have a certain level,
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:18.220]   do other people have a lower level?
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:19.500]   Some people have higher level?
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:20.340]   - Yeah, definitely.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:22.260]   - Like, is that a useful,
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:25.420]   or is that a useful model of human beings?
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:27.580]   Or is it all ups and downs?
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:31.260]   Like, is it all, like, there's no stable--
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:32.180]   - Well, I mean, there's no combo, right?
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:34.180]   Like, I don't know, some people just are happier
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:36.980]   than others in general, and other people aren't.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:38.260]   But then you also have ups and downs.
[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:40.580]   Like, I'm sure you've experienced sadness sometimes
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:42.180]   and happiness the other times.
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:44.340]   - Like, if I actually were to integrate,
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:46.260]   so have an integral under the,
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:48.580]   the area under the curve,
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:50.260]   I don't know if I'm different than other people.
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:53.420]   Maybe I'm just like really focused on the happy moments
[01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:56.180]   and maybe feel the down moments most intensely,
[01:18:56.180 --> 01:19:00.500]   and maybe that, like, on average, it's all the same.
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.660]   Is that possible?
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:03.260]   - I mean, maybe?
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.540]   I just, I don't know.
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.820]   Like, I remember when I was a kid,
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:08.300]   my mom would call me Pollyanna all the time,
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.220]   'cause I was like finding the good in everything.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.060]   - Oh, yeah? - I'd be like,
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:11.900]   something bad would happen, oh, my.
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:12.720]   - So you were a happy kid?
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.560]   - I was a really happy kid, yeah.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.620]   - Even in the harsh conditions?
[01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:16.460]   - Yeah, I mean, like I said,
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:18.620]   like, I think the harshness comes from the bad meaning,
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.740]   like, and I had good meaning applied to it.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.540]   - So you were a stoic?
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:23.380]   - Yeah.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:25.700]   - With another book I'm reading next week,
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:28.300]   tune in, Marcus Aurelius, "Meditations."
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.960]   (both laughing)
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.540]   All right, all right,
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:37.100]   camming, 100K, so it felt good.
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:40.020]   So it's crazy, though, right?
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.700]   You can just, like, take clothes off
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.540]   in a creative way with some gnomes and make 100,000?
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.460]   - Yeah, I mean, there was a lot more to it than that,
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.460]   but yeah.
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:49.300]   - What was it, what's the process?
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:51.100]   - I mean, it's marketing.
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.620]   Like, so with only, with my free cams,
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.940]   I was unusual in that I decided to do,
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:57.500]   outside of the website marketing,
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.140]   I would, like, post on Reddit, right?
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.300]   This was very unusual at the time,
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.860]   but, like, only fans are structured such that
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.160]   they have almost no internal discovery whatsoever.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.340]   So if you want people to come to your page,
[01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:08.140]   you have to go out onto external websites
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:10.540]   and advertise for yourself directly.
[01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:11.460]   Very different model.
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:13.320]   And so this is something I had already been doing
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.240]   and already had practiced in,
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.660]   and so I think I was, like, already quite advanced.
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:16.900]   Like, I already had an account on Reddit
[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:19.020]   that was, like, seven years old at the time,
[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:22.100]   tons of, like, karma that means I could post in subreddits.
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:23.580]   I'd already been on Twitter for years,
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:24.820]   you know, like, posting actively.
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.500]   So I already had, like, presences
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.500]   on all these other platforms
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.140]   that really helped with the conversion.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:30.620]   - Reddit and Twitter?
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:32.900]   - Reddit, Twitter, FetLife, Instagram, TikTok.
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:34.980]   - And you were still advertising creatively?
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:35.820]   - So, yeah.
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:36.640]   - So, like, there's, like, sexuality,
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:39.660]   but there's also, like, creative sexuality.
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:41.140]   - Yeah. - And ideas, too.
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:43.180]   - Yeah, like, one of the really popular ones was
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:45.660]   I, like, molested myself as a mime
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:50.620]   using a, one arm through a jacket.
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:52.300]   And so the jacket looked like it was,
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:54.960]   (both laughing)
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:57.740]   the jacket looked like it was alive,
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:00.860]   and, you know, and that one did really well.
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:02.420]   - Did you, like, brainstorm with somebody?
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:04.980]   And, like, I recently got to hang out with Mr. Beast
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:09.380]   and sit on a session of brainstorming different ideas.
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:14.180]   I just envision you with, like, a team brainstorming.
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:17.580]   All right, how about we try the mime and the molesting thing?
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:19.180]   I don't know, it's too edgy.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:20.700]   (Dana laughing)
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:23.100]   - I wish, I think the team would have been a lot more fun.
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:23.940]   But no, it's just me.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.180]   Like, I had an apartment that looked, like,
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.740]   kind of like this, you know?
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:27.660]   You just sit alone, and you're like,
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:29.100]   "Well, that would be a good idea."
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.340]   And I'd seen, you just collect ideas over time, right?
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:34.260]   Like, I'd seen somebody doing a version
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:38.060]   of the, like, this animated hand act, like, when I was a kid.
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.420]   And it just always stuck in my head.
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:41.340]   And, like, one day I was like, "I bet I could do that."
[01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:43.180]   And then when I was trying to think of ideas to do
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:45.260]   as a sex worker, I was like, "Why don't I just try that?"
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:46.820]   And then it turned out to be, like,
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:48.940]   really, like, quite a viral hit.
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:52.100]   - Is there stuff, like you mentioned, too edgy?
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:54.420]   Like, Mr. Beast tries to keep it PG.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:55.260]   - Yeah.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.180]   - Do you try to keep it PG-13?
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:57.820]   - Well, with the sex advertising stuff,
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:01.020]   I mean, it's sex advertising, so it's obviously not PG-13.
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:02.740]   - I don't know these ratings.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:03.580]   What does even beyond that, R?
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.220]   - It's not family-friendly.
[01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.060]   It is X.
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.020]   Like, the one that I'm describing to you at some point,
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.500]   like, you can see my boob.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.580]   - So, is a boob is X?
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:13.020]   - A boob is, I guess.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:13.860]   - I thought R.
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:15.420]   I think you could show a boob in PG-13.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:16.740]   - Yeah, maybe X is, like, if you got
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:19.580]   some sort of rhythmic motion going on.
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:22.020]   - Maybe that sound, but the rhythmic motion not.
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:27.660]   You can have one or the other, but you can't have both.
[01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:28.500]   You have both.
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.340]   - That's when we hit the X, yeah.
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:31.180]   - Okay.
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.020]   - So, definitely not family.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:33.420]   I mean, with the sex advertising stuff,
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.700]   like, guys like vanilla shit.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:37.740]   Guys want basic, hot girl.
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.700]   You can do something, like, kind of sexy and creative,
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:40.740]   like getting abducted by gnomes,
[01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:42.180]   or, like, the self-molestation, right?
[01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:46.020]   But those are still pretty within the normal boundaries.
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:48.140]   - What do you mean, guys like vanilla stuff?
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:50.340]   - I mean, most guys like vanilla stuff.
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.380]   - What's vanilla stuff?
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:52.220]   - Like, hot girl being horny.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:54.980]   - See, we'll talk about fetish, fetishes.
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:58.980]   I think my Overton window on what is vanilla
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:03.100]   is expanding quickly after following your work.
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:04.620]   But, yeah, what's that?
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:07.020]   - I actually have done a lot of studies on what is vanilla.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.540]   Like, I've done a couple different surveys
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:10.780]   where I ask people, like, how taboo is this thing?
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:13.060]   And I have, like, a rating from least to most taboo.
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:15.340]   - By the way, I don't like, I don't appreciate
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:17.300]   the beauty of vanilla ice cream.
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:18.180]   - You don't?
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:19.500]   It is really good, though.
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.500]   - You eat vanilla ice cream?
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.060]   - I eat vanilla ice cream, yeah.
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.940]   - I think there's just so many more options.
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:27.060]   It's like the absence of creativity.
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.140]   - I mean, if you put in, like,
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:30.000]   some chocolate chips or something.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.500]   - Yeah, they already made it more interesting.
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:34.500]   It's a start.
[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:36.540]   Okay, so what's vanilla?
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:37.780]   And why do guys like vanilla?
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.940]   So hot girl doing hot girl things?
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:42.540]   What, like, on dressing and then having sex?
[01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:44.140]   - The thing that I found was most successful
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:47.620]   were frames where the man was framed as passive
[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:48.740]   and the woman as active.
[01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:51.580]   Or, like, for example, like, oh, you know,
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:53.700]   we got assigned to the same bunk
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.740]   at the breeding school or something.
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:58.500]   Or, like, oh, we're the last people on earth, right?
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:02.840]   Or, like, oh, no, you know, I desperately need somebody
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:05.740]   to, like, cure me with this disease and I need semen.
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.620]   So it's like, in any scenario where the guy
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:10.020]   just, like, finds himself such that the woman,
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:11.540]   like, desperately needs him for some reason
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:12.860]   and he doesn't have to do much,
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:14.780]   that is, like, typically one of the much
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:16.220]   more successful things.
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:18.420]   Like, guys like women falling into their lap.
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.780]   - What about the power dynamic?
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:23.920]   - So guys are less into power dynamics than women are.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.380]   And you can do power dynamics as long
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.300]   as it's, like, handed to them.
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.260]   Some guys, obviously, some guys are, like, very dominant
[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:31.660]   and, like, prefer, like, having to work.
[01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:32.500]   But this is the minority.
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.780]   Like, if you're trying to do, make 100K a month
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:37.180]   and you're trying to appeal to the widest group of people,
[01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:39.100]   the most effective advertising,
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.140]   you're not gonna be making the most money
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:42.060]   by being, like, particularly submissive.
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:44.200]   - So on the camming side, that's your,
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:49.700]   unlike, like, escorting or just personal relationships,
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:52.500]   you're trying to, you have an audience.
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.820]   You have, like, a theater full of people.
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:55.780]   - Like, with live camming?
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:56.620]   - Yeah, with live camming.
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:58.460]   - Yeah, it's like a live theater.
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:24:59.280]   - Does that freak you out,
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.420]   there's just a bunch of people watching?
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:02.740]   - How do you feel right now?
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:05.620]   - I don't know they're watching, 'cause it's not live.
[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:06.900]   - Yeah, that's true, it's not live.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:07.740]   - 'Cause they're not watching.
[01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:08.560]   - But, like, it might as well be.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.980]   Like, they could be watching.
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:11.660]   - I feel like there's just the two of us.
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:12.500]   I don't know.
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.060]   And there's, like, sometimes I imagine
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:15.180]   there's a third person.
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:16.020]   - Like God?
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:17.580]   - Usually, no, no, not God, just,
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:21.900]   I usually imagine either a guy or a girl or a couple
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:23.420]   just sitting there for some reason,
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:26.020]   like, usually on the beach and usually high,
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.660]   or on some kind of, like, mushrooms,
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:29.420]   just, like, listening passively,
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:31.460]   just kind of looking at the sunset, that's what I imagine.
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.580]   - Oh, that's really good.
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:33.420]   - Yeah.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.260]   - I think that's useful.
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:35.220]   Like, when I write my blog posts,
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:38.180]   sometimes I do terribly, but it's the most effective
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:39.860]   when I imagine one person that I'm writing to
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:40.820]   to try to explain.
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:43.140]   And, like, having a high couple watching the sunset
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:46.060]   is maybe really lovely as a calibration.
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.620]   - I have to say, it is pretty romantic,
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:50.580]   'cause I've gotten a chance to meet couples
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:52.740]   that listen to podcasts together.
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:54.980]   I don't know why, that seems, like,
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:56.980]   intensely romantic to me, because, like,
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:00.820]   'cause you're not watching TV together,
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.780]   you're listening to a thing.
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:03.980]   I mean, I guess sometimes they watch it,
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.460]   but, like, you're listening to ideas together.
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.380]   I don't know.
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:11.220]   It seems--
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:12.060]   - It's like you're going through the same kind
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:12.880]   of thought process at the same time.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.580]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a really beautiful way to put it.
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:16.700]   So it's like, you're melding,
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:19.020]   your thinking is following the same line.
[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:21.020]   Some of our podcasts do that more than movies.
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:22.340]   I think movies give you a lot more freedom
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:23.620]   to think about stuff.
[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:26.060]   I feel like your thoughts are aligned.
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:28.020]   And, like, especially if the podcast is good,
[01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:32.060]   like, if it's listening to, like, a Dan Carlin podcast,
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:33.340]   like, about history, that you're, like,
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:34.660]   on a journey together.
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:37.220]   Eh, there's an intimacy to that.
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:38.780]   Anyway.
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:42.780]   But I've learned that couples do that, you know?
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:44.340]   #relationshipghost, go ahead.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:46.500]   - That's what you want with your future wife?
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:47.620]   - With my, yeah.
[01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:49.420]   - You should make an application.
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:50.260]   - Application?
[01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:51.300]   - An application for dating you.
[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:52.500]   I mean, maybe this is more of, like,
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:53.660]   my strategy and less yours,
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:56.300]   but you have, like, a wide enough audience that might work.
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:59.260]   - It's not...
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:04.380]   Okay, let's just go there.
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:06.060]   So, 'cause you've put together an application
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:08.660]   of, like, people to have casual sex with you,
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:09.500]   I think, you've had that.
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:10.700]   - And also dating, yeah.
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:12.220]   - And also dating and relationship.
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:14.540]   I'd love to, so what is in that application?
[01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:16.940]   'Cause, like, you know,
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:20.460]   I'm sure there's quite a lot of people
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:24.220]   that would like to date you or to sleep with you,
[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:26.980]   but finding the person, I mean, it depends what your goals,
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:29.340]   I guess relationship would be an open relationship for you?
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:30.180]   - Yes.
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:34.300]   - Right, like, for me, I guess it's more intensely selective
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.380]   because it's, like, a monogamous relationship
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:37.940]   and a committed one.
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:42.940]   Like, I'm swinging for the,
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:43.860]   - Yeah.
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:44.900]   - Like, for, like, long-term.
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:49.020]   I'm not, like, weirdly obsessed with long-term,
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:51.380]   but it's, like, I would love to have one girl
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:52.620]   for the rest of my life.
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:56.500]   But finding that, I feel like applications
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:57.340]   will not get to that.
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:27:59.380]   I feel like there's some aspect of the magic
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:01.420]   of the serendipity of it,
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:03.900]   of meeting people in strange places and so on.
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:05.780]   I just, I personally have noticed that, like,
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.900]   fame has not made that process easier.
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.540]   - But, I mean, like, if you could, you know,
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:11.820]   if there's two rooms and one of them,
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:13.980]   it's, like, a random population of hot women
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:15.860]   and the other one is a random population of hot women,
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:18.140]   but all of them definitely are monogamous
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:20.020]   and are looking for a long-term committed relationship.
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:20.860]   - Yeah.
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:22.380]   - Like, which room would you rather go into?
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:25.060]   Like, if you're looking for a mate.
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:27.620]   - Yeah, well, but see, I guess my preferences are more,
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:29.540]   that's a really strong point,
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:33.340]   but my preferences represent the majority, probably, right?
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.660]   'Cause don't most women want monogamous relationships?
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:36.500]   - Yeah.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.780]   - So, like, it's, I'm okay with either option.
[01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:42.060]   'Cause, like, statistically speaking.
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:42.940]   - But I feel like we can apply it
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.420]   to, like, a bunch of other things.
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:46.540]   Yeah, and this is just a problem if you have, like,
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.700]   high, if you have a high volume to filter through
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:49.540]   and, like, you don't know.
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.860]   Like, it's a good, like, initial filter.
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:53.740]   Like, you can take it from, like, a thousand people
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:55.380]   to 20 people and then go on dates with them.
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:57.340]   - But the filter is so anti-romantic.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:58.860]   Like, what?
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:28:59.700]   - This is true.
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:00.940]   This is not the romantic narrative
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:02.780]   that you are very prone to.
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:05.620]   - Like, if I feel like, how did you two meet?
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:08.060]   - Well, she passed the three filters I set up.
[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:12.860]   And, I mean, but it's also,
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:16.700]   but also, can you put into a survey
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:18.860]   the things that you're interested in?
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:20.780]   - Yeah.
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:22.820]   - I mean, I definitely think about this a lot with hiring.
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:25.140]   Like, teams, engineers, and so on.
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:30.900]   But with engineers, you're okay losing
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:35.540]   truly special engineers because you have to filter
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:37.660]   'cause there's, like, thousands of applications.
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:38.740]   Like, it feels like,
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:43.020]   it feels like a worry that you would miss the thing
[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:46.180]   that actually, 'cause so much of it is chemistry.
[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:47.860]   So much of it is, like, the magic, you know?
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:49.820]   - But the thing is, you're missing it anyway.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:50.660]   - Yeah, you're missing it.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:51.820]   - It's, oh, you can just run it,
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:55.020]   and then, in addition, try some of those people.
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:57.100]   And then go on the dates that you were going to go on
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.780]   with anyway, regardless.
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:29:59.940]   It's just the thing that helps, like,
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:01.180]   pull someone out of the crowd.
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:03.100]   Like this, I dated a guy from my survey.
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:03.940]   I'd ran the survey.
[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:06.540]   I assigned point values to each of the questions.
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.260]   I went on a date with, like, the top couple people,
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:10.260]   and then one of them, I was like,
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.020]   and I'm still dating him to this day.
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.460]   It was awesome.
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:15.700]   And I would never, I never would have gone on a date
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:16.820]   with him without the survey.
[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:19.460]   - Can you, if from memory, or we can look it up,
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:21.500]   do you remember what kind of questions were on the survey?
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.740]   - I asked a couple different categories.
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:24.020]   I asked about, like, basic life stuff.
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:25.460]   So, like, what kind of relationships,
[01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:26.820]   like, monogamy versus polyamory.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:28.260]   Like, do you want kids?
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:29.700]   You know, like, where you want to live.
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:32.220]   Like, basic things that you need to be compatible.
[01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:34.100]   And then I asked, like, sexual compatibility,
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:35.740]   like, various preferences.
[01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:37.580]   And then I had a section about, like, personality.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:39.380]   Like, what are, I try to ask questions
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:41.220]   that would do the most effective filtering.
[01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:42.980]   So, like, what are ways that, like,
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:45.700]   I can't give people what they need
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:47.340]   that, like, maybe they really want?
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:49.660]   Like, I don't really, I'm not very outdoorsy.
[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:50.500]   It was just very common.
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:51.340]   A lot of people like being outdoorsy.
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:52.180]   So, I asked the question, like,
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:53.900]   how much do you value someone else
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:55.460]   that you're dating being outdoorsy?
[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:57.100]   And if they remarked yes, I was like, okay,
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:59.220]   we probably, I should probably downgrade the results.
[01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:02.180]   - Man, but doesn't polyamory make that really difficult?
[01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:05.260]   'Cause can't they find somebody for the outdoorsy stuff?
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:06.100]   - Yeah, they could.
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:07.340]   I mean, this isn't, like,
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:09.060]   but if you're going to have somebody,
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:09.900]   it's, like, nicer to have them
[01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:11.700]   be more compatible than less.
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.700]   - But you were a little bit, like,
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:15.540]   in terms of sexual compatibility,
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:19.020]   you were able to, like, yourself aware enough
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:20.820]   to know what preferences you have?
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:22.740]   Like, you can-- - I think so.
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:24.780]   I think that one helped a lot with the escorting.
[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:25.700]   Like, the escorting helped a lot
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:26.860]   with knowing my preferences.
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:29.220]   - But there's, like, out of the giant pool
[01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:31.180]   of different preferences, you have, like,
[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:34.140]   a subset that's clearly defined for you?
[01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:37.220]   Okay, like, like, dominant/submissive.
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:38.340]   - Yeah, power dynamics stuff.
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:40.940]   - Power dynamics stuff. - Yeah.
[01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:43.900]   - Okay, and not just sexual, but in relationship, too.
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:45.100]   Like, was that in the survey?
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.100]   - I don't like power dynamics in relationships.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.740]   I did ask a lot-- - No, defining them in,
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:50.340]   like, making it clear in a survey,
[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:52.580]   like, asking a question about power dynamics
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:54.020]   in a relationship.
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:55.700]   - I don't think I asked about power dynamics
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:57.700]   in relationships. - Okay.
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:59.900]   - 'Cause I just assume most people don't.
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:01.460]   And there's a lot of things that are kind of, like--
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:02.380]   - Most people don't.
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:05.100]   You're putting together a survey,
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:08.060]   a systematic survey to understand compatibility.
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:11.820]   Wouldn't power dynamics inside of relationships
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:16.220]   that naturally emerge often be part of the question?
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:18.260]   Or is that hard to question
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:19.980]   because it naturally emerges and you can't really--
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:21.980]   - Well, the thing is, like, a lot of questions
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:23.660]   sort of overlap in demographic.
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:24.820]   And if you're making a survey,
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:26.660]   you wanna have the minimum possible questions
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:29.700]   that give the maximum possible, like, filtering information.
[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.340]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, wait a minute, wait a minute,
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:32.460]   wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:33.740]   But the purpose of that survey
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:35.620]   wasn't to do a good research study.
[01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:38.100]   It was to select one subject that you could take.
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:39.380]   - So that's part of what is good.
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.300]   Like, you want to most efficiently filter out.
[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:43.380]   'Cause one, like, you get more people taking the survey
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:44.460]   the fewer questions you have,
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:46.100]   which is good for finding a mate.
[01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:47.740]   Like, if you have 5,000 men take the surveys,
[01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.140]   better than 1,000 men take the surveys.
[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:52.500]   - Don't you want men that would be patient enough
[01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:53.900]   and dedicated enough to-- - Yeah, but, like,
[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:55.420]   what if you want, like, a high-powered man
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:57.460]   who's, like, on his lunch break, right?
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:59.100]   So it's like-- - Much like a billionaire
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:01.180]   who's too busy just flipping through.
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:02.300]   - Yeah. - And the guy that I did
[01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:05.060]   was, he took the survey, he was waiting for the pizza
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:05.900]   to come out of the oven.
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:08.100]   And so it was important that it was short.
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:08.940]   And so you want to be efficient.
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:10.540]   - Is it a metaphor or literally pizza coming out of the oven?
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:12.180]   - He was literally waiting for pizza,
[01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:13.420]   and he saw the thing, he's like,
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:15.140]   "I guess I'll just fill out the survey really fast,"
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:17.820]   and it changed our lives. - Wow, so romantic.
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:20.420]   - For me, this is my kind of romance.
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:21.740]   I'm really into it.
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:23.860]   But you can be efficient with surveys
[01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:25.700]   by, like, making sure your questions don't overlap.
[01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:27.740]   So, for example, if somebody's very polyamorous,
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.420]   they're very unlikely to be interested
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:33.220]   in a traditional man works and the job
[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:34.060]   and the woman stays home
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:35.500]   and raises the kids kind of relationship.
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.340]   'Cause poly people just generally don't do that.
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:38.940]   And so if I'm asking about polyamory,
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:41.380]   it sort of kind of already covers the thing.
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:42.980]   And so if I have a whole bunch of questions,
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.340]   I can kind of triangulate a bunch of implicit
[01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:48.220]   kinds of questions that I haven't directly asked about.
[01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:50.020]   So this is why I didn't ask directly about power dynamics,
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:52.980]   because from the rest of the questions that are in my survey,
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:55.020]   I can pretty accurately predict
[01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:57.500]   whether or not you're gonna be interested in power dynamics.
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.740]   - But I'm afraid, yeah,
[01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:02.500]   I'm trying to think as you're talking, I get it.
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:05.420]   That's really interesting that you did that.
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:08.540]   Also, maybe not for the effectiveness of finding a partner,
[01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:12.180]   but for just exploring the actual process
[01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:16.220]   of human sexuality, of like the search,
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:19.500]   this complicated optimization process we're all engaging in
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:21.340]   on the landscape of happiness
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:26.340]   that seems to be this not even a differentiable function.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.820]   It's a giant nonlinear mess.
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:31.940]   Okay, but like for me,
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:34.060]   I don't think I would be able to design that survey.
[01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:35.780]   I would like bias it too strongly.
[01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:40.260]   Like I would probably prefer women
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:42.420]   that have read Dostoevsky or something like that.
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:44.700]   Like that would be a filter for me, right?
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:46.260]   But like, that's a horrible filter.
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:49.780]   'Cause there's a lot of amazing people that have never,
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:51.140]   they don't give a shit about reading,
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:53.020]   or they don't give a shit about reading Russian literature,
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.300]   or they don't give a shit about,
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:55.700]   but they're amazing and passionate
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.980]   and creative in some other dimension
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.260]   that you might completely miss.
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:01.860]   But you were like, 'cause I wonder if there's any,
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:03.380]   basically you're saying compatibility,
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:06.420]   like hard lines that you know statistically
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:08.460]   is just going to be an issue.
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:10.220]   - Yeah, I mean, you weigh this a lot more.
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:11.060]   - Yeah.
[01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:11.900]   - But there's also like preferences.
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:13.740]   Like if you have a woman who's totally equal
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:15.140]   and she's read the thing that you like,
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:16.940]   versus another woman who's also identical,
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:18.980]   but like she hasn't read the thing that you like,
[01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:20.380]   like you probably like very slightly prefer
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:21.220]   the one that has. - But you don't know
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:22.140]   if they're identical, yes, yes.
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:24.220]   But like you can't through survey get the identical.
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:25.340]   Like you don't know.
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:27.660]   - Sure, but you can kind of like do a whole bunch of weight.
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:29.540]   So like the person that I ended up going on a date with,
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:33.220]   he did not answer correctly to a lot of the survey questions,
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:34.420]   but he didn't have to.
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:35.740]   Like he was just overall,
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:36.860]   overall the weights were like,
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:38.820]   he just tended to be more in the direction.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:41.500]   - Was there a text-based fill-in, like survey?
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.260]   But like, sorry, paragraph, like.
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:44.340]   - No, you ought to avoid that
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:46.860]   if you're dealing with large amounts of data.
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:47.700]   - No, why not?
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:50.980]   'Cause you have to fill, oh, oh, interesting, interesting.
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:52.380]   Like I'm different.
[01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:55.100]   'Cause like first of all, you do keyword searches.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:57.380]   Second of all, you do, you can do machine learning models
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:02.300]   that like, first of all, you can do like crude metrics,
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:03.460]   like the length.
[01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:05.900]   - That's a good point.
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:08.700]   - Of how long they've written, right?
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:10.940]   And it could flag certain things.
[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.540]   Yeah, it's actually pretty easy to,
[01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:14.460]   I've looked at like for hiring,
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:17.620]   I've looked at like thousands of applications really quickly.
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.900]   You can really, the human brain is really interesting,
[01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:24.900]   especially like if you visually highlight
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:28.660]   certain information for yourself, like keywords,
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:32.020]   or again, with machine learning models, like sentiment,
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.820]   you can highlight different parts
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:36.340]   that will catch your eye better than not.
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:39.180]   And I can go through just a huge number of applications.
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:40.300]   - Are you telling me I can use,
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:41.420]   if I learn machine learning,
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:44.740]   I can process dating survey applications better?
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:46.820]   - Yes, no, like textual.
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:48.700]   - Yeah, like I can like have them write things in.
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:50.500]   Like this is like a new way of,
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.500]   that's a really good incentive.
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:55.340]   I think that would, so it's a really nice aspect
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:59.740]   of text input, like long form text input,
[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:01.300]   multiple long form text input
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:04.420]   based on an interestingly phrased question
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:07.700]   is you get to learn how to make a better survey.
[01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:09.180]   I think you would appreciate that.
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:11.500]   Like you start to see how they're actually interacting
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:12.580]   with these questions.
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.940]   Like I asked certain questions,
[01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:16.340]   like just to see how people think,
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:19.080]   is it better to work smart or better to work hard?
[01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:26.460]   Or is it ever okay to betray a close friend?
[01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:30.620]   Like I'll ask like questions like this
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:31.900]   that don't really have a right answer,
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:33.060]   but I just wanna see how they think.
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:35.860]   Or is truth more important than loyalty?
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:36.900]   - Yeah.
[01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:39.060]   - And I get their long form answer.
[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:40.940]   - You get like, and you get to see their reasoning process.
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:44.740]   - Yeah, yeah, like what they, it reveals so much,
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:46.140]   not just about the person,
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:48.380]   but about the kind of questions I should be asking
[01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:50.460]   that have nothing to do with truth or loyalty.
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:52.020]   Like how to get a good engineer
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:53.660]   with like very specific questions.
[01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:56.220]   But I think it's really useful to get text input.
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.820]   - I have done text input usually with beta surveys.
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:00.860]   So I usually do beta surveys before I do the real survey.
[01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:01.700]   - What's a beta survey?
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:03.180]   - Like I do like a shorter version
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:04.460]   or it depends on what I'm doing,
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:06.820]   but like a different version of the survey
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:08.380]   that I have people take before I release.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:10.340]   I use the information from the initial survey
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:12.900]   to inform the questions that I ask in the real survey.
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:14.720]   And I haven't actually in recently,
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:17.180]   but I used to do a lot of like the text-based questions
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:18.620]   to see for similar,
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:20.540]   although I don't think I relied on it quite as heavily.
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:21.860]   And if I introduced machine learning,
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:23.780]   I think it'd be a lot more efficient.
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:25.460]   - I love that you're also doing like,
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:26.940]   you're writing scripts and stuff.
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:30.500]   Like you're doing some like statistical analysis.
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:32.060]   Are you using Python also?
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:35.500]   - Yeah, I had to learn Python for this
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.060]   just a couple months ago. - Which is the best way
[01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:38.180]   to learn Python.
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:40.420]   And the best reason to learn machine learning
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:43.220]   is to solve actual like problems.
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:44.260]   - I can't be motivated.
[01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:45.540]   I'm just not motivated to learn something
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:47.180]   unless there's an actual curiosity I have
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:48.580]   and I have to learn it and to solve it.
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:51.100]   I was trying to avoid learning coding for so long,
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:53.740]   but eventually it was my dataset became too large.
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.140]   I couldn't work with it with anything else.
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:57.540]   So, Python it is.
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:58.940]   - You know what's also an interesting dataset
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.860]   that you're probably interested in a little bit
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:02.820]   is like Twitter itself, right?
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:03.740]   I don't know if you've,
[01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:05.660]   I've played with the Twitter API a lot.
[01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:09.060]   - Can you just get the download?
[01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:12.020]   I'm just, I'm stuttering now because-
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.660]   - Download the Twitter?
[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:15.740]   You download Twitter?
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:17.780]   No, there's a lot of Twitter.
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:20.780]   So, Twitter is a social network with a bunch of people.
[01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:22.540]   They're interacting a lot.
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:25.740]   Like there's like, I don't know, the number is insane.
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:26.820]   The number of interactions,
[01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:30.780]   but there's different ways to interact
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:32.060]   to get data from Twitter.
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:33.940]   There's streams you can look at.
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:35.580]   It depends what you're interested in.
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:37.500]   You can do results for searches.
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:40.700]   You can look at individual tweets and get entire,
[01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:42.400]   which to me is super interesting,
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.980]   the entire tree of different conversations, the replies,
[01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:47.700]   which might be very interesting for you
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:50.600]   because like it's not,
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:54.540]   it's much harder to ask rigorous questions,
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.500]   which you do with your polls,
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.540]   but you could see like how divisive certain things are.
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:01.540]   - You could probably use like calibrators
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:03.180]   to figure out like exactly what questions
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.140]   you should be asking.
[01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:07.540]   - Yeah, and also highlight interesting anecdotal things
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:09.700]   where like two people freak out at each other
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:11.860]   and just argue like a thread that goes on
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:13.500]   for like a thousand messages
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:15.380]   that you might never be even aware is happening
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:16.340]   'cause you're like,
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:18.020]   'cause Twitter doesn't like surface that,
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:19.060]   like it would be,
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:21.100]   Twitter doesn't make it easy for you to like visualize
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:24.460]   what the hell's going on even with your own social network.
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:27.540]   Like if you post something that's controversial
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:29.980]   that gets a large amount of attention,
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:32.660]   you can't clearly visualize everything that's going on.
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:33.500]   - Yeah.
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:37.460]   - Like it's very, it's a blurry, amorphous,
[01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:39.460]   like you're just kind of looking through the fog
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:41.900]   at different replies and it kind of,
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:42.740]   yeah, so to be able to--
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:43.560]   - You see with the API,
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.940]   they have like graphs of networks?
[01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:47.620]   - They have the data for the graphs, yeah.
[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:49.380]   So you can reconstruct to yourself.
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:50.220]   Yeah.
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:51.620]   And then you have different levels of access
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:54.700]   in terms of how many queries you can do.
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:55.820]   - That is really cool.
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:58.300]   - And now, because there's like Elon,
[01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:03.220]   there's a lot of sort of revolutionary stuff
[01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:04.060]   happening at Twitter.
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:08.260]   I think you could literally sort of push for innovation there
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:10.920]   like there's aggressive innovation happening.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:13.860]   So in terms of requesting stuff for the API,
[01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:15.000]   you could do all that kind of stuff.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.140]   I think Twitter's just a fascinating platform
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:21.500]   for the, as cliche as it sounds, for studying.
[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.740]   For me, it's interesting,
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:25.880]   what makes for a healthy conversation.
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:26.900]   That term has been used,
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:28.780]   but it's interesting how conversation,
[01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:31.900]   to me, it's fascinating how conversations break down
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:36.900]   and not, like how, like the virality of drama
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:42.180]   or conflict or disagreement,
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:45.940]   how that evolves when a large number of people are involved,
[01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:50.940]   when a large number of misinterpretation of statements
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:55.100]   is involved in text-based with some anonymity thrown in.
[01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:56.440]   Like, I feel like there's a lot of study
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:57.280]   that can be done there.
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:59.520]   - I mean, Twitter's probably not great at it, right,
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.560]   as it stands.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:01.400]   - No.
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:02.580]   - 'Cause it's like necessarily short.
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:05.040]   You can quote, treat things out of context, et cetera.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.400]   - But we should understand that, right?
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.240]   - Yeah.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:09.680]   - At a large scale, you should be able to study
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:10.800]   that kind of thing.
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:14.620]   Oh yeah, what was your casual sex survey?
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:16.260]   - I actually haven't looked at it in a while.
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:18.500]   I think I just asked people about a whole bunch of fetishes,
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:19.860]   'cause you don't wanna be obvious about yours
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:21.300]   because then people are gonna hijack it
[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:24.340]   to try to tell you that they like what you like.
[01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:25.220]   So you wanna be obscure.
[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:26.260]   So how do you design a survey
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:27.100]   where you're testing for a thing,
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:28.180]   but you're still obscure about the thing
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:29.460]   you're trying to ask about?
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:31.820]   - So you still see it as a survey?
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:32.660]   - Yeah.
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:34.340]   - Like an application?
[01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:35.940]   'Cause I think you tweeted saying,
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:37.780]   I'm thinking of just showing up to San Francisco
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:41.960]   and saying, is anybody open for casual sex?
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:42.800]   - Yeah. - Something like this?
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.460]   Am I misremembering?
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:45.980]   - Maybe escorting, I'm not sure.
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:47.460]   - Oh, for escorting, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:48.340]   - Which is similar.
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:49.740]   Like I kind of use escorting
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:51.580]   as the way to have casual sex now.
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:56.000]   - Okay, so let's talk about escorting.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.540]   So you wrote about escorting in your blog post.
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:00.020]   Escorting was good for me.
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:04.020]   How did you get into escorting?
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:05.740]   - I was working at like a,
[01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:07.780]   I quit camming 'cause I was burned out
[01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:09.780]   and I was like trying to work at a friend's startup
[01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:12.460]   and it was hard for me.
[01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:14.360]   It's difficult for me to work on projects
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:15.660]   that are not my projects.
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:18.340]   And so I was like, hey, fuck it.
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:19.540]   Like I wanna go back to sex work,
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:20.360]   I wanna make more money,
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.700]   but I don't wanna cam anymore 'cause I'm burned out.
[01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:22.780]   So I'm like, well, let's try,
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:23.980]   I had a friend who was an escort.
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:24.820]   I'm like, let's try that.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:27.540]   And so we had a call, she like outlined the basics for me
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:30.820]   and then I put up some ads and then started working.
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:32.340]   - What's the basics of escorting?
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:33.180]   How does that work?
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:34.620]   - If you wanna get started escorting,
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:37.620]   so just in case you have a career change.
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:38.820]   We're gonna want you to get some nice photos.
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:39.820]   So you probably have those.
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:43.100]   - First of all, you assumed I haven't done it before.
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:44.460]   How rude. - Oh, have you?
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:45.960]   - Yeah, well, you know,
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:49.620]   recreation I would like to do professionally, I suppose.
[01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:50.820]   So if I wanted to do it,
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:55.940]   if I really wanna step up my game, how would I do it?
[01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:59.020]   - Yeah, well, you got the whole tutorial.
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:02.880]   Recreational escorting is just,
[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:05.260]   - Okay, okay.
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:06.460]   - No, I'm meaning like,
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:12.100]   you know, like selling products on Etsy
[01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:15.900]   versus doing a startup, you know?
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:17.700]   - Well, I mean, escorting is kind of all
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.260]   just selling products on Etsy.
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:21.340]   - No, like selling a lot of products on Etsy.
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:22.660]   - Like high volume.
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:24.940]   He's like dabbled.
[01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:26.820]   - Yeah, like, yeah, yeah.
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:30.380]   - Small handcrafted artisan. - It's small handcrafted dolls.
[01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:32.180]   Yeah. - Escorting.
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:33.800]   - Versus mass manufacture.
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:37.540]   - Okay, if you wanna mass manufacture your escorting.
[01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:39.540]   - I just feel like I haven't been getting,
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:42.780]   you know, I've been undervaluing my services
[01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:44.460]   and I would like to really step up.
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:45.820]   - I think you could really just like
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:48.340]   grease some marketing gears and be trustworthy.
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:50.440]   - Yeah, I mean, so some of this is marketing.
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:53.420]   So like how, I guess I wanna like know,
[01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:54.900]   is it similar to camming in that way?
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:57.980]   Like, is it you're basically advertising yourself
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:44:58.820]   and you're,
[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:02.980]   like the marketing, all the creativity
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:04.900]   that you mentioned before, all of that?
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.500]   - Yeah, I found escorting to be pretty easy
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:09.460]   because escorting is not like highly competitive.
[01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:10.900]   For example, camming is highly competitive
[01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:13.580]   because like the thing that I outlined before,
[01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:14.420]   you know, the amount of money
[01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:15.940]   that you make determines your ranking.
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:17.740]   And you can also go and see other girls.
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:18.860]   You can see what they're doing.
[01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:20.500]   So if a girl figures out an incredible strategy
[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:22.220]   for making money, it's like two seconds
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.660]   before that strategy perlithoits into everybody else.
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:26.980]   So it's very fast paced and like really tough.
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:28.220]   With escorting, you don't get to see
[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:29.300]   what other girls are doing.
[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:30.300]   You can look at their websites,
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:31.340]   but like you don't know what they're doing
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:32.940]   with clients at all.
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:33.860]   You can look at their rates,
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:35.140]   but you don't know what their volume is.
[01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:37.380]   So you don't actually know what is successful
[01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:39.180]   and what isn't very much.
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:41.940]   So I think there's much less like evolution
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:43.820]   of marketing through this process.
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:46.820]   And so I came in with like my aggressive marketing skills
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:47.700]   for being a cam girl.
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:48.740]   I think that really helped.
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:50.820]   I did very well as an escort.
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:52.580]   I just came in and like made a fantastic website
[01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:54.340]   and I knew how to do the ads right.
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:58.020]   - What was the finding people,
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:01.100]   I guess it's also like finding the right kind of customer
[01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:02.220]   or the right kind of client.
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:04.420]   - I got like in a lot of trouble for this recently
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:06.420]   in the sex worker sphere, because I said that
[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:08.620]   if you raise prices, you're more likely to encounter clients
[01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:10.540]   that aren't going to abuse you.
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:11.500]   Like it's safer.
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:15.420]   They did not, they said that I was being classist,
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:17.540]   you know, implying that poor people are more violent.
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.260]   But to be fair, if you're a guy
[01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:20.620]   and you want to be violent towards a woman,
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:22.140]   you're probably not gonna be paying her a lot of money.
[01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:22.980]   You're probably gonna be like,
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:25.420]   you're the kind of person likely who's going to haggle a lot
[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:27.100]   'cause you don't respect her.
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:29.820]   But anyway, that aside, it's a little pet peeve for me.
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:33.100]   Yeah, I just, I charged, started charging 800 an hour
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:35.060]   and then pretty rapidly raised it to 1200.
[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:37.980]   And then a while after that, raised it to 1400.
[01:46:37.980 --> 01:46:39.860]   - Well, the interesting thing you mentioned
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.140]   in my extensive research,
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:46.660]   you used to do 1200 to 1400 an hour.
[01:46:46.660 --> 01:46:48.860]   And then you said that you're thinking of jumping back in
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:53.220]   at a rate of 2400 the first hour.
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:54.060]   - Yeah.
[01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:57.020]   - And I think 900 each successive hour.
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:58.820]   - That's interesting.
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:01.140]   That's like, I mean, to me, that's really interesting.
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:02.820]   Like the first, like why?
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:05.900]   It's like a lot in the first hour, yeah.
[01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:07.620]   - Oh, it's just because,
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:09.740]   it depends on how you want to incentivize
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.140]   like the amount of hours.
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:12.500]   So if you have to pay a lot for the first hour,
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:13.620]   but not very much for the successive,
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:16.180]   you're more likely to buy like a longer period of time.
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:17.940]   And usually I find that clients who buy
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:21.300]   a longer period of time are nicer to you.
[01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:22.860]   I don't have like a great theory for why that is,
[01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:24.300]   but they're more likely to like take you to dinner
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:25.140]   and get to know you first.
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:26.420]   And I just enjoy that a lot more.
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:30.300]   I enjoy like knowing who I'm gonna have sex with.
[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:32.700]   Like a date, you know?
[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:36.420]   - Yeah, so it incentivize the long form date dynamic
[01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:38.820]   versus like not.
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:40.700]   That's really interesting.
[01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:41.540]   That's really interesting.
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:45.140]   How does money change the dynamic?
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:47.340]   Just basic human dynamic of interacting
[01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:49.180]   for free versus for money.
[01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:50.260]   Like I think about that a lot.
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:52.300]   It's like just talking to rich people.
[01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:54.380]   It's like you usually get paid for your time
[01:47:54.380 --> 01:47:56.180]   and you're doing this for free.
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:48:00.380]   Like what's the difference?
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:02.100]   Is there a difference really or no?
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:02.940]   - A bit, yeah.
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:04.620]   So I've actually, it depends a lot.
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:06.260]   So when I was doing it full time,
[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:07.860]   it was my only source of income.
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:11.060]   It changed quite a lot because I was really incentivized
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:12.380]   to have repeat customers.
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:15.420]   So I'm like, okay, my primary interaction with you
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:17.380]   is to like have you hire me again.
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:19.180]   I'll do whatever that takes to make that happen.
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:20.700]   And so if I have to like laugh at jokes
[01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:23.780]   that I don't find funny or like be like more adoring
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:25.660]   of your penis than I actually genuinely feel,
[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:27.500]   like that's what I'm going to express.
[01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:30.260]   And obviously it's to some degree like titrated,
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:32.460]   you know, like it's unpleasant to force yourself
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:33.500]   to like something that you don't.
[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:36.100]   So like I would actually like not see clients again
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:36.940]   that I didn't want to.
[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:39.340]   But to some degree there was a sort of self-suppression
[01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:41.340]   going on, which I think is the way it works
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:43.100]   in any sort of customer service job.
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:44.780]   Like you want the customer to leave happy.
[01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:46.860]   So you just make sure that you are happy the whole time
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:49.340]   and you're like, ah, really enjoying the other person.
[01:48:49.340 --> 01:48:52.540]   But so recently when I've like kind of dabbled in it
[01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:56.660]   since baking money through other means,
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:58.020]   where I don't need the money,
[01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:01.060]   it's more like a fun side thing that like,
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:03.420]   like I said, it's fulfilling the role of casual sex for me.
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:04.740]   So like, I don't have to do it.
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:06.020]   This is not my primary job.
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:07.620]   I just want sort of a good excuse
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:09.300]   to like have sex with somebody.
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:11.540]   And the money is like a great filter for that.
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:12.740]   And so in that case--
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:13.580]   - That's interesting.
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:14.620]   So the money is just, yeah, okay.
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:16.220]   The money is basically a filter for somebody
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:17.620]   who's taking this interaction seriously.
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:18.500]   - Yeah.
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:20.940]   It also, so there's an interesting like psychological thing
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:23.060]   where I have difficulty having casual sex with somebody
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:24.620]   because some part of my brain,
[01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:26.220]   which I assume is like quite female,
[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:27.860]   is doing some evaluation of status
[01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:30.420]   and whether or not this is going to damage my reputation
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:31.660]   by having sex with them.
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:33.180]   So like if you found out that I went
[01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:35.300]   and like had random sex with like a homeless man,
[01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:37.300]   you might be like, wow, that says something about Ayla.
[01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:38.540]   Like maybe she's, you know, trashy
[01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:41.100]   or she just has no standards for who she's gonna fuck.
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:43.860]   But if, and so some part of me is continually anxious.
[01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:46.020]   I'm like, does this mean I have no standards
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:47.620]   if I decide to have casual sex with you?
[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:49.180]   Like, what are people going to think?
[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:52.260]   And so if you introduce money, it takes away that anxiety.
[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:54.340]   I don't have to worry about it because it's like,
[01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:55.900]   oh, of course Ayla would have sex with that person.
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:56.740]   They paid her.
[01:49:56.740 --> 01:49:57.740]   Like, this is not an indication
[01:49:57.740 --> 01:49:59.900]   of the kind of mate that she can get.
[01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:02.300]   This is just an indication of like a business transaction.
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:05.580]   And this allows me to enjoy casual sex so much more
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:06.860]   when somebody pays me for it.
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:09.580]   To the degree that like I almost view it as a kink.
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:11.380]   And so it's like, so I'm using it sort of
[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:12.500]   to replace casual sex now.
[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:14.460]   Like occasionally I'm like, gosh, you know,
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:16.500]   like it's paying me a little bit to erase the anxiety
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:18.820]   and I'll like have a fun time.
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.140]   - In case you see like dinner like that
[01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:22.460]   or something like that, if the person pays for dinner
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:26.380]   or like, so like it's all just, if any money's involved,
[01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:28.880]   if it's a kink, then you could just like use it.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:32.100]   And you, buys a coffee at a Starbucks.
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:33.140]   It's like, all right.
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:34.340]   - Right, but it has to be plausible.
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:35.980]   Like you have to like trick my brain
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:38.500]   into like having it actually be incentivizing for me.
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:39.340]   - Two coffees?
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:40.740]   Like a cappuccino or something?
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:42.300]   - Yeah, like the homeless man bought me a coffee
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:43.140]   and then I sucked his dick.
[01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:44.400]   Like, that's not cool.
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:46.140]   - All right, so I--
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:47.660]   - No shade to homeless men, by the way.
[01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:48.940]   Like I've been friends with a lot of them.
[01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:51.820]   I'm just using like some sort of stereotype of--
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:52.660]   - Yeah.
[01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:53.480]   (laughs)
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:54.860]   So like it has to be plausible
[01:50:54.860 --> 01:50:55.980]   where you could trick your mind.
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:56.820]   Interesting.
[01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:57.640]   - Yeah.
[01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:58.900]   - I mean, yeah.
[01:50:58.900 --> 01:50:59.740]   - And so that's different.
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:03.060]   So now within this sort of frame, I am still like,
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:05.340]   I'm accepting money, but still much more expressive
[01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:07.060]   of my actual preferences.
[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:09.820]   So like before when I would start escorting full-time,
[01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:10.640]   I was suppressive.
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:11.900]   And now I'm like, you know, fuck it.
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:13.500]   I'm doing this for me.
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:16.140]   So we're going to make sure that I have a good time.
[01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:18.340]   And so I'm much more demanding.
[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:19.500]   - And then you're having more fun
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:20.340]   'cause you're not pretending.
[01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:21.160]   - Exactly.
[01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:22.000]   - Like laughing at a joke or something like that.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.660]   That sounds terrible.
[01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:24.500]   Sounds like--
[01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:25.340]   - I mean, it's--
[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:26.420]   - But it's also like social.
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:30.140]   I mean, I guess I would, would I do that?
[01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:32.780]   Like when you first meet people like strangers and so on,
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:36.100]   there's some aspect of like niceties,
[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:38.020]   but like, I don't know, intimacy,
[01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:41.380]   like real intimacy requires like getting past the niceties.
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:43.780]   Like laughing at somebody's joke when it's not funny
[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:45.580]   feels like anti-intimacy.
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:48.820]   - Yeah, but I laugh at so many jokes automatically.
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:50.580]   It's interesting 'cause like I don't mean to,
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:52.020]   I'm not trying to be fake,
[01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:53.220]   but like if I'm in a group of people
[01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:54.580]   and somebody makes a joke and everybody laughs,
[01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:56.580]   I laugh even before I'm checking within myself,
[01:51:56.580 --> 01:51:58.580]   like do I genuinely enjoy this joke?
[01:51:58.580 --> 01:51:59.820]   So it's like, I don't know,
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:02.340]   like the degree that I am sort of just like a result
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:04.900]   of social programming in all cases,
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:06.580]   that like when I'm with a client
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:07.700]   back when I was doing it full-time,
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:09.220]   like it doesn't feel significantly different.
[01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:11.620]   It just felt like a different version of myself.
[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:12.460]   - Yeah, that's true.
[01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:13.540]   Yeah, to that degree.
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:17.420]   To the degree you don't feel like you're going against
[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:19.380]   - Yeah. - your nature.
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:20.540]   Yeah. - Yeah, it was very rare
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:23.440]   that I actually felt like I was going against my nature.
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:27.300]   - What about the market of how much to charge?
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:30.900]   So you're 2400, like how transparent is that market?
[01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:32.620]   Is there like a market?
[01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:34.060]   - Like how much can you sell
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:35.460]   when you're charging that much?
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:37.300]   - Yeah, no, like what are the competitors?
[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:38.580]   Like if this-- - Oh yeah.
[01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:40.300]   - Like what do you, are you distinctly,
[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:42.140]   'cause you said it's a lot of,
[01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:44.620]   it's a bit more shrouded in mystery.
[01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:46.420]   Like it's more confidential.
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:48.700]   Like do you have some transparency to the market,
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:49.540]   what the competitors are?
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:51.020]   - I did a survey of Escort.
[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:52.020]   It's only like 130.
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:54.900]   I'm trying to remember, and the median was around like $400,
[01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:57.000]   $300 I think an hour.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:57.840]   - Oh wow.
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:00.260]   - Something like that with a very long tail at the top end.
[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:01.260]   I'm trying to remember what the,
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:03.260]   I also asked the amount where I could calculate
[01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:04.100]   the amount they made per month.
[01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:06.660]   I think it was like six or $7,000 a month.
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:08.300]   I need to double check that one, but.
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:09.860]   - I charge 50 bucks an hour.
[01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:10.780]   - You charge 50 bucks an hour?
[01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:11.940]   You should raise your rates.
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:14.440]   - Yeah, I believe I gave a really shitty hand job.
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:16.940]   All right.
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:18.420]   - But usually the rates are around,
[01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:20.520]   like if you want a median Escort in a big city,
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:21.360]   it's usually four to $600.
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:24.580]   - A city, so the, sorry, four to 600?
[01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:26.260]   - In a big city, but like smaller cities,
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:28.460]   you charge, the rates go lower.
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:33.420]   - That's so fascinating.
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:36.260]   What's like the most you've ever seen somebody charge?
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:40.540]   - I think I am.
[01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:41.800]   - You're like the.
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:45.460]   - But at this point it's because I'm post work.
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:48.100]   Like I can just put in a state number.
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:50.820]   - Does like, does the fact that you're sort of
[01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:56.180]   like a sexuality expert, like a researcher and so on,
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:57.980]   like your mind is fascinating as well,
[01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:01.380]   and you're a bit of a celebrity, does that play into it?
[01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:02.860]   - Yeah.
[01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:04.260]   - Or do you feel the celebrity now?
[01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:06.380]   Like when you're with people?
[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:07.500]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:09.580]   Usually if people are interested in hanging out with me,
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:10.580]   it's because of that.
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:14.340]   But that's different.
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:17.380]   Like I think besides the fun part,
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:20.020]   like this is a kink as opposed to this is a job,
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:21.060]   like with this as a job,
[01:54:21.060 --> 01:54:24.060]   usually the high end is closer to 2000 an hour,
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:25.260]   like the very high end.
[01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:28.000]   - Have clients ever fallen in love with you?
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.300]   - I think so, yeah.
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:32.860]   I think it happens to me much less than most other people
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:33.700]   due to like the thing that I think
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:35.020]   we were talking about before.
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:35.860]   - Which is what?
[01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:37.140]   - Where like, you know, you give off vibes,
[01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:38.540]   maybe like subconscious vibes.
[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:42.420]   But they have fallen in love, but not as often.
[01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:44.700]   - I think something about my signaling
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:46.500]   indicates that people should not fall in love with me
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:48.340]   'cause I don't think it happens very much.
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:50.620]   And it happens a lot with other women that I know.
[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:52.580]   But I have occasionally had,
[01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:54.260]   the thing is it's hard for me
[01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:56.460]   because I try to be as vulnerable as I can
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:58.620]   in a connection with a client.
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:00.420]   And like I do really like some of them.
[01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:02.820]   I still remember some of them very fondly,
[01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:04.540]   and I'm like, I hope they're doing well.
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:06.060]   And some of them are really profound.
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:08.140]   Like one guy saw me because he found out
[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:09.340]   he was dying of cancer.
[01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:13.100]   And he was like, I don't wanna die without seeing someone.
[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:15.940]   I'm like, Jesus Christ, that's such a,
[01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:17.100]   I don't know, I'm very touched
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:19.140]   by many of the people that I saw.
[01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:21.300]   - So there's like deep intimacy there.
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:23.260]   - Yeah, I know that it's brief
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:24.900]   and I know that it's like kind of weird,
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:28.260]   but like there's like a real glimpse into somebody's soul
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:29.580]   when you get to be intimate.
[01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:31.180]   And I think this is especially true for men
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:32.860]   because a lot of time men don't have like a way
[01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:35.680]   to be really vulnerable in front of anybody.
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:37.380]   But like if you're in bed with a woman
[01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:38.780]   that you find to be attractive,
[01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:41.620]   you can sort of let loose a little bit more.
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:43.500]   - So they can become vulnerable in general quickly.
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:45.060]   - Yeah, and I really like that.
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:47.060]   I like being as vulnerable as I can to match it.
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:48.580]   Like I'm not forcing myself or anything,
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:50.180]   but like I just feel into it
[01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:53.180]   and like notice how beautiful the person was
[01:55:53.180 --> 01:55:55.220]   and like feel grateful for being able
[01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:58.100]   to be in this intimate experience with them.
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:00.380]   And that was so wonderful.
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:02.140]   - Does it ever hurt to say goodbye?
[01:56:02.140 --> 01:56:06.740]   - No, but I think that's unique to me
[01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:09.860]   because I like being alone a lot.
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:12.260]   Even with my friends who I like dearly,
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:13.700]   I'm like happy not seeing them
[01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:17.680]   'cause I don't like making facial expressions very much.
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:19.780]   But I do miss some of my clients.
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:20.660]   - Wait, sorry.
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:22.540]   What does making facial expression
[01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:24.580]   have to do with saying goodbye?
[01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:27.060]   - Well, if you are not with somebody in person,
[01:56:27.060 --> 01:56:29.340]   you don't have to make facial expressions anymore.
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:32.220]   - Oh, you can just think about them.
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:34.420]   - Yeah, you can just sit there, totally blank face,
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:37.140]   and then have all of the emotions that you want.
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:38.460]   - Oh, you're telling me.
[01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:39.940]   - Do you have this thing too?
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:43.740]   - It's not a thing, but like you're on camera.
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:45.580]   So like I feel feelings,
[01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:46.980]   but people usually want you,
[01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:50.380]   social interaction is such that
[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:53.580]   you probably want me to show feelings on my face.
[01:56:53.580 --> 01:56:55.260]   - Yeah, like that, good job.
[01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:57.540]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:59.780]   So like I definitely,
[01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:01.740]   there could be just an introvert thing
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:05.500]   where you like have a vibrant inner world
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:08.420]   that you forget to show to the rest of the world.
[01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:10.260]   And also I'm scared of social interaction.
[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:12.540]   And I just have a lot of anxiety
[01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:14.980]   about interacting with the external world, so yeah.
[01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:16.060]   - I'm kind of surprised to hear that
[01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:18.860]   because when you talked about finding the light
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:20.740]   and everything and everything is fun,
[01:57:20.740 --> 01:57:22.060]   like I usually don't associate that
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:24.620]   with having not very much anxiety.
[01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:27.980]   - Well, because I have the, we mentioned that earlier.
[01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:30.260]   I just appreciate the beauty in the world when I observe it.
[01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:33.860]   But then when I'm interacting with others,
[01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:36.740]   I have a very harsh self-critical aspect to my brain
[01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:40.100]   that says like, you're gonna fuck this up.
[01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:42.140]   You're gonna fuck up this interaction.
[01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:44.800]   You're gonna fuck up the beauty that's there.
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:49.420]   If I'm sort of being fragile and vulnerable for a moment.
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:50.260]   One of the things I'm afraid of,
[01:57:50.260 --> 01:57:54.020]   I get so much love from people that listen
[01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:55.060]   or even like reach out,
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:58.500]   like you said through the survey, like women and so on.
[01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:01.820]   I'm afraid that, yeah, you admire me
[01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:03.180]   because you don't know me,
[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:05.100]   but you won't admire me once you know me.
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:07.700]   So that's self-critical, but it's a silly,
[01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:10.140]   I mean, as you get older, you're like, yeah, okay.
[01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:13.460]   Like I'm able to step away and objectively look at myself
[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:16.260]   as like, there's no, you're fine, you're good.
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:19.860]   But it's still, this is the part of the brain
[01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:21.420]   that you can't just shut off.
[01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:25.500]   - What would fucking up in this conversation look like?
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:28.300]   Like, it doesn't have to be rational,
[01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:30.900]   but I'm curious if there's like a specific thing.
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:38.420]   - A lot of it is just a feeling,
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:42.860]   like an amorphous fear of failure.
[01:58:42.860 --> 01:58:44.540]   What it would actually look like.
[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:53.260]   Maybe because we're talking about sexuality,
[01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:56.580]   me not being able to eloquently explain
[01:58:56.580 --> 01:59:01.300]   the worldview I have and why I appreciate it,
[01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:04.740]   that would make me feel like a failure
[01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:06.300]   because that would make me feel like
[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:08.900]   maybe you don't know what you're doing, right?
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:10.900]   'Cause sexuality, not sexuality,
[01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:13.660]   but even romantic relationships are really important
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:16.180]   to happiness, they're really important to me.
[01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:19.380]   And I'm not sure like the conception of love I have,
[01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:24.380]   romantic love, is like fully made rigorous.
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:26.380]   So especially when I'm talking to you,
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:29.180]   that thinks very rigorously about a lot of these topics,
[01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:32.620]   I'm not sure if I've thought about them a lot.
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:34.020]   I feel them.
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:36.880]   I interact with the world in the space of feelings.
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:39.700]   Maybe I'm almost afraid to be very rigorous
[01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:42.260]   with these kinds of thoughts.
[01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:46.460]   And so I think the failure would be like,
[01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:49.260]   I would be confronted with the fact that I can't explain
[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:52.580]   what makes me happy, that could be a failure.
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:54.500]   And there could be just a bunch of other failures.
[01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:56.620]   Another big failure is like,
[01:59:56.620 --> 02:00:00.260]   I think you're a really brilliant person.
[02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:06.060]   And a lot of folks I know, know and admire your work as well.
[02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:09.520]   And so like for me not to be part of highlighting
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:12.060]   that brilliance would be a failure definitely.
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:14.800]   - Like because then other people might feel like,
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:17.260]   like notice the discrepancy or something?
[02:00:17.260 --> 02:00:20.140]   - Yeah, but no, no, no, that's not other people,
[02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:22.820]   just my personal feeling.
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:24.820]   And the other is like jokes,
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:26.300]   'cause like we're talking about sex, right?
[02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:29.100]   So for me, like it's fun to just joke around,
[02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:30.780]   but you also have to tread carefully
[02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:34.900]   because like it's a weird surface
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:37.400]   because like, you know, even I already feel bad
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:39.600]   about making a joke for 50 bucks for a handjob
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:40.840]   that's crappy by me.
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:46.500]   But I think sometimes you just gotta go for it.
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:47.340]   I went for it.
[02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:48.180]   (laughing)
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:50.620]   It kind of fell flat on his face,
[02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:54.580]   but that's the thing of the conversation.
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:56.540]   - For what it's worth, I think there's like this fear
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:58.500]   where it's like, if you become like scientific
[02:00:58.500 --> 02:00:59.380]   about something, you'll figure out
[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:00.780]   that your feelings are unjustified
[02:01:00.780 --> 02:01:02.380]   and then you'll experience this horrible thing
[02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:04.780]   where like, ah shit, like I'm like afraid of this,
[02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:07.100]   but I'm sort of being forced to by my logical mind
[02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:09.040]   to like believe this thing,
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:10.860]   which I don't think this is true at all.
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:13.820]   I think like your feelings are there for a reason,
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:15.620]   like they're for a good reason.
[02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:18.180]   And like logic or like rigorous analysis
[02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:20.120]   or something should be dedicated to figuring out
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:23.920]   why it's there, not to like suppress it
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:25.720]   or tell it it shouldn't be there.
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:28.740]   - What do you think is more important to like,
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:33.740]   to just life, reason versus emotion?
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:37.560]   Like not life, to what makes us human, I guess.
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:41.000]   - My romantic narrative answer to this,
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.760]   which is like not rigorous at all is curiosity.
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:44.600]   - Curiosity.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:45.800]   - Yeah.
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:47.160]   - What is curiosity?
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:49.480]   That's such a middle ground.
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:52.920]   Curiosity is like both emotion and reason, right?
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:54.640]   So it's like this pull,
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:59.040]   'cause reason is the tool you use to figure out the puzzle.
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:02.360]   And then curiosity is the pull towards the puzzle.
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:05.800]   - Yeah, I don't like worldviews that pit like emotion
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:07.840]   and rationality as opposite each other.
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:10.840]   They feel like beautiful parts of like a cohesive whole.
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:12.440]   Like if you're doing rationality to the extent
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:13.560]   where you're like suppressing
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:14.920]   some emotional reactions you have,
[02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:15.980]   then I think you're doing it wrong.
[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:17.840]   You're like missing a big part of it.
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:19.720]   Like it should be like integrated.
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:21.840]   It should be like part of like one unified flow.
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:22.680]   Like the things that you like,
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:24.400]   if you wanna be in a romantic committed relationship
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:25.400]   for the rest of your life,
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:27.520]   then this is like beautiful and good.
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:29.640]   And the kind of like logic that you're using
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:30.480]   to make sense of the world
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:32.320]   should be fitted into that correctly.
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:33.720]   I think that's really cool.
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:35.360]   Like anytime you have sort of like an internal
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:36.560]   at odds thing with it,
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:38.480]   I think you're like using some sort of force
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:39.560]   to suppress one or the other.
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:41.120]   Like, oh, I'm not allowed to reason about this
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:42.720]   or I'm not allowed to feel about that.
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:44.040]   And that feels harsh to me.
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:46.000]   And I think curiosity is the solution.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.120]   Like if you're simply just calmly curious,
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:50.480]   oh, why do I feel like that?
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:53.080]   Let's go find out, that's so cool.
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:55.360]   Right, like you can use logic and your feelings
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:57.520]   to like discover the answer.
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:58.360]   - Do you sometimes,
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:00.600]   'cause you do this kind of technique, which is interesting.
[02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:02.500]   And I've mentioned it to others.
[02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:03.560]   You'll sometimes step away
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:05.320]   from like a third person perspective
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:07.360]   and describe the feeling you're feeling.
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:10.080]   Or like even just the situation,
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:13.000]   like you'll step out and talk about,
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.920]   wait, what is happening here?
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:16.000]   Like in the conversation itself.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.000]   - In the conversation itself.
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:17.840]   - Yeah.
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:20.440]   - First off, what is that?
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:22.040]   Do you find that to be useful?
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:23.800]   'Cause it's very interesting.
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:26.100]   It feels raw and honest.
[02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:29.300]   The danger of it seems like you escape
[02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:31.640]   the actual experience of it though.
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:33.320]   So that's the trade-off.
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.680]   You make it intellectual, right?
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:38.700]   - Is it though, intellectual to do that?
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:41.800]   I mean, maybe it is, I don't mean to.
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:44.400]   - No, maybe that's the wrong word.
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:46.600]   You can make it intellectual.
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:48.680]   You can still continue the same flavor
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:52.000]   'cause you're not fully disengaging from the conversation.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.960]   You're just creating an extra metal layer.
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:55.800]   - Yeah.
[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:57.680]   I think exploring the emotional reaction
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:03:59.200]   to what's going on in the moment.
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:00.040]   - Yeah.
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:02.760]   Yeah, in some way it's actually making it stronger.
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:06.480]   Like, or enriching it, like making it more,
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:11.200]   giving it more context, giving it deeper understanding.
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:12.680]   - I think there's like a way of going meta
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:14.280]   that is a flinch move.
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:15.880]   Like, oh, I noticed that we're doing this thing.
[02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:16.880]   I'm gonna name it.
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:18.520]   And I think the thing that I described earlier,
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:20.920]   like when the homeless guy approached me and asked,
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:22.120]   can you go home with me?
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:23.480]   And I was like, oh, are you trying
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:24.640]   to have sex with me right now?
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:25.680]   Like what I was doing was like a meta move.
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:27.240]   Like you're stepping outside and like, okay,
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:28.800]   what is the purpose of this conversation?
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:30.120]   And we explicitly identify it.
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:32.760]   And in that case, I think that is sort of like a flinch move.
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:35.880]   Like I'm not telling him my emotional response.
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:37.200]   I'm not like being fully present.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:39.000]   I'm like sort of identifying it
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.120]   as a way to subvert what's going on.
[02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:43.880]   And I absolutely think this is a possible thing.
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:45.600]   But I usually try to be aware of that in myself.
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:47.240]   And it depends on the purpose of what's going on.
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:50.760]   - That guy, 'cause that is actually like a chest move you did.
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:52.400]   You had a purpose for that chest move,
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:54.520]   but the flirtation is on.
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:59.280]   Like he could have like done a better move
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:02.480]   that would make you like curious, like, huh.
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:05.760]   Like, interesting, 'cause you had an agenda with that,
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:08.280]   but he could have changed your mind.
[02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:10.680]   Like he could have with a few words,
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:13.960]   'cause you just created extra layers, extra entry points.
[02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:15.120]   - If he'd gotten more meta,
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:16.880]   he might've been like, okay, well,
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:19.240]   now I am gonna sleep with you.
[02:05:19.240 --> 02:05:20.080]   - Exactly.
[02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:22.680]   And see, there is something, yeah,
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:24.800]   that's aids into the chemistry of the conversation
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:25.640]   when you do that meta.
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:26.560]   I really enjoy it.
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:28.760]   It's like a rare, I forget, did you and I,
[02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:33.000]   I forget who, I've had a few people do that with me,
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.920]   like just in conversation.
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:36.560]   And I feel like you were involved somehow,
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:39.760]   'cause I've met you before somewhere.
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:41.800]   I don't know if we were, or you were just in-
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:43.280]   - We've been at a couple of parties together.
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:44.640]   - Maybe it was just like a bunch of people
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:48.000]   that kind of play with the same, or like a comfortable-
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.160]   - There's circling.
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:51.360]   It's just a practice explicitly dedicated towards that.
[02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:52.200]   - What's circling?
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:53.040]   - Circling is like- - That might be the thing
[02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:53.960]   that you- - Yeah, I think,
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:56.520]   I think we know, we have some mutual circlers in our-
[02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:57.520]   - Circlers?
[02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:58.360]   - In our networks here.
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:00.000]   - Okay, what's circling?
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.080]   I don't remember what's circling.
[02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:02.400]   - I'm gonna describe it horribly,
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:03.480]   'cause it's like one of those things
[02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:05.400]   that's difficult to describe unless you experience it,
[02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:06.480]   like kind of like drugs.
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:07.920]   But it's something like you sit around,
[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:10.320]   and there's like kind of guidelines to the conversation
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:11.840]   where you talk about the present moment,
[02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:13.320]   and you're like honest about your experiences
[02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:14.160]   as much as you can be.
[02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:15.160]   And if you don't wanna be honest,
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:17.600]   then you say, "I don't wanna be honest."
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:19.320]   And it's your commitment to connection.
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:21.200]   So you're here to actually connect with the other person,
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:23.600]   understand them, and be understood.
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:25.000]   You're not supposed to project.
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.400]   So if you have an analysis about the other person,
[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:28.240]   you own it.
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:30.400]   You're like, "I'm experiencing you as this,"
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:32.840]   and then you check, "Is it true?"
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:33.680]   Or like-
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:36.000]   - Are you supposed to be almost converting it
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:39.360]   towards the thing you're thinking, like constantly?
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:40.200]   Are you supposed to say what you're thinking?
[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:42.080]   - If it feels right in the moment, you can.
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:43.520]   The thing is, it's very amorphous, right?
[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:45.600]   It's like almost like creating a magical sensation.
[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:46.520]   And I've been with some,
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:47.800]   I've seen some very good circlers,
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:49.240]   really high-skill circle,
[02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:51.080]   and I feel like I'm on drugs when that happens.
[02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:52.280]   It's very rare to see.
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:54.720]   - Does it feel honest somehow?
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:55.920]   - Yeah, very honest.
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:58.560]   Like right now in this moment,
[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:01.400]   I'm feeling like kind of like nervous energy
[02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:02.280]   because I'm talking to you,
[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:04.320]   and this is a unique situation,
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.120]   and I want you to think I'm cool.
[02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:08.080]   I want everybody listening to me to think I'm cool,
[02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:10.040]   but I'm also having some sort of delight
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:12.640]   at being able to express in this way,
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:14.640]   and some admiration for how you set up
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:17.200]   and built this thing that I can be a part of.
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:19.200]   And all of these things are sort of in my body right now
[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:21.680]   as this sort of vibrating high thing.
[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:23.120]   - I remember in the party setting,
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:24.640]   'cause I've had to talk to a few people,
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:27.760]   I felt like it was going sexual very quickly.
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:29.520]   - Okay, I don't know if you remember this,
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:31.960]   but the first time I met you, I didn't know who you were.
[02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:33.360]   I just heard, I knew I'd heard your name.
[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:34.200]   Like you just, your name,
[02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:36.240]   and I'm like, I think I've heard people discuss that.
[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:38.240]   And I was in the middle of a very sexual conversation
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:39.080]   with another woman.
[02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:39.920]   - Oh, you were?
[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:40.740]   - Yeah, I was.
[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:41.580]   And you just like turned around
[02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:42.400]   and left very shortly afterwards.
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:43.240]   And I thought it was very-
[02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:44.840]   - Oh, was I listening in on the conversation
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:45.680]   or something like that?
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:46.800]   - I think it was like, I was talking to her
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:48.080]   and you were just kind of like right there.
[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:49.240]   And so we introduced ourselves
[02:07:49.240 --> 02:07:50.680]   and then we continued on with the conversation.
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:52.280]   You were like standing there and listening.
[02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:53.960]   - Yeah, I don't think I would have left the conversation.
[02:07:53.960 --> 02:07:57.320]   So it's funny, you probably interpret it in a different way.
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:59.640]   - I interpret it as you like not wanting to listen
[02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:01.160]   to like graphic sexual stuff.
[02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:02.400]   - Was it like super graphic?
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:03.240]   - I don't know.
[02:08:03.240 --> 02:08:04.480]   I was asking her about, I was doing it.
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:06.560]   I was interviewing her about her fetish, basically.
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:09.000]   - Oh yeah, I don't think I would have walked away from that.
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:09.960]   I would have been like curious.
[02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:10.800]   Oh, interesting.
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:12.800]   'Cause I don't often see people having
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:14.480]   a deep interview about fetishes.
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:16.120]   Like I wouldn't even be, listen,
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:17.440]   I'm like Jane Goodall here.
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:20.760]   (both laughing)
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:22.800]   I'm not afraid of sexuality or something like that.
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:25.360]   I just have certain values in terms of like monogamy
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:26.200]   and so on.
[02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:27.840]   But I think sexuality is really beautiful.
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:28.680]   Yeah.
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:30.800]   I don't think,
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:33.400]   yeah, I can't imagine myself walking away
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:34.240]   from that conversation.
[02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:35.760]   - Somebody must have like called you or something.
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:37.320]   'Cause I didn't remember exactly how it worked.
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:38.720]   I just remember thinking later on.
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:40.360]   - Or maybe I thought I was intruding.
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:41.480]   - Oh, maybe.
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:43.920]   'Cause I was kind of drunk, so.
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:45.400]   - Yeah, no, I probably was very drunk too.
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:47.040]   (Dana laughing)
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:48.960]   I would like to actually have like footage
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:50.680]   of that conversation so we can actually interpret
[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:52.720]   what actually happened because it was probably,
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:56.680]   I mean, human interactions are funny like that.
[02:08:56.680 --> 02:09:00.440]   They can happen for all kinds of reasons.
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:02.680]   - Have you ever fallen in love with a client?
[02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:06.240]   - No, I mean like in tiny ways, like micro loves.
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:09.200]   - Have you ever fallen in love, love?
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:12.080]   - I mean, I don't know what it means, but probably.
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:13.800]   The thing that other people say when they say fall in love
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:16.240]   is probably something I've experienced.
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:17.740]   - What do you think they mean?
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:20.960]   What is love, Ayla?
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:21.800]   - Yeah, I know.
[02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:22.680]   - No? - It's a fantastic question.
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:24.160]   I think, so love is one of those words
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:26.040]   that refers to like a billion different concepts.
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:29.280]   And I think we maybe should just taboo the term
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:30.920]   to have a better understanding of what we're referring to.
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:33.240]   'Cause there's things like feeling intense attachment.
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:35.320]   There's something feeling like soulfully aligned.
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:36.360]   There's like sexual attraction.
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:38.680]   There's like excitement. - Are you talking to me
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:41.200]   and saying we should taboo the term love
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:42.680]   in this conversation?
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:44.280]   How dare you?
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:47.600]   No, okay.
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:50.280]   Romantic love.
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:52.760]   - To make it flourish into lots of other new definitions.
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:53.680]   - Okay, thank you.
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:55.280]   - For expanding love.
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:58.480]   - It sounds like you're censoring the most important word.
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:01.160]   This is like 1984 all over again.
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:03.960]   Okay, also on the book reading list.
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:04.920]   No, okay.
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:07.200]   Listen, no, romantic love,
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:08.760]   like a deep intimacy for somebody else,
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:13.400]   like a deep connection with a human being that is also,
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:16.000]   I mean, yeah, with polyamory it's tricky.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.760]   And your relationship with sex is also tricky.
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:22.640]   So like, what's the difference between a deep friendship
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:27.280]   and a friendship that also has a sexual component?
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:28.560]   - I remember being very confused about that
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:29.960]   when I did a lot of LSD.
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:31.520]   I was like, what?
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:33.880]   The line between romantic relationships
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:35.360]   and everything else kind of got blurred.
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:37.680]   I was like, oh, I'm just like in intimacy.
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:40.040]   And some intimacies mean that you spend your life together
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:41.440]   more and have sex, but like,
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:44.600]   the same basic thing is there.
[02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:47.640]   Like you're seeing someone for who they are.
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:49.880]   - Do you think you can be, if you're heterosexual,
[02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:52.280]   do you think you could be really deeply close
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:53.840]   with friends with a guy
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:56.480]   and not have sexual relationships with him?
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:58.120]   - I assume it's possible.
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:01.000]   Like if anything is ever possible, then probably, yeah.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.200]   - Everything is possible.
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:04.760]   Time travel is possible.
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:06.560]   Quantum mechanics makes every,
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:08.960]   traveling faster than the speed of light is possible,
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:10.280]   according to general relativity.
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:11.880]   Everything's possible.
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:13.280]   So you're saying there's a chance.
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:15.080]   Dumb and Dumber has taught me
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:17.080]   that everything is fucking possible.
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:18.240]   - Not super likely,
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:20.800]   assuming that they are like attracted to each other.
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:22.320]   - Yeah.
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:25.280]   And for somebody that has surveys and statistical analysis,
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:29.840]   we're interested in like, what's the likely thing here
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:31.000]   versus like what's possible.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.400]   - If you say possible, it's like anything's open.
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:35.160]   - Did you just avoid answering the love thing?
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:36.000]   Okay.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:36.840]   - I'd like to say about love.
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:38.200]   I just feel like to be precise.
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:39.040]   - Yeah, okay.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:42.080]   Let's be precisely and precise and continue.
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:43.560]   - Oops, sorry, that's my phone.
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:50.120]   - This feels like a passive aggressive suggestion
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:51.480]   that we shouldn't talk about love anymore,
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:52.320]   but we shall continue.
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:54.080]   - No, we should absolutely talk about love.
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:56.000]   It's just the term is very confusing.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.800]   'Cause it's like, some people say the word love
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:11:59.720]   and the thing that they're thinking of is like,
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:01.960]   oh, the butterfly is like the sparkle thing
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:04.200]   that I get in my stomach when I think about my loved one.
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:06.000]   But I study relationships over time.
[02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.960]   I just really, like I did a survey about it
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:11.040]   and that sparkle goes away within like two to four years.
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:13.240]   But people still report loving their partner after that.
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:15.040]   So I'm like, okay, like when you say the word love,
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:17.200]   like what the fuck are we talking about?
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:18.040]   - Yeah.
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:18.880]   - I just wanna get on the same page.
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:19.700]   - Okay.
[02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:22.720]   So what are the different, so the butterflies,
[02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:25.080]   boy, I'd like to push back on two to four years
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:25.920]   on the butterflies, but okay.
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:28.680]   - I mean, statistically, not everybody.
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:31.800]   - Butterflies don't give a fuck about statistics.
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:35.240]   You ever heard of the flap of a butterfly wing
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:37.500]   causing like nuclear war?
[02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:40.800]   How do you describe that with your statistics?
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:46.600]   Okay, so butterflies, that's the basic infatuation,
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:49.760]   the chemistry of the initial interactions, sure.
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:51.320]   But a deep, meaningful connection,
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:56.320]   like that feels like sexuality is a component of that.
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:01.000]   Like the kind of intimacy that's only possible
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.480]   when you're also sexual with another human being.
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:05.240]   On top of that, you have the butterfly.
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:06.960]   And on top of that, you have the friendship.
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:09.700]   And on top of that, you have like, what is that?
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:10.540]   That's a sandwich.
[02:13:10.540 --> 02:13:11.960]   - That's the love sandwich.
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:12.800]   - The love sandwich.
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:14.040]   - Okay, I'm down to call it a love sandwich.
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:17.680]   - Okay, we'll just call it sandwich, L-S.
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:22.180]   Okay, what role does that play in the human condition?
[02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:25.080]   - He asked about the human condition.
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:26.760]   It's an interesting phrase.
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:27.600]   - Yeah.
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:29.120]   - I'm like, this is like not a phrase
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:31.240]   that's common in my own thinking.
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:34.920]   - Sure, human condition is a good summary.
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:37.240]   What do you think?
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:39.280]   What do you feel when I say human condition?
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:41.760]   - I think I ask very different kinds of questions than you.
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:42.880]   - Sure, yeah.
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:43.720]   - Which is interesting.
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:44.560]   I've been trying to like figure out
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:46.280]   what kind of brain that you have
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:49.080]   is like creating like this category of question.
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:49.920]   Which is why I was like saying,
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:51.760]   there's something about poetic narrative in there.
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:55.200]   Because it's very like aesthetic.
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:56.960]   I think you've asked much more aesthetic questions
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:57.840]   than I do.
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:13:59.800]   - I don't even know what the word aesthetic means, really.
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:01.120]   - Like artistic.
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:02.200]   - Artistic.
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:04.260]   Well, I mean, I know what aesthetic means,
[02:14:04.260 --> 02:14:05.400]   but I also don't know what it means.
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:07.800]   It's kind of like the word love.
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:09.680]   Aesthetic perspective.
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:12.480]   - Yeah, well, but part of it in conversation,
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:16.160]   you don't want to ask a question that has an answer fully.
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:17.480]   Always.
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:19.160]   - Like do you have an example of a question that has-
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:22.040]   - What's the meaning of, oh, has an answer.
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:22.880]   - Yeah, like one that you think is like,
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:25.280]   ah, that's like a bad question because it has an answer.
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:28.520]   - How many sexual partners you had in the last year?
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:29.600]   - Oh my God.
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:30.760]   That's such a,
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:32.880]   okay, I feel like we just like got to some sort of crux
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:35.320]   about like the kinds of questions that we like to answer.
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:36.560]   - Sure.
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:37.720]   - 'Cause I would love that question.
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:38.560]   - Okay, right.
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:39.560]   - To ask enough people.
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:42.480]   - All right, but does that really tell the story
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:45.600]   of what you've felt over the past year?
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:48.240]   - That's true, but then I could just tell you.
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:50.880]   Okay, so by when you're saying the kinds of questions
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:52.080]   that you like, the ones that don't have an answer,
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:54.560]   by not an answer, you mean like not an answer
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:58.320]   where you can know that you're done telling it.
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:14:59.160]   Is that it?
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:00.960]   - That you can escape having to think
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:02.840]   by actually answering it.
[02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:04.360]   - I see.
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:05.520]   - Yeah.
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:10.160]   The struggle is the place where we discover something,
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:12.800]   not the destination.
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:14.880]   Contention.
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:15.960]   - It's working, it's working.
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:18.200]   Okay, so what is the role of the love sandwich
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:19.680]   in the human condition?
[02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:20.520]   - Okay, that's fine.
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:22.360]   I take that question, but it's a stupid question.
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:24.400]   - You don't have to, I'm ready to chat.
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.720]   - Do you like love?
[02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:26.560]   Do you personally like love?
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:27.840]   - Do you like love?
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:30.280]   Yeah, I mean, I think like there's a part of me
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:32.080]   that feels like I have unconditional love for all things.
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:35.040]   Like when you're talking about the glass being beautiful,
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:36.680]   I felt that.
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:38.480]   That feels like it rang something,
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:41.480]   that like I have a similar resonance in me for that.
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:44.360]   - If I were to circle right now,
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:47.640]   I feel like you're avoiding the love question,
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:50.800]   the love sandwich question.
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:52.880]   What's your own personal feeling
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:54.320]   towards loving another human being
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:56.480]   versus having sex with another human being?
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:02.400]   - Love is like one of the concepts
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:03.720]   that dissolved for me a long time ago,
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:05.560]   so I have difficulty directly answering it.
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:06.960]   But I have the experience.
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:08.160]   When you described the love sandwich,
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:10.400]   I feel like I have had that experience.
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:13.760]   I have it currently for some people also.
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:15.560]   Like I'm dating people and I have that.
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:17.240]   - So people who you date,
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:21.320]   you would describe sharing a love sandwich with them.
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:22.240]   - Yeah.
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:23.200]   - Okay.
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:27.360]   So how does, I mean, that's great to hear.
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:29.800]   So you're not, are you afraid of love?
[02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:30.920]   - No, not at all.
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:36.960]   - So can you describe to me polyamory?
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:38.360]   What is it?
[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:39.200]   What does it mean?
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:40.520]   'Cause there's like different terms.
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:42.000]   You have a nice blog post about it.
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.040]   - Yeah, I have a personal definition of it,
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:46.720]   which I readily admit is not shared by a lot of people.
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:48.240]   But to me, the definition of polyamory
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:50.240]   is simply not forbidding your partner
[02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:52.600]   from pursuing intimacy with others.
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:53.440]   - Yeah.
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:55.400]   - It doesn't mean that you have to pursue it personally.
[02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:57.040]   Like two people could be married
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.320]   and only have had sex with each other for 20 years.
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:00.480]   And as long as they're like, you know what?
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:01.880]   If you ever, you want to go have sex with somebody else,
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:02.720]   you're welcome to do that.
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:04.320]   - Well, the interesting thing you said is
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:05.640]   that doesn't mean they have to do it.
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:07.120]   They just have the freedom to do it.
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:09.360]   - Yeah, it's the freedom that matters to me.
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:15.040]   Which is, I mean, it's called the polyamory post.
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:16.680]   You have so many good blog posts.
[02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:20.120]   People should just go look at your, read your writing.
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:23.520]   'Cause it's really, really strong and often backed by data.
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:26.920]   But also just a deeply honest look at yourself
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:28.720]   and your understanding of the world.
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:33.720]   It's, yeah, it's refreshing to be there.
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:36.000]   Like with a lot of stuff I disagree with,
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.120]   but I feel like if I disagree with it,
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:40.080]   you'll be very open arguing it
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:42.160]   and kind of thinking through it.
[02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:44.360]   There's just the honesty that radiates from the whole thing.
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:46.560]   Anyway, so yeah, it's, I mean,
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:49.120]   it would be interesting to kind of explore polyamory,
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:49.960]   like how it works.
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:51.520]   What are the different versions?
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:54.400]   What is the, what does that freedom look like?
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:56.800]   What does that freedom feel like
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:59.480]   to be able to go see other people?
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:00.440]   - Depends on you.
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:02.360]   Like, do you want to go see other people?
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:04.080]   Maybe you do, maybe you don't.
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:06.660]   So usually for me, I tend to be pretty happy
[02:18:06.660 --> 02:18:08.860]   with like one or a few people.
[02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:10.980]   And then occasionally I like some novelty.
[02:18:10.980 --> 02:18:13.660]   So usually I'll go like, I host orgies sometimes.
[02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:15.000]   So I'll host an orgy
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.160]   and then I'll go have sex with people at the orgy.
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:18.560]   And then that'll be good for the novelty for a while.
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:19.760]   - Can I ask you about orgies?
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:20.600]   - Yeah.
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:22.480]   - So how many people are at an orgy?
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:24.320]   What's like a standard,
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:26.280]   we're having a Sunday picnic and it's an orgy.
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:28.280]   What's like a number of people at an orgy?
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:31.520]   - Oh, I've only recently started hosting orgies,
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:32.880]   but I have been to a lot of orgies.
[02:18:32.900 --> 02:18:36.860]   I would say like the median is maybe 15 people.
[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:38.420]   - I like how you say median versus mean.
[02:18:38.420 --> 02:18:39.300]   Okay.
[02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:40.580]   Median is 15 people.
[02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:43.460]   What's the gender distribution usually?
[02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:44.940]   - Usually about even.
[02:18:44.940 --> 02:18:46.460]   It's like ideal if you can get more women
[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:47.920]   than men in most of them.
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:50.140]   I've recently been hosting free use orgies
[02:18:50.140 --> 02:18:53.700]   or orgies where consent is assumed by default when you enter.
[02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:55.140]   And of course you can revoke it any time
[02:18:55.140 --> 02:18:56.500]   or go over a whole bunch of rules
[02:18:56.500 --> 02:18:57.400]   to make sure it's very safe.
[02:18:57.400 --> 02:18:58.940]   You like have wristbands.
[02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:00.740]   So nobody's actually doing anything they don't want to.
[02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:01.580]   - Wristbands, nice.
[02:19:01.580 --> 02:19:02.800]   - Yeah, and in those ones,
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:04.220]   you have to have more men than women.
[02:19:04.220 --> 02:19:08.540]   - I thought free use was like consensual,
[02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:09.820]   like at any time,
[02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:12.660]   but it's at any time within the constraints
[02:19:12.660 --> 02:19:14.460]   of this building or something like that.
[02:19:14.460 --> 02:19:17.340]   - Yeah, so at the orgies, it's like you, by entering,
[02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:18.660]   if you wear a wristband,
[02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:22.340]   then you are like by default opting into consent.
[02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:24.100]   So people don't have to like do a thing
[02:19:24.100 --> 02:19:26.140]   where they negotiate with you and like, be like,
[02:19:26.140 --> 02:19:27.260]   is this okay?
[02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:29.500]   It's just the default is like, you just go for it.
[02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:31.380]   And if they want you to stop, they say the safe word,
[02:19:31.380 --> 02:19:33.540]   like red, don't, and then you have to stop.
[02:19:33.540 --> 02:19:35.860]   And we do like exercise in the beginning
[02:19:35.860 --> 02:19:37.500]   of people saying red to make sure
[02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:39.140]   that everybody knows exactly what the rules are.
[02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:40.700]   - What's your favorite safe word?
[02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:41.740]   - Red. - Red.
[02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:44.100]   - When I first started doing like weird kinky shit,
[02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:45.460]   I was like, oh, let's make a safe word.
[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:47.460]   And we picked the word foliage.
[02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:49.420]   I was like, that's goofy, right?
[02:19:49.420 --> 02:19:51.540]   And then, but then eventually came a time
[02:19:51.540 --> 02:19:53.460]   where I did actually, in fact, want to say the safe word
[02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:54.300]   and I couldn't.
[02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:56.200]   I was like in agony.
[02:19:56.200 --> 02:19:57.040]   I was like crying.
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:59.620]   I'm like, I can't make myself say this stupid word
[02:19:59.620 --> 02:20:01.100]   right now.
[02:20:01.100 --> 02:20:01.940]   - Foliage.
[02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:03.820]   - So after that, I was like, red, doesn't matter.
[02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:04.660]   I don't care.
[02:20:04.660 --> 02:20:05.480]   It's not funny.
[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:06.320]   We're just going with very simple red.
[02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:07.380]   - Very practical.
[02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:09.860]   How does an orgy compare sexually
[02:20:09.860 --> 02:20:11.960]   to like a one-on-one sexual experience?
[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:17.100]   Like what, is it same ballpark
[02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:18.780]   or is it fundamentally different?
[02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:20.740]   - I mean, the experience of both orgies
[02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:23.020]   and one-on-one sex can be like really high variety.
[02:20:23.020 --> 02:20:23.860]   - There's a high variety.
[02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:25.260]   - But you kind of, it's a little bit
[02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:26.380]   like you're having sex with someone,
[02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:28.820]   but you're surrounded by really realistic VR porn
[02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:29.940]   of other people having sex.
[02:20:29.940 --> 02:20:30.780]   - Oh, okay, cool.
[02:20:30.780 --> 02:20:32.540]   - And sometimes it's like a three sums also,
[02:20:32.540 --> 02:20:34.300]   like maybe there's another person involved,
[02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:36.660]   but it's hard to like have a whole bunch of people
[02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:38.140]   on one, in one cluster.
[02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:40.060]   'Cause usually there's kind of different little clusters
[02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:41.980]   of people having their experience.
[02:20:41.980 --> 02:20:45.340]   I once was part of a 10 woman orgy.
[02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:46.940]   It was a total lesbian thing.
[02:20:46.940 --> 02:20:48.540]   And that felt like a writhing cluster.
[02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:49.420]   It was very nice.
[02:20:49.420 --> 02:20:52.220]   But typically you kind of separate out
[02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:54.480]   with like very small pods of people doing stuff.
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:56.420]   - Okay, so back to polyamory.
[02:20:56.420 --> 02:21:00.180]   So what's a good, what does it take to manage?
[02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:02.940]   Do you have a main partner if you're being polyamorous
[02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:04.280]   and you're dating multiple people?
[02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:07.180]   Is there usually a main one for you personally?
[02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:09.100]   - For me personally, kind of, yes.
[02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:11.420]   Like right now I kind of, two that aren't,
[02:21:11.420 --> 02:21:12.700]   like I see roughly around,
[02:21:12.700 --> 02:21:14.100]   for me it's kind of just descriptive.
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:16.220]   Like if I just happen to be seeing you a lot more
[02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:18.100]   and I confide in you more than you,
[02:21:18.100 --> 02:21:20.460]   like you're descriptively my primary partner.
[02:21:20.460 --> 02:21:22.860]   But I don't usually have rules to protect that.
[02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:24.120]   I'm down with rules to protect it
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:24.960]   if you're like, you're trying to build something.
[02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:26.540]   Like if I buy a house together, I'd be like, okay,
[02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:27.940]   we need to like, whatever our relationship is,
[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:28.780]   we have to do the thing,
[02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:30.420]   we're both paying the rent for the house
[02:21:30.420 --> 02:21:32.540]   or the mortgage or whatever.
[02:21:32.540 --> 02:21:33.580]   A lot of people do have primaries,
[02:21:33.580 --> 02:21:36.400]   so it's very common to have like prescriptive,
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:37.420]   like I'm gonna get married to you
[02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:38.740]   and you're not allowed to like have anal sex
[02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:40.740]   with anybody else, that sort of thing.
[02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:42.060]   - What about like the transparency
[02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:43.540]   and the communication that you have to do?
[02:21:43.540 --> 02:21:45.780]   Do you usually try to be super honest about it?
[02:21:45.780 --> 02:21:46.620]   - Extremely, yeah.
[02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:48.260]   I mean, I've learned over time that like,
[02:21:48.260 --> 02:21:50.100]   even if it seems like a very small thing,
[02:21:50.100 --> 02:21:51.520]   you talk about the small thing.
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:52.980]   'Cause often I would just sort of have
[02:21:52.980 --> 02:21:54.140]   like a small twitch in myself,
[02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:55.340]   like I don't know if I like that.
[02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.180]   But I'd be like, okay, this is really minor,
[02:21:57.180 --> 02:21:58.260]   it's probably nothing.
[02:21:58.260 --> 02:22:00.500]   And if I talk about it, it's gonna make it into a thing.
[02:22:00.500 --> 02:22:02.260]   And I just don't wanna make it into a thing, you know?
[02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:04.340]   And I've come to realize
[02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:05.780]   that it's worth making it into a thing.
[02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:07.060]   Because I can't predict at the time
[02:22:07.060 --> 02:22:08.980]   if like the small feeling I have is going to grow.
[02:22:08.980 --> 02:22:09.940]   And then when I grow it,
[02:22:09.940 --> 02:22:13.020]   now it's like much more difficult to deal with.
[02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:14.740]   So now it's like any little bit of jealousy
[02:22:14.740 --> 02:22:15.980]   I have, I immediately communicate it.
[02:22:15.980 --> 02:22:18.020]   I'm like, ah, I'm a little jealous of you right now.
[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:19.460]   I don't hold that in at all.
[02:22:19.460 --> 02:22:21.060]   I used to be kind of like,
[02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:22.420]   back when I first started being poly,
[02:22:22.420 --> 02:22:24.520]   I used to try to pretend that I was not a jealous person
[02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:26.380]   and that backfired quite a lot.
[02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:27.220]   - That's really interesting.
[02:22:27.220 --> 02:22:28.140]   So you do still feel jealousy?
[02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:29.140]   - Oh yeah, definitely.
[02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:32.100]   - And it's also interesting that you kind of recommend
[02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:33.500]   when there's a little bit of jealousy
[02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:35.500]   to bring that to the surface.
[02:22:35.500 --> 02:22:37.420]   - Yeah, just like excessively communicate.
[02:22:37.420 --> 02:22:39.420]   Even if it feels stupid.
[02:22:39.420 --> 02:22:41.420]   Like this is, I feel like a cliche.
[02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:43.980]   I feel like a stupid therapist training video.
[02:22:43.980 --> 02:22:45.580]   Like I just feel ridiculous sometimes
[02:22:45.580 --> 02:22:46.660]   when I'm saying the things.
[02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:48.260]   But I've learned over time,
[02:22:48.260 --> 02:22:49.660]   it's just important to just say the things.
[02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:51.900]   - 'Cause like, you know, the traditional view of jealousy
[02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:53.020]   is exactly like you said.
[02:22:53.020 --> 02:22:54.460]   If you bring it up to the surface,
[02:22:54.460 --> 02:22:57.740]   like it's gonna sound like you're overreacting to everything.
[02:22:58.620 --> 02:23:00.380]   But you're saying like, still do it.
[02:23:00.380 --> 02:23:01.900]   'Cause you're basically,
[02:23:01.900 --> 02:23:05.780]   your brain blows stuff out of proportion.
[02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:07.780]   - Yeah, and it's good to like be going through it
[02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:08.900]   with a partner.
[02:23:08.900 --> 02:23:10.240]   Like I have a partner right now
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:11.540]   who's like dating this other girl
[02:23:11.540 --> 02:23:12.620]   and he like really likes her
[02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:14.100]   and he like went traveling with her and stuff.
[02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:15.740]   And I was like, I feel jealous about it.
[02:23:15.740 --> 02:23:16.820]   And I have to tell him that
[02:23:16.820 --> 02:23:18.700]   and that way he can be with me in it.
[02:23:18.700 --> 02:23:21.580]   He like holds me when I'm feeling jealous.
[02:23:21.580 --> 02:23:23.900]   And it's like a bonding experience, you know?
[02:23:23.900 --> 02:23:26.140]   But it's important for me that like he's able to handle it.
[02:23:26.140 --> 02:23:28.460]   Like I try not to date people who really freak out
[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:29.820]   when I have negative emotions
[02:23:29.820 --> 02:23:31.220]   because I wanna be able to express
[02:23:31.220 --> 02:23:33.180]   that I'm upset by something they're doing
[02:23:33.180 --> 02:23:35.300]   without it being taken as a demand
[02:23:35.300 --> 02:23:36.420]   that they change their behavior.
[02:23:36.420 --> 02:23:39.620]   - Right, so he has to be able to skillfully handle
[02:23:39.620 --> 02:23:40.460]   that interaction.
[02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:41.980]   - He has to be like, cool, all right, you're jealous.
[02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:43.100]   Like I'm not gonna freak out about it.
[02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:44.020]   I'm not gonna change my behavior.
[02:23:44.020 --> 02:23:45.700]   I'm just gonna be with you in that.
[02:23:45.700 --> 02:23:47.260]   We're gonna sit in it together.
[02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:50.100]   - I mean, is some of that just insecurity
[02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:51.740]   that he should also just comfort,
[02:23:51.740 --> 02:23:54.380]   like basically alleviate your insecurity,
[02:23:54.380 --> 02:23:57.420]   bring you back to like a rational objective evaluation?
[02:23:57.420 --> 02:23:58.500]   - My relationships, I love it
[02:23:58.500 --> 02:23:59.860]   when people do not reassure me.
[02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:02.580]   I like not being comforted quite a lot.
[02:24:02.580 --> 02:24:04.260]   And so usually the people I date don't.
[02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:05.580]   I'm very gravitating.
[02:24:05.580 --> 02:24:06.620]   Like it's one of the things people do
[02:24:06.620 --> 02:24:07.580]   to make me fall in love with them
[02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:09.540]   is if I say something really like terrible
[02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:10.380]   and they're just like,
[02:24:10.380 --> 02:24:12.220]   "Do not give me any comfort whatsoever."
[02:24:12.220 --> 02:24:15.020]   Like that's where my heart gets captured.
[02:24:15.020 --> 02:24:17.020]   So I typically am in relationships where I'm like,
[02:24:17.020 --> 02:24:18.060]   hi man, I'm so jealous.
[02:24:18.060 --> 02:24:20.340]   And they just like do not reassure me at all.
[02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:22.300]   And that's good 'cause it doesn't give me an out.
[02:24:22.300 --> 02:24:24.500]   Like I have to deal with it myself.
[02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:25.980]   Like maybe it is true
[02:24:25.980 --> 02:24:27.340]   that the other woman is better than me.
[02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:29.540]   Like maybe that is an actual possible reality.
[02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:31.620]   And I don't wanna be dealing with my life
[02:24:31.620 --> 02:24:32.900]   in a way where I'm like pretending
[02:24:32.900 --> 02:24:35.300]   like I'm only okay when that reality is not true.
[02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:38.060]   - Would you like them to say that,
[02:24:38.060 --> 02:24:39.660]   that the other woman is better than you?
[02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:41.860]   - Or that they prefer. - If they feel that?
[02:24:41.860 --> 02:24:44.540]   - Yeah, I mean, they should say it according to themselves.
[02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:46.820]   Like, oh, I prefer, like I have a better time with her
[02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:49.100]   than I have with you, then I would wanna know that, yeah.
[02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:51.500]   - And even though that might be painful to hear.
[02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:52.340]   - Yes.
[02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:57.060]   That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.
[02:24:57.060 --> 02:24:59.700]   - That which can be destroyed by the truth.
[02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:01.900]   What is that, that your ego or something like that?
[02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:04.260]   - Yeah, my ego. (laughs)
[02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:05.900]   - So your ego just generally grows
[02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:07.260]   and you like the destruction of it.
[02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:08.100]   - Yeah, it's like really active.
[02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:09.700]   - So the process of truth.
[02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:10.820]   - It's not like a fun experience.
[02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:12.220]   Like I've had like guys be like,
[02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:13.820]   well, you're not as pretty as I'd like.
[02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:17.660]   I'm just like, oh, you know, stabbed to the heart.
[02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:19.740]   - But then also like give me your number after.
[02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:20.580]   - Yeah.
[02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:23.700]   (laughs)
[02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:25.940]   - Man, that's kind of beautiful.
[02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:29.260]   What do you think of monogamous relationships?
[02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:32.780]   Like philosophically, can you maybe steal a man
[02:25:32.780 --> 02:25:35.100]   or make the case for monogamous relationships?
[02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:37.860]   Can you understand the pros and cons
[02:25:37.860 --> 02:25:38.980]   of monogamous relationships?
[02:25:38.980 --> 02:25:40.380]   - Yeah, I mean, it depends on how you,
[02:25:40.380 --> 02:25:43.220]   if you're like, hey, you can do whatever you want,
[02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:44.540]   but you and I are gonna spend the rest,
[02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:46.660]   like we just, you're 80 years old and like,
[02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:48.900]   oh, we spent 60 years in a marriage together.
[02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:49.980]   We've never had sex with anybody else.
[02:25:49.980 --> 02:25:51.020]   I think that's like awesome.
[02:25:51.020 --> 02:25:52.980]   If that's what you want, that's great.
[02:25:52.980 --> 02:25:54.260]   I have like a little bit more problems
[02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:56.900]   with people doing that while also forcing their partner
[02:25:56.900 --> 02:25:59.540]   not to misbehave if they want to.
[02:25:59.540 --> 02:26:01.740]   Like if you're like, oh, we only made it this far
[02:26:01.740 --> 02:26:03.660]   in a monogamous relationship because I forced my partner
[02:26:03.660 --> 02:26:06.420]   not to pursue an intimacy that she wanted to.
[02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:08.060]   Then I feel like a little like more like,
[02:26:08.060 --> 02:26:09.700]   ah, I don't know if that's great.
[02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:12.620]   - How do you know if it's a real want for an intimacy?
[02:26:12.620 --> 02:26:15.540]   Like checking out a attractive person
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:17.340]   while being inside a monogamous relationship.
[02:26:17.340 --> 02:26:18.180]   Yeah, how do you score that?
[02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:21.380]   Is that bad that the person cannot pursue those feelings?
[02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:24.220]   - I mean, it depends if they want to.
[02:26:24.220 --> 02:26:25.460]   Like I often find people attractive
[02:26:25.460 --> 02:26:26.760]   if I don't want to pursue.
[02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:31.140]   I'm also okay with people entering into agreements.
[02:26:31.140 --> 02:26:33.420]   Like if you and I want to agree,
[02:26:33.420 --> 02:26:34.580]   like I'm only going to enter this
[02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:36.940]   'cause I'm gonna be so hurt if you pursue somebody else.
[02:26:36.940 --> 02:26:38.580]   So I'm not gonna pursue anybody else.
[02:26:38.580 --> 02:26:39.860]   That seems fine to me.
[02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:40.700]   But I also extend that.
[02:26:40.700 --> 02:26:41.780]   Like if somebody is like,
[02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:43.260]   I don't want you to have any friends,
[02:26:43.260 --> 02:26:44.980]   I'm gonna feel really insecure if you,
[02:26:44.980 --> 02:26:47.020]   and like, okay, like if you want to enter that agreement,
[02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:47.860]   like I feel the same way.
[02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:49.180]   Like I think you should have the right to do it
[02:26:49.180 --> 02:26:50.420]   if this is what you want.
[02:26:50.420 --> 02:26:51.260]   But I also kind of,
[02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:53.060]   I feel like a little weird about restricting your partner
[02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:54.460]   from doing things, you know?
[02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:55.860]   - Oh, but I guess if you're honest about it
[02:26:55.860 --> 02:26:57.460]   and you just put it on the table,
[02:26:57.460 --> 02:27:00.740]   I don't want you to have any friends.
[02:27:00.740 --> 02:27:02.220]   I want you to sit in a box.
[02:27:02.220 --> 02:27:04.660]   - Yeah, I think a lot-
[02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:06.260]   - I guess if you're like really on the,
[02:27:06.260 --> 02:27:07.820]   but then there's like,
[02:27:07.820 --> 02:27:10.060]   there's a power dynamic
[02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:14.260]   that like you can be quite influential in a relationship
[02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:16.500]   and convincing your partner.
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:19.500]   And it sure sounds like you're honestly agreeing to a thing,
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:20.940]   but you're not really agreeing.
[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:22.580]   That's the, I mean,
[02:27:22.580 --> 02:27:24.660]   part of that is the beauty of relationships, right?
[02:27:24.660 --> 02:27:29.020]   Like it's messy, it can be messy.
[02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:30.740]   It's hard to know what you really want, right?
[02:27:30.740 --> 02:27:32.580]   - I think that's mainly my complaint with monogamy.
[02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:35.460]   Like I'm down with like conscious monogamy.
[02:27:35.460 --> 02:27:37.500]   But I think so many relationships
[02:27:37.500 --> 02:27:39.140]   are like monogamous by default.
[02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:41.060]   Like people, it's not actually right for them,
[02:27:41.060 --> 02:27:41.900]   but they just get into it
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:44.300]   because culture just doesn't give them another option.
[02:27:44.300 --> 02:27:46.020]   - And they don't even ask themselves the question,
[02:27:46.020 --> 02:27:46.860]   is this right for me?
[02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:48.980]   - Right, which like I'm a weird ass person
[02:27:48.980 --> 02:27:50.180]   who thinks a lot of weird shit,
[02:27:50.180 --> 02:27:52.540]   but I didn't even think about polyamorous an option
[02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:54.740]   before I had heard that it existed.
[02:27:54.740 --> 02:27:57.620]   And I was only when I first met my first polyamorous couple
[02:27:57.620 --> 02:27:59.300]   and I was like, oh, that's what I am.
[02:27:59.300 --> 02:28:01.060]   That's clearly the thing that I am.
[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:04.140]   - Yeah, it's funny 'cause to me monogamy,
[02:28:04.140 --> 02:28:08.780]   it's not, it doesn't make sense for it to be a default.
[02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:11.300]   Like to me, monogamy goes against human nature.
[02:28:11.300 --> 02:28:14.780]   In some sense, like romance is a fuck you
[02:28:14.780 --> 02:28:16.780]   to the way the world works.
[02:28:16.780 --> 02:28:17.620]   - Really?
[02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:20.020]   - Yeah, like it's a, like Romeo and Juliet romance,
[02:28:20.020 --> 02:28:23.700]   like traditional description of what romance looks like
[02:28:23.700 --> 02:28:26.460]   versus like, sure, there's like a million variations of that.
[02:28:26.460 --> 02:28:29.380]   But in my head, like this partnership
[02:28:29.380 --> 02:28:34.380]   that's for a long time together is a kind of,
[02:28:34.380 --> 02:28:37.540]   you know, like, I don't know, like true romance.
[02:28:37.540 --> 02:28:38.380]   You know that movie?
[02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:39.380]   It's a really fucking good movie.
[02:28:39.380 --> 02:28:40.220]   - I haven't seen it, no.
[02:28:40.220 --> 02:28:41.460]   - Okay, there's just like,
[02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:46.920]   you're together against the world.
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:52.380]   That's the, I mean, that's what close friendship feels like.
[02:28:52.380 --> 02:28:53.620]   It's like ride or die.
[02:28:53.620 --> 02:28:54.460]   - Yeah.
[02:28:54.460 --> 02:28:55.300]   - Like that.
[02:28:55.300 --> 02:28:57.460]   I guess it doesn't, it can be,
[02:28:57.460 --> 02:28:58.660]   it could span across multiple,
[02:28:58.660 --> 02:29:00.980]   you can have multiple partners in that way.
[02:29:00.980 --> 02:29:01.820]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:29:01.820 --> 02:29:03.780]   - But I just don't see monogamy as like,
[02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:06.300]   definitely not a default.
[02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:08.060]   I would actually, like honestly,
[02:29:08.060 --> 02:29:11.500]   would probably see polyamory as a more natural default.
[02:29:12.540 --> 02:29:13.500]   - Yeah, I mean, I guess it depends
[02:29:13.500 --> 02:29:14.540]   on what you mean by default.
[02:29:14.540 --> 02:29:17.740]   Like most of human history has been sort of a weird mix.
[02:29:17.740 --> 02:29:19.740]   Like you get polygamy and monogamy
[02:29:19.740 --> 02:29:21.180]   are kind of the main arrangements.
[02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:22.020]   - Sure.
[02:29:22.020 --> 02:29:23.500]   But I mean, just like human nature.
[02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:25.420]   - Yeah, people are attracted to other people
[02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:28.620]   and they wanna, especially in longer term relationships.
[02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:30.500]   I tracked, in my relationship survey,
[02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:32.320]   I tracked the amount of cheating over time
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:33.160]   in a relationship.
[02:29:33.160 --> 02:29:34.420]   Like how long have you been in this relationship
[02:29:34.420 --> 02:29:35.580]   and have you cheated?
[02:29:35.580 --> 02:29:37.900]   - What's the results of that?
[02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:39.700]   - Men cheat a lot.
[02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:42.460]   Women too, but men cheat about 30% more than women do.
[02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:44.500]   I also asked men and women to predict
[02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:46.500]   if they think their partner has cheated.
[02:29:46.500 --> 02:29:48.100]   And people's predictions were about the same.
[02:29:48.100 --> 02:29:51.780]   So people roughly predicted that their male or female
[02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:54.980]   like spouse hadn't cheated about the same rate,
[02:29:54.980 --> 02:29:56.860]   but men cheated much more than women.
[02:29:56.860 --> 02:29:59.540]   - So who was more correct in their prediction though?
[02:29:59.540 --> 02:30:01.300]   - So men were more correct in their prediction
[02:30:01.300 --> 02:30:02.180]   predicting women.
[02:30:02.180 --> 02:30:04.540]   And women were more off.
[02:30:04.540 --> 02:30:07.700]   Women thought men cheated much less than they actually did.
[02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:09.900]   And, but both of them were off,
[02:30:09.900 --> 02:30:12.660]   but like the male gap was significantly more.
[02:30:12.660 --> 02:30:13.700]   So yeah, I mean, you're right.
[02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:15.020]   When you say monogamy is not default,
[02:30:15.020 --> 02:30:17.660]   like I think you're like really getting at something.
[02:30:17.660 --> 02:30:18.700]   Like human beings are just,
[02:30:18.700 --> 02:30:20.100]   especially in long-term relationships,
[02:30:20.100 --> 02:30:23.540]   it's difficult to only want one person.
[02:30:23.540 --> 02:30:25.300]   But to be fair, I think monogamy and commitment
[02:30:25.300 --> 02:30:26.140]   are very different.
[02:30:26.140 --> 02:30:27.140]   I think you'd be incredibly,
[02:30:27.140 --> 02:30:29.180]   I haven't known so many very long-term,
[02:30:29.180 --> 02:30:31.700]   super committed poly couples that live lives
[02:30:31.700 --> 02:30:32.540]   that look very similar
[02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:34.500]   to the very romantic monogamous couples.
[02:30:34.500 --> 02:30:37.020]   Like children, houses, like 20 years.
[02:30:37.900 --> 02:30:39.940]   And that works great for them.
[02:30:39.940 --> 02:30:42.580]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:47.100]   I mean, there's so much to like open your mind to
[02:30:47.100 --> 02:30:50.660]   in these kinds of conversations, these kinds of ideas.
[02:30:50.660 --> 02:30:54.220]   But I also like realize like some of the cake is baked.
[02:30:54.220 --> 02:30:55.620]   Like I have some assumptions
[02:30:55.620 --> 02:30:57.020]   that are hard to break through.
[02:30:57.020 --> 02:30:57.860]   - Like what?
[02:30:57.860 --> 02:30:58.700]   - For myself.
[02:30:58.700 --> 02:31:01.060]   Like it's difficult for me to imagine
[02:31:01.060 --> 02:31:03.500]   a polyamorous relationship for me that would work.
[02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:05.800]   But I don't have enough data.
[02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:08.580]   I don't have a, like I have very little.
[02:31:08.580 --> 02:31:09.780]   But like at this point,
[02:31:09.780 --> 02:31:16.060]   it's like I haven't eaten pizza in like 20 years
[02:31:16.060 --> 02:31:18.980]   'cause I know I just don't,
[02:31:18.980 --> 02:31:19.820]   there's a bunch of stuff.
[02:31:19.820 --> 02:31:23.840]   I just eat low carb 'cause it makes me feel good.
[02:31:23.840 --> 02:31:26.100]   But there's so many foods I haven't explored.
[02:31:26.100 --> 02:31:29.800]   It's just like, well, I know what I love.
[02:31:29.800 --> 02:31:32.500]   So you explore every once in a while.
[02:31:32.500 --> 02:31:35.080]   Yeah, and you kind of figure that out.
[02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:36.980]   But at the same time, you're humbled by like,
[02:31:36.980 --> 02:31:38.660]   even talking to you or looking at your data.
[02:31:38.660 --> 02:31:41.960]   Like sexuality is a fascinating topic
[02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:44.860]   because it seems that we're very,
[02:31:44.860 --> 02:31:47.820]   like we were talking about, very afraid of this topic.
[02:31:47.820 --> 02:31:50.260]   Like to be really honest with ourselves about it.
[02:31:50.260 --> 02:31:54.160]   The whole like academic research is afraid of it,
[02:31:54.160 --> 02:31:57.180]   but it's so core to who we are as human beings.
[02:31:57.180 --> 02:31:58.560]   I gotta ask you about this.
[02:31:58.560 --> 02:32:00.520]   I can't believe it took this long to get there.
[02:32:00.520 --> 02:32:04.800]   But one of your many fascinating surveys is on fetishes.
[02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:08.320]   You wrote a blog post about it,
[02:32:08.320 --> 02:32:11.920]   probably several 'cause it's like a huge data set.
[02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:13.800]   - Still in progress, yeah.
[02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:16.200]   - So the one I'm referring to is on popularity
[02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:20.120]   and tabooness of various fetishes.
[02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:21.700]   So what are some interesting takeaways?
[02:32:21.700 --> 02:32:24.120]   I gotta pull up this graph 'cause it's freaking epic.
[02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:27.040]   - Yes, this is a big graph and it has tabooness
[02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:31.980]   as one axis and popularity as the other.
[02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:33.400]   - Okay, for people who are just listening,
[02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:36.220]   on the X-axis is tabooness.
[02:32:36.220 --> 02:32:37.220]   - Yeah.
[02:32:37.220 --> 02:32:41.280]   - Asked to rate how taboo society viewed sexual interest.
[02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:43.880]   And on the Y-axis is percent of people
[02:32:43.880 --> 02:32:46.800]   reporting interest, log scale.
[02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:49.400]   Oh boy, all right.
[02:32:49.400 --> 02:32:53.160]   So just some examples on the low tabooness
[02:32:53.160 --> 02:32:54.320]   and high popularity.
[02:32:54.320 --> 02:32:55.760]   There's a correlation here.
[02:32:55.760 --> 02:32:57.400]   I think you said it's 0.69.
[02:32:57.400 --> 02:32:58.240]   - Yeah.
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:00.280]   - It's just not, it's just hilarious.
[02:33:00.280 --> 02:33:01.280]   Is it still 0.69?
[02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:02.640]   Are you tracking that?
[02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:05.560]   - I haven't looked since I did this, yeah.
[02:33:05.560 --> 02:33:08.160]   - So like the less taboo stuff is more likely to be popular
[02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:10.920]   and the more taboo stuff is less likely to be popular.
[02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:14.660]   And on the missionary position,
[02:33:14.660 --> 02:33:20.840]   fingering vagina, blowjobs, light spanking, cuddling.
[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:23.640]   Cuddling is more taboo than missionary?
[02:33:23.640 --> 02:33:25.000]   - I think people are conceiving,
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:26.440]   if you're like, I'm really sexually aroused
[02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:27.800]   by cuddling specifically.
[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:28.640]   - Sure.
[02:33:28.640 --> 02:33:29.460]   - Then you're like, that's a little more weird
[02:33:29.460 --> 02:33:30.840]   than getting specifically aroused by blowjobs.
[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:32.440]   You expect people to be aroused by blowjobs.
[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:34.280]   - So this was like getting at like,
[02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:36.280]   as a fetish versus like an activity.
[02:33:36.280 --> 02:33:39.040]   - Yeah, as a specific, as a like a concrete sexual interest.
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:41.600]   Like I am specifically interested in this thing, yeah.
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:44.920]   - And so those are thighs and lips, different body parts,
[02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:47.560]   jaw lines, and then some of it is color
[02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:52.440]   based on more female preference versus male preference.
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:57.400]   Like jaw lines is more female preference.
[02:33:57.400 --> 02:33:59.680]   Being submissive is more female preference,
[02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:04.240]   light bondage, more female.
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:05.280]   There's a lot of interesting ones.
[02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:06.440]   There's so much, okay.
[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:08.480]   But then on the far side of that,
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:09.920]   I mean, it gets pretty dark.
[02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:14.900]   But even all along the way, like extreme bondage,
[02:34:14.900 --> 02:34:19.900]   being at 50 tabooness, pegging, pain, giving pain,
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:25.240]   sexual frustration, I suppose, as a kink.
[02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:28.800]   And there's so many interesting ones, like to me,
[02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:31.840]   like just that I haven't even like considered.
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:34.680]   - Yeah, I had to do so much research into fetishes
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:37.000]   to compile the list.
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.200]   - Are there some surprising like options to you
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:41.520]   that you're like, oh, okay, this is like a fetish.
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:43.400]   - Yeah, well, more confusing was like
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:45.160]   what the fetishes are about.
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:46.840]   'Cause like I didn't wanna overlap fetishes,
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:48.600]   so I had to kind of look into them.
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:51.760]   And I'm like, there's like such interesting manifestations
[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:52.600]   of core drives.
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:54.240]   Like if you're really aroused by disgust,
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:56.360]   like maybe you're very into rolling around in dirt,
[02:34:56.360 --> 02:34:58.680]   but you're not into rolling around with ice cream.
[02:34:58.680 --> 02:34:59.680]   So I'm like, okay, I have to make those
[02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:00.880]   into two separate fetishes, you know?
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:04.520]   - Sure, and like I'm seeing like at the far end,
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:12.040]   rodents, like different types of incest,
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:15.880]   branding, so there's like pain.
[02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:18.240]   - And then-- - Like wound fucking.
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:22.740]   - Sex with animals, I guess, dogs, horses.
[02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:32.040]   Receiving oral sex from an animal is high taboo-ness
[02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:33.800]   and pretty high popularity.
[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:35.140]   - Surprisingly high popularity.
[02:35:35.140 --> 02:35:36.380]   I was really shocked by that one.
[02:35:36.380 --> 02:35:37.760]   I wouldn't triple check that number
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:39.040]   'cause I'm like, no way,
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:41.720]   this is about to people are reporting interest.
[02:35:41.720 --> 02:35:43.480]   - Do you know which animal?
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:45.520]   Is there-- - No, I didn't specify.
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:47.040]   I asked like which animals are erotic
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:49.120]   and then I separately asked like how erotic is it
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:52.380]   to receive oral sex from your preferred animal?
[02:35:52.380 --> 02:35:54.640]   - This is so fascinating.
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:59.640]   So I would, can we just talk about the methodology of this?
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:09.480]   This feels like deeply honest map of humanity
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:11.920]   in a way we don't usually map humanity.
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:12.740]   - Yeah.
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:17.600]   'Cause it's so, your fetishes are so meaningful
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:19.480]   to each individual person.
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:21.360]   - Yeah, that's what I love about this work.
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:24.600]   It's like nobody cares about someone's fetishes.
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:25.920]   You never get to express them
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:27.640]   and if you have a more unusual fetish,
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:29.040]   people usually judge you.
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:31.780]   So it's like this tiny little pocket of this shame thing
[02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:34.800]   but it's so cool to me that human brains
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:37.600]   could be oriented in such a way, like wound fucking.
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:40.680]   Like somebody finds that so erotic and that's so cool.
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:43.640]   - Yeah, and then they probably,
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:46.520]   and it should be explored like how did that come to be?
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:49.160]   You mentioned that we like to construct narratives
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:50.880]   that somehow was grounded in childhood
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:52.280]   but maybe it's genetic.
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:53.560]   Maybe it has to do with,
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:55.600]   maybe you can actually form and unform
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:57.320]   that fetish very quickly.
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:36:58.880]   I don't know.
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:00.560]   - This is one of the things that I'm researching.
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:02.600]   So in the big survey that I'm doing,
[02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:04.280]   I asked so many questions about childhood.
[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:06.800]   All the ones that I think like we have common theories
[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:08.280]   about like oh, are you abused?
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:10.720]   Is it yelled at by a man or a woman?
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:11.560]   Stuff like that.
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:13.080]   Like, are you really sexually repressive?
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:14.120]   You know, is it gender roles
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:16.240]   where you've expected to conform?
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:17.160]   A whole bunch of stuff.
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:18.040]   And then I asked, you know,
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:20.280]   obviously about like a massive amount of fetishes.
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:22.720]   And my sample size right now is 500,000 people.
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:24.520]   - 500,000 people. - Yeah, it's massive.
[02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:26.360]   And I have to stay for all of it.
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:29.560]   And the result looks like this not really correlated.
[02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:31.320]   Nothing that I asked about in childhood,
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:34.720]   nothing correlates with fetish preference later in life.
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:36.200]   It does correlate with onset.
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:37.720]   Lots of things that happen in childhood
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:41.160]   can change like the age at which it triggers.
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:42.640]   - You have so many fascinating blog posts.
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:47.440]   You had a blog post, I think, on the age of fetish onset.
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:48.640]   - Yeah.
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:53.640]   - And like you really nicely organized it by age,
[02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:58.280]   like reproduction as a fetish, I guess pregnancy.
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:37:59.360]   - Yeah.
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:02.300]   - At age of 17, about 16.9.
[02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:07.400]   Toys and like anal beads is 15.5.
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:09.000]   - Yeah, one of the interesting things I found,
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:10.880]   I mean, this data set is so huge,
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:12.000]   it's taking me a long time to go through it.
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:13.840]   So this is like snippets from what I remember
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:14.880]   when I was glancing through the data.
[02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:16.280]   So this part is not rigorous,
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:20.080]   but I seem to get the impression that if you are,
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:21.920]   if a fetish occurs for you earlier,
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:23.000]   like if you have much earlier onset,
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:24.000]   you're more likely to report
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:25.980]   being extremely interested into it.
[02:38:25.980 --> 02:38:27.680]   So later onset means you're gonna be like
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:30.280]   less into the fetish, but if it hits earlier,
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:31.640]   it's like-- - But I wonder if it passes,
[02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:34.320]   like is there like-- - Yeah, I didn't measure
[02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:36.560]   old fetishes at all.
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:38.600]   Like no longer, right?
[02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:41.560]   You used to, but it's no longer there, interesting.
[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:43.260]   - One interesting thing that I don't understand
[02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:47.420]   is that non-cis people seem to have more correlation
[02:38:47.420 --> 02:38:49.600]   between childhood experiences and fetishes.
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:51.080]   So I was saying that there's no correlation
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:52.520]   between childhood experiences and fetishes.
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:54.040]   This holds for cis people.
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:55.720]   But trans people, especially trans men,
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:38:57.000]   there's a correlation.
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:58.720]   It doesn't mean they have absolutely higher rates
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:00.440]   of abuse or fetishes or anything,
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:02.360]   but I'm just saying that like for them,
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:04.320]   there does actually seem to be some sort of connection
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:05.960]   between childhood experiences and sexuality
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:06.800]   later in life.
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:08.680]   And I don't understand why this applies to one group
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:09.520]   but not the other.
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:10.640]   I don't have a good theory for that.
[02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:12.560]   - So usually you try, like when you see something like that,
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:15.640]   you'll try to construct a theory and see if you can find,
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:18.440]   like you keep that theory in mind,
[02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:20.480]   like a hypothesis of why it would be,
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:23.800]   and then you ask further questions to try to elaborate.
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:26.440]   So can you maybe talk about the methodology
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:27.880]   of how you got the 500,000?
[02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:31.720]   Like what, like how did this come to be?
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:34.280]   - This might, yeah, this is, I might go into way too much
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:36.520]   detail about this 'cause I thought about this so much.
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:38.240]   'Cause I'm like, the question is how do you get
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:40.360]   a lot of people to take a big survey?
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:42.960]   The longer the survey is, the lower the response rate.
[02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:45.480]   And I really wanted to do one big comprehensive survey
[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:47.320]   so I could like check a whole bunch of correlations
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:50.320]   within it 'cause it's more annoying
[02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:53.000]   and it's harder to get a lot of people to retake
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.120]   similar surveys to each other at a time.
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:56.280]   So I'm like, okay, I need to convince
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:57.720]   a very large number of people to take
[02:39:57.720 --> 02:39:58.960]   a lot of these questions.
[02:39:58.960 --> 02:40:01.080]   And even building the questions, that was really hard
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:03.320]   because I'm like, okay, I need a comprehensive
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:04.160]   amount of fetishes.
[02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:06.120]   I can't ask everybody to answer
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:07.560]   for every single niche fetish.
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:09.040]   I'm like, do you like ball gags?
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:10.080]   Do you like funnel gags?
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:13.240]   Do you like wife shrew gags or whatever?
[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:14.320]   I'm like, you can't do that.
[02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:15.640]   Nobody's gonna finish that survey.
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:16.480]   - Okay, fine.
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:17.320]   (laughing)
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:19.120]   I'm not gonna ask questions.
[02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:20.560]   What's a wife shrew, but okay.
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:22.720]   - I'm not doing the, I'm trying to refer to like,
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:24.320]   there's like a thing that like--
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:25.640]   - Different types of gags.
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:26.480]   - Something like that.
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:27.360]   - Okay.
[02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:29.520]   - Yeah, different, so I'm like, so what I need to do
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:30.800]   is I need to ask people a question.
[02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:32.000]   Like, are you into like bondage?
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:33.720]   And if you say yes, then I'll go ask you
[02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:34.560]   all the bondage questions.
[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:35.400]   - Ah, got it.
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:37.200]   - Right, but then this seems simple,
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:39.080]   but then it's just exploded because I'm like,
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:41.200]   how do I categorize these fetishes?
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:43.760]   There's like, if you're into sploshing,
[02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:47.040]   which is like, you like sitting in cakes,
[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:49.520]   you like getting in mud, basically like kind of messy,
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:52.120]   sensory, like, is this a disgust thing?
[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:53.440]   Is it a humiliation thing?
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:55.040]   Is it a sensory thing?
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:57.120]   Like, which category, anyway.
[02:40:57.120 --> 02:40:59.680]   So it took me like two months of just agonizing
[02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:02.160]   over each fetish, 'cause you don't wanna miss a fetish.
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:04.000]   You don't wanna like have a really important thing
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:05.760]   that you accidentally put in a disgust category
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:08.160]   when it actually belongs in the humiliation category.
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:09.120]   You know?
[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:10.280]   - Well, let me think about that.
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:11.640]   'Cause like, you're still catching it,
[02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:14.360]   you're just miscategorizing it.
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:15.440]   - Right, 'cause if you're into sploshing,
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:17.040]   and you're like, this is clearly a humiliation thing,
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:18.720]   so you say, yes, I'm into humiliation stuff,
[02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:20.400]   and then I don't ask you about sploshing,
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:22.800]   then I'm missing a whole data set of people
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:24.400]   because I've falsely categorized your question.
[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:25.400]   - You're going to miss stuff,
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:29.120]   you're just picking what's less and less important to miss.
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:30.360]   - Well, I'm trying to get people
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:31.760]   into the right question set.
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:32.600]   - Sure.
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:34.040]   - 'Cause like, I can't ask you all the questions,
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:35.600]   I have to ask you a couple overarching questions
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:38.320]   to know what specific questions to ask you.
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:40.120]   And so I have to, those overarching questions
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:42.280]   have to be really, really well calibrated
[02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:43.760]   so that I can accurately feed you
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:45.800]   into the right sub part of the survey.
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:46.640]   - Awesome.
[02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:48.160]   - And so that was extremely difficult
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:49.400]   if I'm, when I'm dealing with,
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:51.200]   I think it was like 850 fetishes.
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:53.880]   So I did a couple things to spot check.
[02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:56.560]   I like, I did a couple questions where I asked,
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:41:58.080]   like in the detailed in the survey,
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:41:59.280]   but like also the beginning of the survey,
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:02.500]   just to see like what percentage people I was capturing.
[02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:06.080]   But, and then I scored the survey.
[02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:07.280]   So if you take it,
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:10.200]   I had other people answer preliminary surveys
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:11.880]   where they gave me data about how taboo
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:13.400]   the various fetishes were.
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:16.680]   And then I use that data so that when you fill out the survey
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:18.360]   it's extremely comprehensive and you get data
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:20.400]   about exactly how taboo your interests are.
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:21.360]   And then you get a score at the end
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:24.560]   and I give you an equivalent kinky character,
[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:26.040]   which I also had people write a whole bunch
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:28.120]   of fictional characters and some historic ones
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:29.320]   about like how kinky they were.
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:32.000]   So then I matched the historic character,
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.160]   kinky character to your score.
[02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:35.600]   - So that makes it like more fun,
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:37.120]   like gamifies it a little bit.
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:39.920]   And you can, like, you can brag about like how-
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:41.400]   - To be able to share it with others.
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:42.720]   And a lot of the characters were like goofy,
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:46.480]   like, like there's SpongeBob and like Hitler's on there
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:48.800]   and you know, South Park characters.
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:51.000]   - What is, what kink does Hitler have?
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.400]   - I think he's like, he's around Marilyn Monroe,
[02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:57.080]   which is like a slightly above average kinkyness.
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:42:57.920]   - Oh, sorry.
[02:42:57.920 --> 02:43:02.120]   I thought there was like a two dimensional space somehow.
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:04.000]   So this is like a literally from zero to-
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:05.040]   - How kinky, yeah.
[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:06.800]   - So Hitler is about as a Marilyn Monroe.
[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:09.040]   Who is the most, what's the character for like-
[02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:10.240]   - Willy Wonka.
[02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:11.080]   - Is the most kinky?
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:13.160]   - Was the most kinky, yeah.
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:14.600]   I think like maybe Captain America
[02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:17.280]   was the least kinky or something or Gandhi.
[02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:21.880]   - Meanwhile, but that's another conversation.
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:24.160]   Oh boy.
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:26.720]   - Yeah, so it went viral on TikTok basically
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:27.800]   'cause people were like, what?
[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:29.080]   I got this insane character.
[02:43:29.080 --> 02:43:34.080]   And then the sample size exploded from 40,000 to 500,000.
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:37.640]   - Wow, so like all it took is that kind of incentive?
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:40.480]   Or did you like at first have to pay people for this?
[02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:42.120]   - No, it was just that incentive.
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:46.280]   - And what about the demographic
[02:43:46.280 --> 02:43:47.760]   of the different people that took it?
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:50.160]   - Mostly younger, so usually early twenties,
[02:43:50.160 --> 02:43:53.160]   predominantly female, like 70% female.
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:54.160]   - 70% female.
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:57.240]   - Pretty like, wraps on a TikTok demographics pretty well.
[02:43:57.240 --> 02:43:59.040]   - Oh, okay, I got it.
[02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:00.040]   That's interesting.
[02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:04.240]   Young people are probably better for this kind of survey
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:05.680]   because there's probably a culture
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:08.400]   that's a little bit more honest about their sexuality.
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:09.320]   - Yeah, most likely.
[02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:11.200]   I think people are incentivized to be honest
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:14.160]   when they're getting a true identity response out of it.
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:17.000]   Like if you're doing it for money, you don't care.
[02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.200]   But like if you are invested in the result,
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:22.320]   you want to know what the truth of the answers are,
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:23.920]   then you actually-
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:26.280]   - There's possibly you also don't want to know the truth.
[02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:27.400]   - Yeah, this is true.
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:29.080]   - But on average, hopefully that doesn't.
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:30.360]   I mean, these are really difficult.
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:32.800]   Like what, is there some interesting little quirks
[02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:37.160]   that people should know about your methodology
[02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:39.120]   that you had to kind of solve
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:41.360]   to try to get to a really good survey?
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:43.640]   So one of you said is the categorization
[02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:44.920]   to make it more efficient.
[02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:46.920]   Is there some for the analysis part?
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:49.120]   - Yeah, so the graph that you were talking about
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:51.360]   is a binary.
[02:44:51.360 --> 02:44:53.200]   So it's like, if somebody expressed
[02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:54.360]   even a little bit of interest,
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:55.480]   then it goes into the graph.
[02:44:55.480 --> 02:44:57.520]   So it's like 80% of people expressed
[02:44:57.520 --> 02:44:58.440]   even a little bit of interest.
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:00.800]   So it's not representing degree of interest.
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:02.400]   It's not differentiating between them at all.
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:03.920]   So it's possible that like some fetishes
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:05.600]   have exactly the same amount of people
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:07.000]   like are at least a little bit into them,
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:08.960]   but one of them it's very extreme interest
[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:12.800]   and the other is like vague and not very intense.
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:14.720]   So that's not reflected.
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:16.120]   I also like probably didn't represent
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:18.480]   the visual part right.
[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:20.600]   Like it might not be intuitive, but-
[02:45:20.600 --> 02:45:22.080]   - So you chose a log scale,
[02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:24.120]   but it was kind of spreads things out
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:26.400]   to make it more clear.
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:28.600]   - 'Cause the linear, it was just so clustered at the bottom.
[02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:30.440]   You couldn't really separate it out.
[02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:32.440]   So there's obviously a selection effects as possible
[02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:34.840]   that like the identity results at the end
[02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:36.960]   impacted people's results a little bit.
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:39.640]   But the thing is like, I'm comparing it to what exists,
[02:45:39.640 --> 02:45:42.040]   like what is the alternative?
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:44.840]   And right now the research on this stuff is terrible.
[02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:47.120]   So it's like, I'm not saying my research is perfect,
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:48.520]   but it's like, at least it's something,
[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:49.680]   like it's something that's pointing us
[02:45:49.680 --> 02:45:51.840]   maybe in a direction that we might be able
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:52.800]   to do more research on.
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:54.480]   - And you're making the data available.
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:58.680]   - Yeah, I'm doing it slowly because there's so,
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:01.600]   I ask about so many questions, it's like not very anonymized.
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:02.840]   So I'm really seeing the small sections
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:03.920]   of the data at a time.
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:04.740]   - Yeah.
[02:46:04.740 --> 02:46:09.440]   Have you published in like journals and stuff?
[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:10.280]   - No, I haven't.
[02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:13.280]   - Do you have any interest in that or is your approach?
[02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:14.760]   - I'm like, I'm conflicted about it.
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:16.720]   Like it sounds cool because then I could be like,
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:18.240]   ha ha, I'm publishing a journal.
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:20.120]   But then people who are yelling about me
[02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:21.680]   who don't know anything about statistics on Twitter,
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:23.520]   like that I can go like shove it in their face.
[02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:26.960]   - But then you're also giving in to the silly criticism.
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:28.160]   - Like I don't, like I want,
[02:46:28.160 --> 02:46:31.840]   I feel so passionate about extra science,
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:33.360]   like science that you can just do.
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:35.380]   Like I wanna make science accessible.
[02:46:35.380 --> 02:46:38.400]   Like anybody can just go look and learn about the basics
[02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:40.840]   of like doing a survey or figuring out
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:42.280]   how to interpret information.
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:46.320]   And doing a published journal feels like
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:48.880]   I'm betraying my cause a little bit.
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:50.720]   - That's often behind a paywall.
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:52.900]   Yeah, it goes against the,
[02:46:52.900 --> 02:46:56.160]   I mean, I think you not publishing in a journal
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:58.320]   is doing a big public service.
[02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:01.040]   - Aw, I think it's the first time I've heard that.
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:01.880]   Thank you.
[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:04.560]   - Oh, like just coming from like on this topic,
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:08.800]   the elitism I see on the psychology side
[02:47:08.800 --> 02:47:10.480]   with the journals and the academia,
[02:47:10.480 --> 02:47:13.140]   the positions and the institutions you come from,
[02:47:13.140 --> 02:47:15.260]   all of that, that goes against,
[02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:19.920]   I think that's more useful for math and computer science
[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:23.440]   and so on, where there's like clear,
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:29.560]   but even then, even then, code is code, data is data.
[02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:32.000]   Like prestige shouldn't matter at all.
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:37.640]   Maybe for like biological experiments,
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:40.160]   like virology or something like that,
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:42.240]   it's good to be from a major lab
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:44.880]   that has a reputation for like
[02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:46.280]   going through all the procedures,
[02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:48.480]   like you know you can trust.
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:51.200]   But here, like you're dealing with a giant mess of humanity.
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:54.320]   Like it's beautiful to be transparent, to be raw,
[02:47:54.320 --> 02:47:56.160]   to be exploring it together with everybody.
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:47:57.000]   Yeah, it's really beautiful.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:58.960]   - I think people like have a lot of incentive
[02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:00.120]   to doubt the results.
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:01.600]   Like a lot of the research I'm doing
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:03.420]   is to like cis and trans people.
[02:48:03.420 --> 02:48:06.840]   Like we don't have any data about transsexuality,
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:09.040]   like not very good at least.
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:09.880]   And I'm really curious,
[02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:11.280]   I don't really have an agenda about it.
[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:13.560]   I think like being trans is cool
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:14.840]   if you wanna be trans, do it.
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:17.800]   And like I have some skepticism about like gender theory,
[02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:19.600]   but like it doesn't come down to impact
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:21.080]   like the way I think trans people should be treated,
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:22.840]   which I think is like treat them,
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:25.240]   be fucking nice and human about it, I don't know.
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:27.260]   But when I'm talking about the thing,
[02:48:27.260 --> 02:48:29.360]   like my conclusions are that like
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:31.240]   transsexuality is really unique.
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:35.720]   It's not like cis or cis woman or man sexuality at all.
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:37.080]   And to me, this is super cool,
[02:48:37.080 --> 02:48:38.080]   but like a lot of people,
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:39.880]   this is very politicized right now.
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:43.160]   Like the data into like transsexual preferences,
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:45.000]   like it's so loaded, which is really sad
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:48.040]   because I am very accepting of weird sexuality.
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:49.000]   Like if you're into a weird thing,
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:50.960]   I'm like, good for you, this is super cool.
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:52.480]   Like let's figure out how to make it
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:54.380]   so that you can explore the thing you're into
[02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:55.920]   without any stigma.
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:48:57.320]   But because there's so much stigma
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:48:58.860]   that like if you find that one demographic
[02:48:58.860 --> 02:49:00.660]   is into weirder sex stuff than the other,
[02:49:00.660 --> 02:49:02.100]   like it's hard to present that in a way
[02:49:02.100 --> 02:49:03.720]   that people don't weaponize.
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:06.680]   So it's been really politically touchy subject here.
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:08.040]   - Yeah, but you do it in a way that's not,
[02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:11.000]   it's not feel like it has an agenda, right?
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:12.280]   You're just exploring.
[02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:15.720]   - Yeah, I feel pretty open to what I'm gonna find.
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:18.480]   Like I often have no idea what the data is gonna tell me.
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:19.320]   And I'm like, I pre-commit like,
[02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:21.000]   okay, I could say A, B, or C,
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.500]   and I'm like down to publish any of those findings.
[02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:29.560]   - So you've put together an ask whole cart deck
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:32.000]   with a lot of awesome questions to ask at a party
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:36.640]   or anywhere, honestly, including on the podcast.
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:39.200]   Let me ask you one from that deck.
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:41.300]   Is sex really about power?
[02:49:41.300 --> 02:49:43.640]   So what's the role of power dynamics in sex?
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:45.440]   Is that everything you understand?
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:46.600]   Like from the survey,
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:49.360]   in terms of what people are turned on by,
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:51.440]   you've talked about like the preferences
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:53.800]   that women versus men have
[02:49:53.800 --> 02:49:56.120]   for like submissiveness and dominance.
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:49:59.240]   And we've already talked about it a little bit,
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:02.000]   but like it's expressed more strongly.
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:03.280]   Yeah, I already forget the results,
[02:50:03.280 --> 02:50:05.800]   but I feel like women have more preference to be submissive.
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:06.840]   - Yeah, this is one of the things
[02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:09.660]   that got me into researching fetishes to begin with,
[02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:11.600]   because I think I came across some data.
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:13.200]   I did like a brief survey where
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:16.680]   roughly around 60% of women report being submissive
[02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:18.840]   and 40% of men report being dominant.
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:20.280]   And this was really fascinating to me.
[02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:21.680]   I'm like, well, why is there this gap?
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:24.040]   Like, why do we not?
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:25.600]   'Cause I guess I have some priors
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:27.600]   that maybe this is an evolutionary thing.
[02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:29.560]   Like the submission dominant, like strong men,
[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:30.680]   and you know, like women being like,
[02:50:30.680 --> 02:50:32.360]   oh, this hot man, you know,
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:33.880]   the men are like ravaging and stuff.
[02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:36.160]   I'm like, shouldn't this be in our genes?
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:37.880]   But there's a gap.
[02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:39.840]   - What's the gap?
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:41.320]   - The gap is the dominant submissive gap.
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:44.040]   More women are submissive than there are dominant men.
[02:50:44.040 --> 02:50:45.880]   - Oh, wait, really?
[02:50:45.880 --> 02:50:48.160]   - Yeah, it's a pretty significant gap.
[02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:50.180]   And this is held up, like it depends on what you're testing.
[02:50:50.180 --> 02:50:51.120]   I've tested a bunch of things.
[02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:53.160]   This is part of why I did this big survey.
[02:50:53.160 --> 02:50:54.000]   - Nice.
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:55.740]   - But it depends against, again,
[02:50:55.740 --> 02:50:57.460]   on like what kind of dominance you're measuring,
[02:50:57.460 --> 02:51:00.280]   but overall it's a roughly 40 to 60%.
[02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:02.760]   - So when you say there's not many dominant men,
[02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:05.880]   the meaning like they express like a desire
[02:51:05.880 --> 02:51:07.560]   to be dominant in a relationship?
[02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:09.480]   - Yeah, or like sexually.
[02:51:09.480 --> 02:51:10.320]   - Sexually.
[02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:11.140]   - Sexually, in bed.
[02:51:11.140 --> 02:51:12.600]   So like if I ask questions like,
[02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:14.400]   how much do you like being dominant in bed?
[02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:16.800]   Like men are less likely to answer strong yes
[02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:17.880]   to that question.
[02:51:17.880 --> 02:51:20.560]   But if I ask, are you likely to be submissive?
[02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:23.160]   Like women are very much yes.
[02:51:23.160 --> 02:51:24.000]   - Really?
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:25.000]   And that's expressive?
[02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:28.680]   Like that represents truth?
[02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:29.520]   - My guess is--
[02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:30.340]   - What's wrong with men?
[02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:32.120]   - So this is, I think there's some reflection
[02:51:32.120 --> 02:51:32.960]   on like FetLife.
[02:51:32.960 --> 02:51:34.560]   So FetLife is this website where people like sign up
[02:51:34.560 --> 02:51:36.520]   and connect based on their fetishes.
[02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:37.360]   And this is like,
[02:51:37.360 --> 02:51:39.680]   you can kind of see it picked up in the forum posts
[02:51:39.680 --> 02:51:41.880]   about like how like dominant men are, you know,
[02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:43.120]   are getting laid so much.
[02:51:43.120 --> 02:51:45.600]   And you know, submissives are always looking for a dominant.
[02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:47.520]   Like there's, it's an unequal market.
[02:51:47.520 --> 02:51:48.360]   - Holy shit.
[02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:49.180]   - Yeah.
[02:51:49.180 --> 02:51:50.020]   - This is great news.
[02:51:50.020 --> 02:51:51.400]   (laughing)
[02:51:51.400 --> 02:51:52.240]   I didn't know this.
[02:51:52.240 --> 02:51:53.080]   That's interesting.
[02:51:53.080 --> 02:51:53.900]   - Yeah.
[02:51:53.900 --> 02:51:55.800]   - What does it reflect about modern society?
[02:51:55.800 --> 02:51:57.160]   Is it like, is that,
[02:51:57.160 --> 02:51:58.320]   'cause you know, there's these trends
[02:51:58.320 --> 02:52:00.920]   about like decreased masculinity or that kind of stuff.
[02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:02.880]   Does that reflect, is that similar?
[02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:04.640]   - I'm trying not to hold onto one theory
[02:52:04.640 --> 02:52:05.480]   'cause I'm not sure.
[02:52:05.480 --> 02:52:08.720]   One is possible like decreasing testosterone levels.
[02:52:08.720 --> 02:52:10.000]   Testosterone seems to be,
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:11.360]   I have a little bit of other research,
[02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:12.580]   but I'm still checking it out.
[02:52:12.580 --> 02:52:14.720]   That seems to indicate that higher testosterone,
[02:52:14.720 --> 02:52:16.200]   you're more likely to be dominant.
[02:52:16.200 --> 02:52:18.000]   So if we're seeing decreased testosterone levels
[02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:21.380]   across society, we should be seeing a greater gap.
[02:52:21.380 --> 02:52:23.680]   - This is so fascinating.
[02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:25.920]   Once again, this is like a super interesting way
[02:52:25.920 --> 02:52:27.280]   to look at humanity.
[02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:29.160]   'Cause it is such an important part of humanity.
[02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:31.120]   And so like how many people are doing
[02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:33.440]   large scale research like this?
[02:52:33.440 --> 02:52:35.640]   I feel like you're like at the top of the world.
[02:52:35.640 --> 02:52:37.640]   You're like world-class at the top of the world
[02:52:37.640 --> 02:52:39.040]   doing research on this stuff.
[02:52:39.040 --> 02:52:40.640]   - Yeah, I think I might have the biggest,
[02:52:40.640 --> 02:52:44.140]   most comprehensive fetish data set in the world right now.
[02:52:44.140 --> 02:52:47.120]   - That's epic.
[02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:47.960]   - Thank you.
[02:52:47.960 --> 02:52:49.360]   I'm really happy about it.
[02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:50.240]   I'm very proud.
[02:52:50.240 --> 02:52:51.080]   - Yeah.
[02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:53.360]   And it's, you know, it's probably growing,
[02:52:53.360 --> 02:52:56.300]   but it's also enabling you to establish a name
[02:52:56.300 --> 02:52:57.880]   to where you, like a prestige,
[02:52:57.880 --> 02:52:59.840]   like a reputation to where people can go to you
[02:52:59.840 --> 02:53:01.600]   to like trust you more and more,
[02:53:01.600 --> 02:53:03.360]   to do longer surveys perhaps.
[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:05.360]   - Maybe.
[02:53:05.360 --> 02:53:08.360]   I think the data analysis afterwards is very different
[02:53:08.360 --> 02:53:10.560]   from like the survey design itself.
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:14.400]   So I'm still very amateur at the data analysis.
[02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:16.000]   - Yeah, but you can always catch up on that.
[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.760]   I guess the data analysis does enable you to,
[02:53:18.760 --> 02:53:20.680]   does teach you how to ask better questions
[02:53:20.680 --> 02:53:21.520]   in order to understand.
[02:53:21.520 --> 02:53:22.600]   - Yes, it goes back and forth.
[02:53:22.600 --> 02:53:23.800]   Like as I'm looking at the data,
[02:53:23.800 --> 02:53:27.000]   it informs the way I wanna phrase questions the next time.
[02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.040]   - So women are more, at least in private,
[02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:32.920]   able to say that they would like to be submissive
[02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:34.860]   and men, even in private, are not,
[02:53:34.860 --> 02:53:38.400]   disproportionately saying they're not
[02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:40.400]   willing to be dominant.
[02:53:40.400 --> 02:53:41.240]   - Yeah.
[02:53:41.240 --> 02:53:42.320]   So it's possible. - What the fuck?
[02:53:42.320 --> 02:53:44.320]   - If this is caused by decreasing testosterone levels,
[02:53:44.320 --> 02:53:45.640]   then this means that we're probably having
[02:53:45.640 --> 02:53:47.080]   less satisfying sex overall.
[02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:49.280]   Like we're becoming less and less sexually compatible
[02:53:49.280 --> 02:53:50.120]   as time goes on.
[02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:52.040]   To be fair, I'm not sure that it is connected
[02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:52.920]   to testosterone levels.
[02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:55.580]   Like it's possible that this is just like a genetic thing.
[02:53:55.580 --> 02:53:58.380]   Like the gay uncle theory, like the idea is like,
[02:53:58.380 --> 02:54:00.460]   maybe gay people evolved to like be sort of
[02:54:00.460 --> 02:54:03.380]   taking themselves out of the gene pool to be assistants.
[02:54:03.380 --> 02:54:04.940]   And like, it's possible that like,
[02:54:04.940 --> 02:54:06.580]   there's certain percentage of men sort of like,
[02:54:06.580 --> 02:54:08.580]   quote unquote, evolved to be submissive,
[02:54:08.580 --> 02:54:11.160]   to take themselves out of sexual competition
[02:54:11.160 --> 02:54:13.740]   and to instead be like the monkeys
[02:54:13.740 --> 02:54:15.660]   revolving at the edge of the pack.
[02:54:15.660 --> 02:54:16.500]   It's unclear.
[02:54:16.500 --> 02:54:17.940]   - Oh, it's a method of survival?
[02:54:17.940 --> 02:54:19.980]   Like, so you stay out of the competition?
[02:54:19.980 --> 02:54:22.020]   - Yeah, and I'm like a little sus about
[02:54:22.020 --> 02:54:24.180]   these kinds of evo psych theories.
[02:54:24.180 --> 02:54:26.340]   So I'm not, I'm just saying it because it's like--
[02:54:26.340 --> 02:54:29.020]   - These are different ideas that are possible, yeah, okay.
[02:54:29.020 --> 02:54:31.300]   - So yeah, I'm not saying that it's definitely testosterone,
[02:54:31.300 --> 02:54:32.300]   there's other things.
[02:54:32.300 --> 02:54:34.080]   It's also possible that it's culture.
[02:54:34.080 --> 02:54:35.380]   People are definitely gonna bring that up.
[02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:36.900]   Based on my survey though,
[02:54:36.900 --> 02:54:38.900]   it doesn't seem to be any evidence of that.
[02:54:38.900 --> 02:54:42.020]   Like I asked about like how much pressure was put on you
[02:54:42.020 --> 02:54:44.780]   to be, you know, agentee in your childhood.
[02:54:44.780 --> 02:54:47.220]   Like a lot of questions around this kind of thing
[02:54:47.220 --> 02:54:49.500]   and no correlation at all to dominance.
[02:54:49.500 --> 02:54:51.620]   - Well, related to sexuality,
[02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:56.860]   I'm very uncomfortable right now, but nevertheless--
[02:54:56.860 --> 02:54:57.740]   - Plow forward.
[02:54:57.740 --> 02:55:00.980]   - In a dominant fashion.
[02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:08.820]   The blog post titled "Rape Spectrum Survey Results."
[02:55:08.820 --> 02:55:13.820]   What are the key takeaways from that survey?
[02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:15.940]   - So I did the survey when I had a friend be like,
[02:55:15.940 --> 02:55:17.980]   "Hey, I had this confusing sexual experience.
[02:55:17.980 --> 02:55:19.500]   "Was it rape?"
[02:55:19.500 --> 02:55:21.380]   Like somebody kind of pressured her
[02:55:21.380 --> 02:55:23.020]   and she eventually stopped saying it or something.
[02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:23.860]   I was like, "That's a great question.
[02:55:23.860 --> 02:55:26.100]   "Like I don't know how people would consider this."
[02:55:26.100 --> 02:55:30.740]   And so I put a whole bunch of different gray scenarios
[02:55:30.740 --> 02:55:32.460]   into a survey and then asked people to rate
[02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:34.140]   how rapey they thought that scenario was.
[02:55:34.140 --> 02:55:37.740]   - So you actually like little narratives
[02:55:37.740 --> 02:55:39.540]   that they get to rate.
[02:55:39.540 --> 02:55:41.740]   - Like, you know, this person is on a date with this person,
[02:55:41.740 --> 02:55:43.700]   they get drunk and the other person's not drunk.
[02:55:43.700 --> 02:55:47.540]   I try to keep gender neutral names for all of them.
[02:55:47.540 --> 02:55:50.620]   - And you reduce them into a more concise description
[02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:51.660]   of the situation.
[02:55:51.660 --> 02:55:52.500]   - Yeah.
[02:55:52.500 --> 02:55:53.320]   - Like in this visualization,
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:56.060]   so you have this rape spectrum that's a result.
[02:55:56.060 --> 02:55:56.900]   - Yeah.
[02:55:56.900 --> 02:55:59.100]   - Where on top are things that are less likely
[02:55:59.100 --> 02:56:01.300]   to be considered rape by the people that took the survey
[02:56:01.300 --> 02:56:03.420]   and the bottom more likely.
[02:56:03.420 --> 02:56:07.900]   The likeliest is a stranger forcibly assaults someone
[02:56:07.900 --> 02:56:09.980]   who screams and fights the entire time.
[02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:11.140]   That gets 100.
[02:56:11.140 --> 02:56:15.380]   What do we make of something that's not zero?
[02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:16.980]   It's like a 12 is what?
[02:56:16.980 --> 02:56:17.820]   What is that?
[02:56:17.820 --> 02:56:19.380]   How are we supposed to interpret a 12 out of 100
[02:56:19.380 --> 02:56:20.580]   as a rape? - Extremely low.
[02:56:20.580 --> 02:56:21.420]   - Okay.
[02:56:21.420 --> 02:56:24.140]   - So it's like not zero, but it's just very close to it.
[02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:29.140]   - Having sex with an enthusiastic sex worker is a 12.
[02:56:29.140 --> 02:56:31.060]   That's the lowest one.
[02:56:31.060 --> 02:56:34.780]   And there's a few, I'll just mention a few that are lower,
[02:56:34.780 --> 02:56:37.020]   like at that level.
[02:56:37.020 --> 02:56:40.000]   Have sex to make a partner happy in a relationship,
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:43.980]   lying about wealth, hobbies in order to get laid.
[02:56:43.980 --> 02:56:46.820]   Person with Down syndrome eagerly has sex
[02:56:46.820 --> 02:56:50.540]   with a neurotypical, not revealing being transgender.
[02:56:50.540 --> 02:56:52.700]   Until after sex and so on.
[02:56:52.700 --> 02:56:54.140]   I think you mentioned that there's some,
[02:56:54.140 --> 02:56:57.540]   like that not revealing being transgender until after sex,
[02:56:57.540 --> 02:57:00.500]   there's some differences amongst what,
[02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:02.340]   men and women or something like that?
[02:57:02.340 --> 02:57:04.740]   - I think that was the one that men found more offensive
[02:57:04.740 --> 02:57:05.660]   than women.
[02:57:05.660 --> 02:57:07.560]   I'm trying to, I wrote it a while ago.
[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:13.460]   - I mean, this is nuanced and difficult, right?
[02:57:13.460 --> 02:57:15.700]   'Cause I think in a lot of public discourse,
[02:57:15.700 --> 02:57:17.620]   the word rape is pretty binary.
[02:57:17.620 --> 02:57:20.580]   - Yeah, it's like either is or is not rape.
[02:57:20.580 --> 02:57:24.020]   - And so you had a friend where it was like, this felt rapey.
[02:57:24.020 --> 02:57:25.780]   - Yeah, she's like confused about how to interpret it.
[02:57:25.780 --> 02:57:27.780]   I think people look to the terms
[02:57:27.780 --> 02:57:29.700]   to know how to feel about something.
[02:57:29.700 --> 02:57:31.300]   Like, have you ever like been through an experience,
[02:57:31.300 --> 02:57:32.180]   you're like, that was weird.
[02:57:32.180 --> 02:57:33.500]   And then you tell it to somebody else and they're like,
[02:57:33.500 --> 02:57:35.620]   oh my God, you were assaulted.
[02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:37.620]   And then it totally recontextualizes
[02:57:37.620 --> 02:57:38.940]   the thing that you've experienced.
[02:57:38.940 --> 02:57:41.420]   And I think that this is clunky with the word rape
[02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:43.440]   because either you were raped or you're not.
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:45.540]   You either like have this entire context,
[02:57:45.540 --> 02:57:47.260]   like thrust upon you or you don't.
[02:57:47.260 --> 02:57:49.620]   And we're really not nuanced about it at all.
[02:57:49.620 --> 02:57:51.340]   And so I would really like to have some sort of like,
[02:57:51.340 --> 02:57:53.700]   oh, that was like a 30% rape you just endured.
[02:57:53.700 --> 02:57:57.300]   - Yeah, and I mean, there's probably other dimensions
[02:57:57.300 --> 02:57:58.500]   about how traumatic it is,
[02:57:58.500 --> 02:58:00.500]   how difficult it is to recover from,
[02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:02.420]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:58:02.420 --> 02:58:04.020]   Yeah, I mean, like people,
[02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:07.220]   it's a dangerous thing to assign a word to an experience,
[02:58:07.220 --> 02:58:08.900]   like even, or to a relationship,
[02:58:08.900 --> 02:58:11.460]   like saying a toxic relationship.
[02:58:11.460 --> 02:58:12.300]   - Yeah.
[02:58:12.300 --> 02:58:14.060]   - That can completely destroy your perception
[02:58:14.060 --> 02:58:15.660]   of that relationship.
[02:58:15.660 --> 02:58:16.500]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:18.100]   I remember this was the case with my childhood.
[02:58:18.100 --> 02:58:19.260]   Like I talked about being very abusive,
[02:58:19.260 --> 02:58:20.300]   but I've talked about how like
[02:58:20.300 --> 02:58:21.820]   there was a good amount of meaning there
[02:58:21.820 --> 02:58:24.700]   so that I didn't process it as abusive at the time.
[02:58:24.700 --> 02:58:27.260]   I remember after I got out of that house in that culture,
[02:58:27.260 --> 02:58:29.820]   people would tell me, oh, your childhood was really abusive.
[02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:31.660]   And I was really confused by that
[02:58:31.660 --> 02:58:35.160]   because it's a total recontextualization of that narrative.
[02:58:35.160 --> 02:58:36.860]   It's like the things that I went through were not,
[02:58:36.860 --> 02:58:39.020]   you know, good and virtuous and had meaning,
[02:58:39.020 --> 02:58:41.140]   but rather those were like the result of, you know,
[02:58:41.140 --> 02:58:44.300]   parents who didn't like love you enough or something.
[02:58:44.300 --> 02:58:47.980]   And even though the concrete things that happened to me
[02:58:47.980 --> 02:58:50.800]   did not change, like no facts shifted,
[02:58:50.800 --> 02:58:53.540]   the fact that like the interpretation of the facts shifted
[02:58:53.540 --> 02:58:56.220]   caused me quite a bit of distress for a long time.
[02:58:56.220 --> 02:58:59.100]   I was like, oh my God, I'm a traumatized, like abused person.
[02:58:59.100 --> 02:59:00.740]   Like I went through an abusive childhood
[02:59:00.740 --> 02:59:03.040]   and it was really hard for me, made it worse.
[02:59:03.040 --> 02:59:06.340]   Like it's crazy the power that terms have.
[02:59:06.340 --> 02:59:07.820]   - I think we didn't talk about this,
[02:59:07.820 --> 02:59:10.260]   but how did you begin to overcome
[02:59:10.260 --> 02:59:13.540]   the trauma of your childhood?
[02:59:13.540 --> 02:59:15.460]   You mentioned LSD, so drugs are part of it.
[02:59:15.460 --> 02:59:18.220]   Like what was the mental journey of that?
[02:59:18.220 --> 02:59:21.300]   - I was doing LSD quite a lot when I was 21, 22.
[02:59:21.300 --> 02:59:22.340]   - What's it like, by the way?
[02:59:22.340 --> 02:59:24.140]   I've never done LSD, what's it?
[02:59:24.140 --> 02:59:27.260]   - Very difficult to describe because it's like,
[02:59:27.260 --> 02:59:30.460]   like it changes sort of aspects about your environment
[02:59:30.460 --> 02:59:33.220]   that are invisible to you because they're so stable.
[02:59:33.220 --> 02:59:36.380]   - Is it like, if you can compare it to like psilocybin,
[02:59:36.380 --> 02:59:37.220]   is it very different?
[02:59:37.220 --> 02:59:39.060]   - Oh yeah, it's like similar.
[02:59:39.060 --> 02:59:40.140]   I forgot that you did shrooms.
[02:59:40.140 --> 02:59:41.440]   Yeah, okay, then you probably know.
[02:59:41.440 --> 02:59:42.780]   You know, like the kind of shift that you have
[02:59:42.780 --> 02:59:45.140]   from the sober to shrooms is roughly similar.
[02:59:45.140 --> 02:59:46.920]   It's like more clear, I think.
[02:59:46.920 --> 02:59:48.260]   Shrooms is more like embodied,
[02:59:48.260 --> 02:59:51.180]   but LSD is much more intellectual for me.
[02:59:51.180 --> 02:59:52.280]   It strikes different people differently.
[02:59:52.280 --> 02:59:53.300]   I prefer shrooms a lot.
[02:59:53.300 --> 02:59:55.660]   I'm sorry, LSD, I prefer LSD a lot.
[02:59:55.660 --> 02:59:57.460]   - Why is it not popularly taken?
[02:59:57.460 --> 03:00:00.580]   Like there seems to be a negative connotation to LSD
[03:00:00.580 --> 03:00:03.260]   'cause like it seems to potentially have
[03:00:03.260 --> 03:00:04.620]   like a destructive effect.
[03:00:04.620 --> 03:00:06.980]   Like maybe dosage is more difficult to get right
[03:00:06.980 --> 03:00:07.820]   or something like that.
[03:00:07.820 --> 03:00:09.500]   - Does this exactly, so actually a long time ago,
[03:00:09.500 --> 03:00:11.700]   I did a survey on shrooms versus LSD.
[03:00:11.700 --> 03:00:14.220]   So I asked people and people had slightly stronger
[03:00:14.220 --> 03:00:16.020]   experiences on LSD overall, I remember,
[03:00:16.020 --> 03:00:18.420]   but rated the experiences about is equally good.
[03:00:18.420 --> 03:00:20.460]   But I think people like shrooms
[03:00:20.460 --> 03:00:22.260]   'cause it feels more natural, quote unquote.
[03:00:22.260 --> 03:00:24.660]   But I think if you like fed somebody a shroom
[03:00:24.660 --> 03:00:26.420]   and like actually had the LSD molecule in it,
[03:00:26.420 --> 03:00:28.460]   they would have a, they would think it felt very natural,
[03:00:28.460 --> 03:00:29.700]   but that's besides the point.
[03:00:29.700 --> 03:00:33.380]   I think people get kind of incoherent on LSD
[03:00:33.380 --> 03:00:35.440]   in a way that feels really alienating.
[03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:38.440]   Like I consider my LSD use very heavy
[03:00:38.440 --> 03:00:40.700]   to be one of the best decisions I ever made in my life,
[03:00:40.700 --> 03:00:43.220]   but I definitely was incoherent for a lot of it.
[03:00:43.220 --> 03:00:45.260]   Like talking about like we're all one consciousness,
[03:00:45.260 --> 03:00:46.780]   everything is love, man.
[03:00:46.780 --> 03:00:47.620]   You know, and people are like--
[03:00:47.620 --> 03:00:49.660]   - Why is that incoherent?
[03:00:49.660 --> 03:00:51.580]   - So I think it's not incoherent.
[03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:53.900]   But like if you go around saying everything is love,
[03:00:53.900 --> 03:00:56.820]   people are like, this guy's kind of blasted out of his mind.
[03:00:56.820 --> 03:01:00.500]   - This podcast is basically your LSD drive
[03:01:00.500 --> 03:01:02.980]   on the, for a bunch of episodes.
[03:01:02.980 --> 03:01:04.900]   Yeah, I get this for sure.
[03:01:04.900 --> 03:01:07.100]   Oh, well, it's not just about love,
[03:01:07.100 --> 03:01:11.180]   but it's about like talking in that way
[03:01:11.180 --> 03:01:12.700]   about reality, about the world.
[03:01:12.700 --> 03:01:13.740]   Yeah, sure.
[03:01:13.740 --> 03:01:15.140]   - It's like overfitting.
[03:01:15.140 --> 03:01:16.320]   The narratives that you make about the world
[03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:17.860]   become really vivid.
[03:01:17.860 --> 03:01:20.100]   And so you pattern match just really aggressively.
[03:01:20.100 --> 03:01:21.580]   Like everything is connected
[03:01:21.580 --> 03:01:23.300]   and you come up with these explanations for things.
[03:01:23.300 --> 03:01:24.780]   And I think I was very fortunate.
[03:01:24.780 --> 03:01:26.500]   So I like this theory about psychedelics
[03:01:26.500 --> 03:01:28.540]   where you either like belief construct or you don't.
[03:01:28.540 --> 03:01:31.740]   So you take psychedelics and it sort of like burns away
[03:01:31.740 --> 03:01:33.940]   a lot of your belief structure.
[03:01:33.940 --> 03:01:36.740]   And sometimes this happens
[03:01:36.740 --> 03:01:37.580]   and then you're like,
[03:01:37.580 --> 03:01:39.420]   "Oh, I need to like invent something to fill in the gaps."
[03:01:39.420 --> 03:01:42.780]   So you're like, "Okay, I think that maybe time is an illusion
[03:01:42.780 --> 03:01:45.020]   so I must now believe that like we're actually
[03:01:45.020 --> 03:01:47.860]   in a time loop or like time travel is possible."
[03:01:47.860 --> 03:01:49.220]   So you experience time differently
[03:01:49.220 --> 03:01:51.620]   and then you come up with a different belief about time.
[03:01:51.620 --> 03:01:54.420]   Whereas other people don't do this belief construction
[03:01:54.420 --> 03:01:56.380]   at all, like you experience time differently
[03:01:56.380 --> 03:01:58.580]   and you sort of let yourself not have a belief.
[03:01:58.580 --> 03:01:59.420]   You're not like, okay,
[03:01:59.420 --> 03:02:01.140]   and you're not developing any beliefs about time
[03:02:01.140 --> 03:02:02.100]   in its absence.
[03:02:02.100 --> 03:02:04.300]   You're just simply experiencing the absence
[03:02:04.300 --> 03:02:05.900]   of the concept of time.
[03:02:05.900 --> 03:02:08.780]   And so I don't have a lot of data to back this up
[03:02:08.780 --> 03:02:09.940]   in my anecdotal experience
[03:02:09.940 --> 03:02:11.320]   'cause I've tripped out a lot of people.
[03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:13.580]   People either tend to belief construct or they don't.
[03:02:13.580 --> 03:02:15.260]   And people who do not belief construct
[03:02:15.260 --> 03:02:17.340]   seem to get more out of their LSD trips.
[03:02:17.340 --> 03:02:18.580]   So if you can let a belief go
[03:02:18.580 --> 03:02:21.140]   without building anything in its absence,
[03:02:21.140 --> 03:02:22.540]   it's much more beneficial for you.
[03:02:22.540 --> 03:02:23.900]   And I think I just, for some reason,
[03:02:23.900 --> 03:02:25.580]   happen to have some brain that's constructed
[03:02:25.580 --> 03:02:29.260]   where I don't get a belief construction at all.
[03:02:29.260 --> 03:02:30.660]   - So that's really interesting
[03:02:30.660 --> 03:02:32.500]   that belief construction is negative.
[03:02:35.100 --> 03:02:36.380]   Is it necessarily negative?
[03:02:36.380 --> 03:02:37.780]   Can you elaborate on that a little bit?
[03:02:37.780 --> 03:02:40.180]   - I mean belief construction in a way that's like,
[03:02:40.180 --> 03:02:43.460]   not like playing with frames,
[03:02:43.460 --> 03:02:45.820]   but rather committing to a different frame.
[03:02:45.820 --> 03:02:48.220]   So I like being able to play with ideas
[03:02:48.220 --> 03:02:49.700]   and be like, let's look at it this way or that way.
[03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:50.540]   That's awesome.
[03:02:50.540 --> 03:02:52.100]   But if you're like, okay, you know what?
[03:02:52.100 --> 03:02:53.860]   I took LSD and now I absolutely believe
[03:02:53.860 --> 03:02:55.260]   the cops are outside.
[03:02:55.260 --> 03:02:56.700]   And you're like, dude, no, you're just like,
[03:02:56.700 --> 03:02:58.860]   you can't shift out of that, right?
[03:02:58.860 --> 03:03:00.680]   Your brain needs to fill in the gap.
[03:03:00.680 --> 03:03:01.700]   You're not allowed to have a gap,
[03:03:01.700 --> 03:03:03.260]   so you're not allowed to be flexible.
[03:03:03.260 --> 03:03:05.780]   And again, I don't think this is like a personal failing.
[03:03:05.780 --> 03:03:07.780]   I think this is like literally probably genetic
[03:03:07.780 --> 03:03:09.660]   or like physical thing that's causing this.
[03:03:09.660 --> 03:03:11.060]   - But do you think there's possible beliefs
[03:03:11.060 --> 03:03:13.780]   that are like enlightening that you can stick to?
[03:03:13.780 --> 03:03:16.620]   Like find a frame that like,
[03:03:16.620 --> 03:03:20.380]   I guess if you don't believe construct
[03:03:20.380 --> 03:03:22.140]   and you're escaping your previous beliefs,
[03:03:22.140 --> 03:03:23.820]   aren't you doing like just some,
[03:03:23.820 --> 03:03:25.660]   you're picking up a bigger frame in some way.
[03:03:25.660 --> 03:03:28.460]   - Yeah, I mean, you're taking your beliefs as object
[03:03:28.460 --> 03:03:29.900]   as opposed to being subject to them.
[03:03:29.900 --> 03:03:31.820]   - Ah, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[03:03:31.820 --> 03:03:33.220]   And some of that, I guess, is genetic
[03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:34.620]   and there's these categories of people,
[03:03:34.620 --> 03:03:36.580]   there's two categories that experience LSD
[03:03:36.580 --> 03:03:37.420]   in different ways.
[03:03:37.420 --> 03:03:38.300]   - Yeah. - And you're one of those
[03:03:38.300 --> 03:03:39.420]   that are able to just let go.
[03:03:39.420 --> 03:03:40.860]   - Yeah, I just think I had a good reaction.
[03:03:40.860 --> 03:03:44.060]   And I think a lot of maybe the negative stereotype of LSD
[03:03:44.060 --> 03:03:46.140]   comes from people who are belief constructing
[03:03:46.140 --> 03:03:48.620]   or carry the belief constructing off of the LSD trip.
[03:03:48.620 --> 03:03:49.620]   So you take LSD and you're like,
[03:03:49.620 --> 03:03:51.460]   ah, I'm believing these insane things.
[03:03:51.460 --> 03:03:52.980]   And people from the outside see that and they're like,
[03:03:52.980 --> 03:03:56.060]   oh my God, this person took LSD and became stupid.
[03:03:56.060 --> 03:03:56.960]   It's very scary.
[03:03:56.960 --> 03:03:59.820]   - What's frame control?
[03:03:59.820 --> 03:04:02.940]   'Cause that has been at the core of your trauma,
[03:04:02.940 --> 03:04:04.420]   at the core of your upbringing.
[03:04:04.420 --> 03:04:05.660]   What's frame control?
[03:04:05.660 --> 03:04:08.860]   And also, sorry, frame control in general,
[03:04:08.860 --> 03:04:12.540]   'cause that's part of human interaction.
[03:04:12.540 --> 03:04:15.060]   - Yeah, frame control is like a way
[03:04:15.060 --> 03:04:19.380]   of manipulating somebody else that is non-obvious.
[03:04:19.380 --> 03:04:22.060]   - So there's a negative connotation to that usually?
[03:04:22.060 --> 03:04:22.900]   - Yeah.
[03:04:22.900 --> 03:04:25.060]   I mean, I think maybe I chose the term kind of poorly
[03:04:25.060 --> 03:04:26.820]   'cause I think to some degree people are always
[03:04:26.820 --> 03:04:28.380]   a little bit manipulating each other.
[03:04:28.380 --> 03:04:29.660]   But I think it's generally obvious.
[03:04:29.660 --> 03:04:31.500]   Like for example, if I disagree with you,
[03:04:31.500 --> 03:04:33.540]   I want you to believe what I believe.
[03:04:33.540 --> 03:04:35.060]   But this is like an obvious thing
[03:04:35.060 --> 03:04:35.900]   that is visible between us.
[03:04:35.900 --> 03:04:37.340]   It's like an object on the table.
[03:04:37.340 --> 03:04:39.980]   It's like, here's the box where I want you to believe
[03:04:39.980 --> 03:04:42.020]   what you wanna believe. - The disagreement box.
[03:04:42.020 --> 03:04:44.900]   - Yeah, so we're under a shared context
[03:04:44.900 --> 03:04:48.380]   where we understand that we're trying to move each other.
[03:04:48.380 --> 03:04:49.420]   This is chill to me.
[03:04:49.420 --> 03:04:50.820]   I think this is cool.
[03:04:50.820 --> 03:04:52.460]   We do this all the time and it's important.
[03:04:52.460 --> 03:04:54.140]   But frame control is the kind of thing
[03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:55.660]   where you are trying carefully
[03:04:55.660 --> 03:04:58.300]   to obscure the existence of that box.
[03:04:58.300 --> 03:05:00.420]   You're like, oh, the thing that I'm doing,
[03:05:00.420 --> 03:05:03.100]   I'm like using tactics to try to influence
[03:05:03.100 --> 03:05:06.900]   what your reality is without us being both aware
[03:05:06.900 --> 03:05:07.820]   that this is what I'm doing.
[03:05:07.820 --> 03:05:11.460]   - Yeah, I've been assuming you're doing that the whole time.
[03:05:11.460 --> 03:05:12.700]   No. - Oh my God.
[03:05:12.700 --> 03:05:15.340]   I have to like figure out how to read
[03:05:15.340 --> 03:05:16.260]   your facial expressions.
[03:05:16.260 --> 03:05:17.500]   I'm still learning. - There's none.
[03:05:17.500 --> 03:05:18.860]   There's none. - You don't have any?
[03:05:18.860 --> 03:05:21.500]   - I'm like, I'm not even like a Chad GBT.
[03:05:21.500 --> 03:05:24.380]   I'm like GBT-1 with my facial expressions.
[03:05:24.380 --> 03:05:25.700]   Like it's kind of off.
[03:05:25.700 --> 03:05:27.380]   Like this doesn't seem to match emotions,
[03:05:27.380 --> 03:05:29.540]   but it's kind of intelligent seemingly,
[03:05:29.540 --> 03:05:31.060]   but definitely not conscious.
[03:05:31.060 --> 03:05:34.020]   Anyway, so like a negative connotation,
[03:05:34.020 --> 03:05:37.100]   manipulating, not being honest
[03:05:37.100 --> 03:05:42.100]   about the actual intentions of how you'd like
[03:05:42.100 --> 03:05:43.140]   to control the conversation.
[03:05:43.140 --> 03:05:44.820]   - And I think there might be a naive version
[03:05:44.820 --> 03:05:46.380]   of interpreting this where you're just like,
[03:05:46.380 --> 03:05:49.220]   oh, I'm trying to like subtly get you to believe like,
[03:05:49.220 --> 03:05:51.220]   oh, do you really think that's bad though?
[03:05:51.220 --> 03:05:52.740]   But this is not quite what I mean.
[03:05:52.740 --> 03:05:54.260]   I mean, there's like a couple of concrete things
[03:05:54.260 --> 03:05:55.660]   that are signs of frame control.
[03:05:55.660 --> 03:05:58.340]   Like one of them is pushing the painful update button,
[03:05:58.340 --> 03:06:00.780]   which is this thing where it's like,
[03:06:00.780 --> 03:06:04.500]   hey, if you learn this, it's going to be really painful.
[03:06:04.500 --> 03:06:05.980]   The truth is painful.
[03:06:05.980 --> 03:06:08.700]   And if you're realizing this thing about yourself,
[03:06:08.700 --> 03:06:09.540]   it's gonna hurt.
[03:06:09.540 --> 03:06:10.900]   And this is a sign that you're heading
[03:06:10.900 --> 03:06:11.940]   in the right direction.
[03:06:11.940 --> 03:06:14.940]   So if you frame all pain as a sign of virtue,
[03:06:14.940 --> 03:06:18.180]   then this means that pain that's resulting as damage
[03:06:18.180 --> 03:06:20.180]   is something you're going to ignore.
[03:06:20.180 --> 03:06:22.380]   So it's like this, it's a common like cults, right?
[03:06:22.380 --> 03:06:23.580]   This is for your own good.
[03:06:23.580 --> 03:06:27.300]   Oh, you know, you've faced a brave truth about yourself
[03:06:27.300 --> 03:06:29.900]   that you're like not quite as wise as I am.
[03:06:29.900 --> 03:06:31.300]   When really your brain might be trying
[03:06:31.300 --> 03:06:32.340]   to tell you protected things.
[03:06:32.340 --> 03:06:34.940]   Or like another one is like finger trap beliefs,
[03:06:34.940 --> 03:06:36.980]   where the belief is constructed in such a way
[03:06:36.980 --> 03:06:40.260]   that doubting it lends proof to the belief.
[03:06:40.260 --> 03:06:42.620]   So a very common example is like Satan.
[03:06:42.620 --> 03:06:44.700]   Like the Christians are like,
[03:06:44.700 --> 03:06:46.780]   Satan is going to try to make you doubt him,
[03:06:46.780 --> 03:06:48.380]   the existence of he's gonna so doubt,
[03:06:48.380 --> 03:06:50.260]   like maybe he's not actually real.
[03:06:50.260 --> 03:06:52.140]   And so if you believe in Satan and then you're like,
[03:06:52.140 --> 03:06:54.860]   okay, now I'm having doubts, like maybe he isn't real.
[03:06:54.860 --> 03:06:56.180]   This is like, oh, this is exactly
[03:06:56.180 --> 03:06:57.140]   what I was taught to expect.
[03:06:57.140 --> 03:07:00.420]   Like I am doubting this belief because I was told,
[03:07:00.420 --> 03:07:01.820]   because like this is what Satan does
[03:07:01.820 --> 03:07:03.540]   and it's taken as evidence for it.
[03:07:03.540 --> 03:07:05.460]   So like the attempt to move away from the belief,
[03:07:05.460 --> 03:07:08.780]   like rebounds on you and like causes you
[03:07:08.780 --> 03:07:11.380]   to be more embedded inside of the belief.
[03:07:11.380 --> 03:07:12.700]   So it's like techniques like these,
[03:07:12.700 --> 03:07:15.140]   like very subtle things where like being inside
[03:07:15.140 --> 03:07:17.900]   of this system sort of just self reinforces the system
[03:07:17.900 --> 03:07:19.980]   is what I consider to be frame control.
[03:07:19.980 --> 03:07:22.580]   - And have you met people that are really good
[03:07:22.580 --> 03:07:24.900]   at this kind of frame control?
[03:07:24.900 --> 03:07:26.740]   - Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[03:07:26.740 --> 03:07:30.220]   - So like you're saying that your father was like that?
[03:07:30.220 --> 03:07:31.860]   - Yeah, to be fair, I'm not sure he was good at it
[03:07:31.860 --> 03:07:33.220]   because I was a kid.
[03:07:33.220 --> 03:07:34.060]   - Right.
[03:07:34.060 --> 03:07:35.860]   - I think like he's probably not very good at it actually,
[03:07:35.860 --> 03:07:38.060]   but when you're a child being raised in a house
[03:07:38.060 --> 03:07:40.940]   where he works from home and you're homeschooled,
[03:07:40.940 --> 03:07:42.780]   that's just kind of what's going to happen.
[03:07:42.780 --> 03:07:44.980]   And to be fair, I do think that like strong frame control
[03:07:44.980 --> 03:07:45.940]   is quite rare.
[03:07:45.940 --> 03:07:47.940]   I don't think, most people are kind of doing something
[03:07:47.940 --> 03:07:49.740]   like this, but not nearly to the degree
[03:07:49.740 --> 03:07:51.060]   that makes, gives me the ick.
[03:07:51.060 --> 03:07:51.900]   - Yeah.
[03:07:51.900 --> 03:07:53.580]   - I've met maybe like five or six people,
[03:07:53.580 --> 03:07:55.580]   I think who I've really don't like
[03:07:55.580 --> 03:07:57.940]   because of those very subtle things that they're doing.
[03:07:57.940 --> 03:08:01.660]   - But I think also I'm starting to kind of understand
[03:08:01.660 --> 03:08:04.660]   that there is people who are narcissists
[03:08:04.660 --> 03:08:07.660]   and sociopaths and psychopaths out there.
[03:08:07.660 --> 03:08:12.100]   And I'm not even sure if people like that,
[03:08:12.100 --> 03:08:14.460]   'cause I think they get good at frame control,
[03:08:14.460 --> 03:08:18.260]   but I don't know if they're aware they're doing it.
[03:08:18.260 --> 03:08:19.100]   - Oh yeah.
[03:08:19.100 --> 03:08:21.140]   - Which makes me also nervous about myself.
[03:08:21.140 --> 03:08:23.300]   Like am I doing frame control?
[03:08:23.300 --> 03:08:25.380]   - Yeah, that's one of the big things.
[03:08:25.380 --> 03:08:27.660]   It's like, typically people,
[03:08:27.660 --> 03:08:29.660]   you can't think about incentive.
[03:08:29.660 --> 03:08:30.500]   Like you can't think about,
[03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:32.220]   oh, is this person trying to do it or not?
[03:08:32.220 --> 03:08:33.060]   - Yeah.
[03:08:33.060 --> 03:08:33.940]   - That's like not the quite, not the way,
[03:08:33.940 --> 03:08:35.180]   you have to look at what are the effects.
[03:08:35.180 --> 03:08:36.780]   - Pragmatically looking at the effects.
[03:08:36.780 --> 03:08:38.780]   And then you also have to do that with yourself
[03:08:38.780 --> 03:08:40.780]   when you're having interactions with others.
[03:08:40.780 --> 03:08:42.500]   - It's like very much like, are you like,
[03:08:42.500 --> 03:08:43.900]   how much space are you making
[03:08:43.900 --> 03:08:46.060]   for the other person's reality here?
[03:08:46.060 --> 03:08:49.500]   Like, are you giving power to the other person?
[03:08:49.500 --> 03:08:50.860]   'Cause a big aspect of frame control
[03:08:50.860 --> 03:08:53.580]   is you're carefully rerouting the power to yourself.
[03:08:53.580 --> 03:08:55.740]   You're like, I am the person who knows.
[03:08:55.740 --> 03:08:57.700]   Like you're having pain in your beliefs
[03:08:57.700 --> 03:09:00.380]   because you're updating towards the things that I believe.
[03:09:00.380 --> 03:09:02.460]   Like it's just like a gravity well.
[03:09:02.460 --> 03:09:04.140]   But if you're setting up the gravity well
[03:09:04.140 --> 03:09:04.980]   of your interactions,
[03:09:04.980 --> 03:09:05.820]   such that you're making sure
[03:09:05.820 --> 03:09:07.580]   you're giving the other person power
[03:09:07.580 --> 03:09:09.260]   over the shared reality you inhabit,
[03:09:09.260 --> 03:09:10.100]   I think it's a really good sign
[03:09:10.100 --> 03:09:12.380]   that you're not doing frame control.
[03:09:12.380 --> 03:09:14.140]   - So if you're making room for them.
[03:09:14.140 --> 03:09:14.980]   - Yeah.
[03:09:14.980 --> 03:09:15.820]   - Okay.
[03:09:15.820 --> 03:09:17.300]   Unless we're talking about in bed,
[03:09:17.300 --> 03:09:20.540]   then it's all general relativity from there
[03:09:20.540 --> 03:09:21.380]   and black holes and stuff.
[03:09:21.380 --> 03:09:23.100]   - Frame control, bed frame control.
[03:09:23.100 --> 03:09:24.500]   Bed frame control.
[03:09:24.500 --> 03:09:27.900]   It took me a long time to get a bed frame.
[03:09:27.900 --> 03:09:28.900]   Just, I'm saying.
[03:09:28.900 --> 03:09:29.740]   - Wow.
[03:09:29.740 --> 03:09:31.060]   But you wear a suit though.
[03:09:31.060 --> 03:09:34.340]   - Yeah.
[03:09:34.340 --> 03:09:36.100]   So frame control in the streets,
[03:09:36.100 --> 03:09:37.580]   no frame in the sheets.
[03:09:37.580 --> 03:09:38.420]   I don't know.
[03:09:38.420 --> 03:09:39.900]   I don't know what the funny thing is to say there,
[03:09:39.900 --> 03:09:41.300]   but there you have it.
[03:09:41.300 --> 03:09:46.780]   So the LSD helped you escape the frame of,
[03:09:46.780 --> 03:09:51.900]   can you like elaborate what was the frame that was,
[03:09:52.900 --> 03:09:57.900]   holding you back from,
[03:09:57.900 --> 03:10:00.300]   like the frame constructed by your childhood experience
[03:10:00.300 --> 03:10:02.820]   that was holding you back as an intellectual,
[03:10:02.820 --> 03:10:05.100]   as a thinker, as a free being in this world?
[03:10:05.100 --> 03:10:07.820]   - Well, I was really fucked up.
[03:10:07.820 --> 03:10:09.860]   Like after I left home and I absorbed
[03:10:09.860 --> 03:10:12.220]   the external narrative that I had been abused,
[03:10:12.220 --> 03:10:13.500]   which technically is true.
[03:10:13.500 --> 03:10:15.980]   I'm not saying I wasn't, but like I absorbed this narrative
[03:10:15.980 --> 03:10:18.780]   and I just remember having like this burning coals
[03:10:18.780 --> 03:10:19.900]   in my chest at all times.
[03:10:19.900 --> 03:10:22.580]   Like if I had to call out of my factory work
[03:10:22.580 --> 03:10:23.580]   when Father's Day happened,
[03:10:23.580 --> 03:10:24.900]   because I was spending the whole day sobbing
[03:10:24.900 --> 03:10:26.820]   'cause everybody's talking about their fathers.
[03:10:26.820 --> 03:10:28.660]   Like I was really messed up.
[03:10:28.660 --> 03:10:30.700]   And it's because I held this important thing,
[03:10:30.700 --> 03:10:34.780]   this idea, this frame, that I had been deeply wronged.
[03:10:34.780 --> 03:10:36.900]   Like there was a correct way of being
[03:10:36.900 --> 03:10:38.580]   and the world had violated that.
[03:10:38.580 --> 03:10:40.460]   Something should not have happened.
[03:10:40.460 --> 03:10:42.500]   Like my father should have loved me.
[03:10:42.500 --> 03:10:43.540]   And it was like this,
[03:10:43.540 --> 03:10:47.220]   like the shearing in the nature of reality.
[03:10:47.220 --> 03:10:49.660]   And that was really agonizing to have.
[03:10:49.660 --> 03:10:53.180]   And LSD really messes with frames a lot.
[03:10:53.180 --> 03:10:54.500]   It takes like what you think is normal
[03:10:54.500 --> 03:10:55.620]   and really screws with it.
[03:10:55.620 --> 03:10:57.500]   And I'd done LSD like several times before,
[03:10:57.500 --> 03:11:01.020]   but there's one LSD trip where I went through
[03:11:01.020 --> 03:11:02.340]   my entire childhood in my head.
[03:11:02.340 --> 03:11:05.500]   'Cause LSD like really makes your memories quite vivid.
[03:11:05.500 --> 03:11:07.540]   Like anything you visualize, it's like you're in it.
[03:11:07.540 --> 03:11:09.300]   And so I just went and very carefully,
[03:11:09.300 --> 03:11:11.580]   deliberately went and remembered every single memory
[03:11:11.580 --> 03:11:14.220]   that I could have that was really painful for me.
[03:11:14.220 --> 03:11:16.620]   Like the times that I lost friends
[03:11:16.620 --> 03:11:19.020]   and all the things I valued and like being broken,
[03:11:19.020 --> 03:11:20.740]   'cause like my parents, especially my dad,
[03:11:20.740 --> 03:11:22.860]   would refer to like breaking me, like explicitly,
[03:11:22.860 --> 03:11:24.060]   we're going to break your will.
[03:11:24.060 --> 03:11:25.300]   And so all these times where I was like,
[03:11:25.300 --> 03:11:27.500]   they had successfully broken my will over and over.
[03:11:27.500 --> 03:11:28.460]   And it was horrible.
[03:11:28.460 --> 03:11:32.100]   I was just like sobbing, tears streaming down my face.
[03:11:32.100 --> 03:11:34.500]   And then I like worked through my whole childhood.
[03:11:34.500 --> 03:11:36.900]   I got to the end and I'm going to tear up
[03:11:36.900 --> 03:11:37.740]   because every time I talk about this,
[03:11:37.740 --> 03:11:42.380]   it's just like the sensation of like being free from that
[03:11:42.380 --> 03:11:46.180]   for the first time is so incredible.
[03:11:46.180 --> 03:11:48.740]   Like I remember being outside of my house
[03:11:48.740 --> 03:11:52.780]   and being able to like go where I wanted
[03:11:52.780 --> 03:11:54.020]   and think what I wanted.
[03:11:54.020 --> 03:11:57.820]   And it was just so blissful.
[03:11:57.820 --> 03:12:01.900]   And I was soaked in this gratitude on this trip,
[03:12:01.900 --> 03:12:06.220]   just like vibrating with complete joy for everything.
[03:12:06.220 --> 03:12:07.900]   Like I was just looking around, like I could touch anything.
[03:12:07.900 --> 03:12:09.860]   Like I could cry if I wanted to.
[03:12:09.860 --> 03:12:11.100]   I wasn't allowed to cry.
[03:12:11.100 --> 03:12:11.980]   I was not to be depressed.
[03:12:11.980 --> 03:12:13.900]   I was trying to, I got depressed as a child.
[03:12:13.900 --> 03:12:15.740]   And my parents were like, if you keep being depressed,
[03:12:15.740 --> 03:12:18.060]   we're going to like force you to scrub the whole house.
[03:12:18.060 --> 03:12:20.660]   Like just like the ability to have a feeling
[03:12:20.660 --> 03:12:23.820]   was so thrilling.
[03:12:23.820 --> 03:12:25.140]   And I was so grateful for this.
[03:12:25.140 --> 03:12:26.140]   I was like, I would do anything
[03:12:26.140 --> 03:12:27.660]   to give this experience to someone else.
[03:12:27.660 --> 03:12:29.380]   I would do anything,
[03:12:29.380 --> 03:12:31.620]   even if it was like putting them through what I went through.
[03:12:31.620 --> 03:12:33.780]   And then like with that realization, I was like,
[03:12:33.780 --> 03:12:35.060]   oh, it was worth it.
[03:12:35.060 --> 03:12:36.980]   The thing that I went through was worth it for this.
[03:12:36.980 --> 03:12:39.740]   I would do it again to like be able to have
[03:12:39.740 --> 03:12:42.660]   this deep gratitude for what I have now.
[03:12:42.660 --> 03:12:45.060]   And then that shifted the meaning frame
[03:12:45.060 --> 03:12:46.780]   because before the meaning had been like something
[03:12:46.780 --> 03:12:48.940]   that's shared, something that shouldn't have happened.
[03:12:48.940 --> 03:12:51.260]   But now it was like the exact right thing had happened.
[03:12:51.260 --> 03:12:52.460]   - So it's almost a gift.
[03:12:52.460 --> 03:12:53.300]   - Yeah.
[03:12:53.300 --> 03:12:55.860]   I was like, ah, I would not give up my childhood.
[03:12:55.860 --> 03:12:57.220]   I would do it again.
[03:12:57.220 --> 03:12:58.460]   And I believe that to this day.
[03:12:58.460 --> 03:13:00.900]   - For the moment of discovering that freedom.
[03:13:00.900 --> 03:13:02.420]   - Yeah.
[03:13:02.420 --> 03:13:03.900]   'Cause like everything now,
[03:13:03.900 --> 03:13:06.580]   my whole life is in contrast to that.
[03:13:06.580 --> 03:13:07.420]   And it's awesome.
[03:13:07.420 --> 03:13:09.140]   It's fucking great.
[03:13:09.140 --> 03:13:10.580]   I'm really thrilled about it.
[03:13:10.580 --> 03:13:16.220]   - Is there a part of you that hates your father still?
[03:13:17.020 --> 03:13:19.420]   - Kind of, like I don't want a relationship with anymore.
[03:13:19.420 --> 03:13:21.060]   After that, there was some forgiveness.
[03:13:21.060 --> 03:13:22.420]   Like I had this burning,
[03:13:22.420 --> 03:13:25.020]   I would have nightmares about him killing me or something.
[03:13:25.020 --> 03:13:26.380]   And after that, it kind of stopped.
[03:13:26.380 --> 03:13:28.900]   Like the fire in my chest went away permanently
[03:13:28.900 --> 03:13:29.740]   after that trip.
[03:13:29.740 --> 03:13:30.580]   It was so fast.
[03:13:30.580 --> 03:13:31.740]   It was like before I was fucked up,
[03:13:31.740 --> 03:13:35.060]   after that trip, I woke up the next day and I was clean.
[03:13:35.060 --> 03:13:37.180]   It was really severe.
[03:13:37.180 --> 03:13:40.420]   And I definitely don't want to be around him still.
[03:13:40.420 --> 03:13:42.700]   Like he still like triggers the fear in my body,
[03:13:42.700 --> 03:13:44.700]   but I don't have that hang up anymore.
[03:13:44.700 --> 03:13:45.940]   I'm like kind of, I'm over it.
[03:13:45.940 --> 03:13:47.140]   Like I've let go.
[03:13:47.140 --> 03:13:48.580]   He's his own person.
[03:13:48.580 --> 03:13:51.180]   Like ultimately he didn't get to decide who he was
[03:13:51.180 --> 03:13:53.900]   in the same way that I didn't get to decide who I was.
[03:13:53.900 --> 03:13:55.500]   - So that's almost like a kind of,
[03:13:55.500 --> 03:13:58.500]   at least intellectual, like forgiveness you have for him.
[03:13:58.500 --> 03:13:59.340]   - Yeah.
[03:13:59.340 --> 03:14:06.980]   - And that, so that trip just took you through your whole,
[03:14:06.980 --> 03:14:09.540]   were you alone by the way, when you're doing the trip?
[03:14:09.540 --> 03:14:11.980]   - Yeah, I had roommates, but the trip was mostly alone.
[03:14:11.980 --> 03:14:13.380]   I had somebody else who was like sitting in the room,
[03:14:13.380 --> 03:14:15.020]   but they weren't interacting with me.
[03:14:15.020 --> 03:14:17.980]   - So you're sitting there experiencing all of this.
[03:14:17.980 --> 03:14:18.820]   What's the timeline?
[03:14:18.820 --> 03:14:21.940]   Like how long does it take to go through your whole childhood?
[03:14:21.940 --> 03:14:22.780]   - I don't remember.
[03:14:22.780 --> 03:14:25.500]   I mean, time's really messed up when you do that.
[03:14:25.500 --> 03:14:27.140]   I was listening to the soundtrack of "The Fountain,"
[03:14:27.140 --> 03:14:28.140]   which is excellent.
[03:14:28.140 --> 03:14:28.980]   - Yeah.
[03:14:28.980 --> 03:14:31.300]   - I listened to that a lot when I did LSD.
[03:14:31.300 --> 03:14:33.460]   I don't know, it was probably a couple hours.
[03:14:33.460 --> 03:14:35.180]   - That's amazing.
[03:14:35.180 --> 03:14:37.380]   I mean, it's like, it would be,
[03:14:37.380 --> 03:14:41.540]   it's just like a vivid experience of your childhood.
[03:14:41.540 --> 03:14:43.500]   Moment by moment, trauma by trauma.
[03:14:44.380 --> 03:14:45.940]   And it's good to experience it purely.
[03:14:45.940 --> 03:14:47.100]   Like it just is what it is.
[03:14:47.100 --> 03:14:48.300]   It's just is grief.
[03:14:48.300 --> 03:14:52.340]   Like it is loss and you just are in it
[03:14:52.340 --> 03:14:54.800]   without having to make it be anything.
[03:14:54.800 --> 03:14:59.500]   - And it's so interesting that you can,
[03:14:59.500 --> 03:15:00.660]   I mean, work through that.
[03:15:00.660 --> 03:15:03.420]   So for a lot of us, for a lot of human beings,
[03:15:03.420 --> 03:15:08.220]   like childhood is full of those kind of mini traumas,
[03:15:08.220 --> 03:15:09.420]   big or small.
[03:15:09.420 --> 03:15:11.020]   And like working through that,
[03:15:11.020 --> 03:15:12.780]   it feels like what a lot of life is about
[03:15:12.780 --> 03:15:14.900]   is trying to work through that.
[03:15:14.900 --> 03:15:17.420]   And it feels like you have to kind of relive it.
[03:15:17.420 --> 03:15:19.860]   I guess that's what therapy is about on part,
[03:15:19.860 --> 03:15:20.860]   be able to vocalize it.
[03:15:20.860 --> 03:15:21.700]   - Yeah.
[03:15:21.700 --> 03:15:23.780]   This is why I feel really confused
[03:15:23.780 --> 03:15:24.940]   about the concept of trauma.
[03:15:24.940 --> 03:15:27.340]   Like people use this word so much, like, are you traumatized?
[03:15:27.340 --> 03:15:30.260]   And I understand why, like this is why I feel confused
[03:15:30.260 --> 03:15:31.280]   about it, but part of me is like,
[03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:32.580]   I wonder if by using that term,
[03:15:32.580 --> 03:15:34.700]   we're creating the trauma in people.
[03:15:34.700 --> 03:15:36.340]   They were using the frame where the thing that happened
[03:15:36.340 --> 03:15:38.020]   to you was not supposed to happen.
[03:15:38.020 --> 03:15:38.860]   - Yeah.
[03:15:38.860 --> 03:15:40.740]   Yeah, maybe there needs to be a different frame.
[03:15:40.740 --> 03:15:42.100]   No, I agree with you totally.
[03:15:42.100 --> 03:15:45.820]   I've made friends with and talked to this guy
[03:15:45.820 --> 03:15:47.700]   named Paul Conti.
[03:15:47.700 --> 03:15:49.580]   He wrote a book on trauma.
[03:15:49.580 --> 03:15:52.060]   He's an incredible, brilliant psychiatrist.
[03:15:52.060 --> 03:15:54.060]   Yeah, he's probably agrees with you kind of.
[03:15:54.060 --> 03:15:54.900]   - Oh, that's cool.
[03:15:54.900 --> 03:15:55.720]   I should read it.
[03:15:55.720 --> 03:15:57.020]   - Yeah, you should.
[03:15:57.020 --> 03:15:57.860]   Maybe even talk to him.
[03:15:57.860 --> 03:15:59.460]   He's a fascinating human being.
[03:15:59.460 --> 03:16:02.020]   I'd be interested in the,
[03:16:02.020 --> 03:16:06.100]   a psychiatrist perspective is really interesting
[03:16:06.100 --> 03:16:10.340]   'cause you've been doing kind of an in-person survey
[03:16:11.300 --> 03:16:13.420]   'cause you've done so many patients.
[03:16:13.420 --> 03:16:14.260]   (Donna laughs)
[03:16:14.260 --> 03:16:18.620]   Like he's, like just talking to him is fascinating
[03:16:18.620 --> 03:16:21.820]   because like if I describe my experience
[03:16:21.820 --> 03:16:23.980]   or somebody else's experience,
[03:16:23.980 --> 03:16:27.300]   I could see his brain mapping it in interesting ways
[03:16:27.300 --> 03:16:30.760]   to the tens of thousands of like data points
[03:16:30.760 --> 03:16:31.660]   he has in his head.
[03:16:31.660 --> 03:16:34.560]   And it's like, of course that's what doctors do,
[03:16:34.560 --> 03:16:37.140]   but it's cool as the doctor is basically
[03:16:37.140 --> 03:16:38.940]   the doctor of the mind.
[03:16:38.940 --> 03:16:39.780]   And--
[03:16:39.780 --> 03:16:43.140]   - To have like an actual, like qualitative data.
[03:16:43.140 --> 03:16:44.100]   - And be able to, I mean,
[03:16:44.100 --> 03:16:45.900]   that's where the poetic stuff comes in.
[03:16:45.900 --> 03:16:47.140]   Ultimately as a psychiatrist,
[03:16:47.140 --> 03:16:49.460]   you're exploring the human mind
[03:16:49.460 --> 03:16:51.580]   with a bit of a sort of romantic element.
[03:16:51.580 --> 03:16:52.420]   - Yeah.
[03:16:52.420 --> 03:16:54.860]   - You can't be really systematic about it.
[03:16:54.860 --> 03:16:58.460]   But it does seem like frame or not,
[03:16:58.460 --> 03:17:02.060]   be able to just talk through the experiences you had
[03:17:02.060 --> 03:17:04.060]   is really powerful.
[03:17:04.060 --> 03:17:05.100]   - What about it is appealing?
[03:17:05.100 --> 03:17:08.380]   Is it just like being able to revisit it with new eyes?
[03:17:08.380 --> 03:17:09.220]   - No, I don't know exactly.
[03:17:09.220 --> 03:17:11.380]   It just seems to work for people.
[03:17:11.380 --> 03:17:12.740]   I don't know if it's appealing.
[03:17:12.740 --> 03:17:17.220]   It just seems like almost acknowledging to yourself
[03:17:17.220 --> 03:17:18.400]   that things happen.
[03:17:18.400 --> 03:17:22.740]   Like I've said, I think I've said this before.
[03:17:22.740 --> 03:17:24.420]   My brother, who I love very much,
[03:17:24.420 --> 03:17:26.980]   I tried to set me on fire a few times.
[03:17:26.980 --> 03:17:29.180]   And I think to me, it's funny,
[03:17:29.180 --> 03:17:31.780]   but I wonder if I didn't talk about it,
[03:17:31.780 --> 03:17:32.900]   like if that would be traumatic,
[03:17:32.900 --> 03:17:35.400]   maybe like talking and laughing about it.
[03:17:35.400 --> 03:17:37.220]   'Cause it was traumatic to me at the time.
[03:17:37.220 --> 03:17:38.060]   - I see.
[03:17:38.060 --> 03:17:38.900]   - I was like, I love you.
[03:17:38.900 --> 03:17:39.740]   I didn't even have fire,
[03:17:39.740 --> 03:17:41.700]   but it's what kids do when they're like young.
[03:17:41.700 --> 03:17:42.540]   - I love you.
[03:17:42.540 --> 03:17:43.380]   (both laughing)
[03:17:43.380 --> 03:17:46.180]   - I was like, whatever, it's what boys do.
[03:17:46.180 --> 03:17:47.980]   Like they're crazy.
[03:17:47.980 --> 03:17:51.260]   It makes total sense.
[03:17:51.260 --> 03:17:54.140]   It was probably funny from his perspective.
[03:17:54.140 --> 03:17:55.340]   But yeah, I wonder,
[03:17:55.340 --> 03:17:57.420]   I want to bring that to the surface of that, that helps.
[03:17:57.420 --> 03:18:00.340]   And maybe LSD allows you to,
[03:18:00.340 --> 03:18:02.220]   or different drugs, depending on the person,
[03:18:02.220 --> 03:18:05.140]   allows you to more vividly bring it to the surface.
[03:18:05.140 --> 03:18:07.580]   And then depending on your genetics,
[03:18:07.580 --> 03:18:09.260]   be able to find a better frame.
[03:18:09.260 --> 03:18:11.940]   That's fascinating.
[03:18:11.940 --> 03:18:13.700]   Human mind is freaking fascinating.
[03:18:13.700 --> 03:18:17.220]   All right.
[03:18:17.220 --> 03:18:20.340]   What's romantic to you, by the way?
[03:18:20.340 --> 03:18:23.300]   - I'm not a big romance person.
[03:18:23.300 --> 03:18:24.120]   What is?
[03:18:24.120 --> 03:18:26.020]   - So you're not like,
[03:18:26.020 --> 03:18:30.140]   so to you romantic is like objective analysis
[03:18:30.140 --> 03:18:32.500]   of the interactions between humans?
[03:18:32.500 --> 03:18:33.420]   - A little bit.
[03:18:33.420 --> 03:18:35.060]   Like I do find kind of the survey process
[03:18:35.060 --> 03:18:36.420]   that I did to be romantic.
[03:18:37.420 --> 03:18:40.020]   When I, the guy that I asked out who I'm still dating,
[03:18:40.020 --> 03:18:41.580]   I was like, hey, you scored really high on my survey.
[03:18:41.580 --> 03:18:43.860]   You want to like go eat food or something?
[03:18:43.860 --> 03:18:44.980]   And his response was like,
[03:18:44.980 --> 03:18:47.980]   you want to try doing three days in an Airbnb
[03:18:47.980 --> 03:18:48.820]   as our first date?
[03:18:48.820 --> 03:18:49.660]   And I was like, yeah.
[03:18:49.660 --> 03:18:51.060]   And that was romantic.
[03:18:51.060 --> 03:18:55.220]   Like the bold leap into a really intense date.
[03:18:55.220 --> 03:18:58.660]   - I think you mentioned something also,
[03:18:58.660 --> 03:19:02.700]   must've been a tweet or something like that,
[03:19:02.700 --> 03:19:07.700]   where if you, if people want you to show up to a thing,
[03:19:07.700 --> 03:19:13.540]   give like the time, the location, the dress code,
[03:19:13.540 --> 03:19:19.440]   and not, no pressure for you to be there,
[03:19:19.440 --> 03:19:20.900]   but like show up if you want.
[03:19:20.900 --> 03:19:23.100]   That was your specification.
[03:19:23.100 --> 03:19:24.260]   - It's a great memory, yeah.
[03:19:24.260 --> 03:19:26.180]   - And then I think you said that you did that
[03:19:26.180 --> 03:19:29.540]   for like some castle in South of France.
[03:19:29.540 --> 03:19:31.060]   - I did, yeah.
[03:19:31.060 --> 03:19:32.500]   That was in my early 20s.
[03:19:32.500 --> 03:19:34.940]   People, my friends at home were taking prediction markets
[03:19:34.940 --> 03:19:37.820]   on whether or not I was going to get abducted and killed.
[03:19:37.820 --> 03:19:38.700]   - Yeah, what was that like?
[03:19:38.700 --> 03:19:42.580]   I mean, what, you've traveled quite a bit.
[03:19:42.580 --> 03:19:44.500]   Like, do you take these giant risks?
[03:19:44.500 --> 03:19:45.340]   What's with that?
[03:19:45.340 --> 03:19:46.980]   - I think I used to more when I was younger
[03:19:46.980 --> 03:19:47.820]   with the traveling.
[03:19:47.820 --> 03:19:48.980]   I think I'm like a little traveled out now,
[03:19:48.980 --> 03:19:50.580]   but like my first one,
[03:19:50.580 --> 03:19:51.660]   I moved out of Idaho for the first time.
[03:19:51.660 --> 03:19:52.980]   I moved to Australia.
[03:19:52.980 --> 03:19:55.700]   Just kind of yeeted myself across the globe.
[03:19:55.700 --> 03:19:57.580]   - Which verb did you just use?
[03:19:57.580 --> 03:19:58.420]   - Yeah, yeet.
[03:19:59.260 --> 03:20:02.820]   It's like yeet to yote, yatted, yeet.
[03:20:02.820 --> 03:20:05.580]   - So do people, is this like slang?
[03:20:05.580 --> 03:20:06.860]   Is this like urban dictionary?
[03:20:06.860 --> 03:20:08.380]   Is this actual or is this webster?
[03:20:08.380 --> 03:20:09.580]   - Yeah, you have to like feel into the word.
[03:20:09.580 --> 03:20:10.420]   Like if you take a thing
[03:20:10.420 --> 03:20:12.740]   and you just like curl it really hard,
[03:20:12.740 --> 03:20:15.620]   does it not feel like a yeet motion?
[03:20:15.620 --> 03:20:16.980]   - Okay, so you yeeted.
[03:20:16.980 --> 03:20:18.420]   So it was aggressive.
[03:20:18.420 --> 03:20:22.740]   So across the globe, you didn't even stop in-
[03:20:22.740 --> 03:20:24.060]   - I just hurled myself, yeah.
[03:20:24.060 --> 03:20:24.900]   - Italy along the way.
[03:20:24.900 --> 03:20:27.220]   - I just kept yeeting myself in various places, yeah.
[03:20:27.220 --> 03:20:28.980]   And so at one point I was on OkCupid
[03:20:28.980 --> 03:20:30.260]   and somebody sent me a long message
[03:20:30.260 --> 03:20:31.780]   being like, "You should come to,"
[03:20:31.780 --> 03:20:33.460]   I don't know, I'm hosting a castle.
[03:20:33.460 --> 03:20:35.940]   It's some people that I met.
[03:20:35.940 --> 03:20:36.980]   I'm like, "I have no idea who you are,
[03:20:36.980 --> 03:20:38.820]   but I just bought a plane ticket."
[03:20:38.820 --> 03:20:39.660]   - And you just went.
[03:20:39.660 --> 03:20:40.620]   - And it was life-changing.
[03:20:40.620 --> 03:20:42.460]   I ended up dating that guy for years
[03:20:42.460 --> 03:20:44.380]   and he changed my life quite a bit
[03:20:44.380 --> 03:20:46.340]   'cause he like was very agency in the world.
[03:20:46.340 --> 03:20:48.580]   And before that, I wasn't agency.
[03:20:48.580 --> 03:20:51.940]   - Agency, like, can we-
[03:20:51.940 --> 03:20:52.780]   - So expressing agency.
[03:20:52.780 --> 03:20:54.340]   - It sounds like you were,
[03:20:54.340 --> 03:20:56.020]   and don't you have to express agency
[03:20:56.020 --> 03:20:58.180]   when you're yeeting yourself across the world?
[03:20:58.180 --> 03:20:59.420]   - Yeah, but only a little bit.
[03:20:59.420 --> 03:21:01.700]   Like in the same way you express agency when you eat LSD,
[03:21:01.700 --> 03:21:03.820]   like the only thing you actually do in eating LSD
[03:21:03.820 --> 03:21:05.420]   is like put the tab in your mouth
[03:21:05.420 --> 03:21:08.900]   and then you just kind of scream the whole way after that.
[03:21:08.900 --> 03:21:10.820]   But there are a lot of other things,
[03:21:10.820 --> 03:21:12.420]   like I didn't feel powerful enough
[03:21:12.420 --> 03:21:15.940]   to like go make events happen or anything.
[03:21:15.940 --> 03:21:19.860]   And it was this guy, he had a lot of agency
[03:21:19.860 --> 03:21:22.140]   in the sense that he would just sort of create realities
[03:21:22.140 --> 03:21:23.460]   through the people around him.
[03:21:23.460 --> 03:21:24.900]   Be like, "Okay, we're gonna do this startup
[03:21:24.900 --> 03:21:26.540]   or we're going to throw this incredible event.
[03:21:26.540 --> 03:21:27.500]   Like, let's just do it."
[03:21:27.500 --> 03:21:28.660]   And it would somehow happen.
[03:21:28.660 --> 03:21:30.420]   And it was really cool to see that.
[03:21:30.420 --> 03:21:33.020]   And so that one thing led to another
[03:21:33.020 --> 03:21:36.580]   and it was one of the biggest impacts on my life, I think.
[03:21:36.580 --> 03:21:38.100]   - Yeah, that's pretty bold.
[03:21:38.100 --> 03:21:39.740]   I would say it's pretty romantic.
[03:21:39.740 --> 03:21:40.700]   South of France?
[03:21:40.700 --> 03:21:41.820]   - Yeah, yeah, it was.
[03:21:41.820 --> 03:21:43.220]   In a little castle, it was in the winter.
[03:21:43.220 --> 03:21:45.220]   So we were all coaxed out by the fire.
[03:21:45.220 --> 03:21:49.500]   - I'm jumping around here.
[03:21:49.500 --> 03:21:53.220]   Twitter poll, have you ever hitchhiked?
[03:21:53.220 --> 03:21:54.980]   You posted this Twitter poll.
[03:21:54.980 --> 03:21:56.860]   - Out of all, that was a big list of Twitter polls.
[03:21:56.860 --> 03:21:58.340]   Why did you pick the hitchhiking one?
[03:21:58.340 --> 03:22:01.860]   - I don't know, 'cause it's relevant to traveling.
[03:22:01.860 --> 03:22:03.340]   And I like that one.
[03:22:03.340 --> 03:22:04.940]   That's romantic too, right?
[03:22:04.940 --> 03:22:06.100]   - I'm actually terrified of hitchhiking,
[03:22:06.100 --> 03:22:07.660]   but I have done it a little bit.
[03:22:07.660 --> 03:22:09.740]   - Oh, so it's terrifying, it's not romantic to you.
[03:22:09.740 --> 03:22:10.900]   So you're terrified of what?
[03:22:10.900 --> 03:22:11.740]   Oh, so you are terrified of-
[03:22:11.740 --> 03:22:14.460]   - Well, just interacting with strangers.
[03:22:14.460 --> 03:22:15.300]   - That's terrifying.
[03:22:15.300 --> 03:22:16.860]   - Yeah.
[03:22:16.860 --> 03:22:18.700]   - So you go to South of France.
[03:22:18.700 --> 03:22:21.180]   - Yeah.
[03:22:21.180 --> 03:22:23.420]   But that was like a cohesive thing, I don't know.
[03:22:23.420 --> 03:22:24.940]   - It made sense.
[03:22:24.940 --> 03:22:26.260]   - There's like times where you're allowed to be weird
[03:22:26.260 --> 03:22:27.820]   and times where you're not.
[03:22:27.820 --> 03:22:28.660]   And like if you're-
[03:22:28.660 --> 03:22:30.140]   - Who's allowing you?
[03:22:30.140 --> 03:22:32.100]   - Yeah, some vague-
[03:22:32.100 --> 03:22:33.140]   - A voice? - Igor of society,
[03:22:33.140 --> 03:22:33.980]   I'm not sure.
[03:22:33.980 --> 03:22:35.020]   - Okay.
[03:22:35.020 --> 03:22:36.620]   - But some people are like, "Hey, we think you're cool.
[03:22:36.620 --> 03:22:37.460]   "Come to this party."
[03:22:37.460 --> 03:22:38.860]   You're like, "All right, I'm allowed to come to this party
[03:22:38.860 --> 03:22:39.980]   "and be really weird."
[03:22:39.980 --> 03:22:41.980]   But if you're being picked up by a hitchhiker,
[03:22:41.980 --> 03:22:43.660]   they're gonna wanna make small talk and you can't be weird
[03:22:43.660 --> 03:22:45.300]   or they're gonna kick you out.
[03:22:45.300 --> 03:22:48.260]   - I kinda think, 'cause Valentine's Day is coming up,
[03:22:48.260 --> 03:22:51.420]   I'm kinda think it's doing something crazy, I'm not sure.
[03:22:51.420 --> 03:22:53.140]   South of France sounds nice.
[03:22:53.140 --> 03:22:55.460]   - You gotta go to like a crazy romantic date
[03:22:55.460 --> 03:22:56.460]   with a woman you don't know at all.
[03:22:56.460 --> 03:22:58.740]   - Yeah, I think I'm gonna like tweet something
[03:22:58.740 --> 03:23:03.020]   and just like, how do I select randomly, basically?
[03:23:03.020 --> 03:23:04.540]   - How do you select totally randomly,
[03:23:04.540 --> 03:23:06.100]   like not people from your audience?
[03:23:06.100 --> 03:23:07.780]   - No, you want, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[03:23:07.780 --> 03:23:09.860]   from the audience, but in an interesting way,
[03:23:09.860 --> 03:23:13.700]   random, sufficient, so random amongst good choices.
[03:23:13.700 --> 03:23:17.140]   - Couldn't you have people just like submit a form
[03:23:17.140 --> 03:23:20.340]   and then you just randomize it and then select one?
[03:23:20.340 --> 03:23:21.780]   And then you just, if it's terrible,
[03:23:21.780 --> 03:23:23.780]   you just go randomize it again.
[03:23:23.780 --> 03:23:26.100]   Like the first not terrible option.
[03:23:26.100 --> 03:23:27.340]   - Yeah, sure.
[03:23:27.340 --> 03:23:28.420]   - Somebody's like drown yourself.
[03:23:28.420 --> 03:23:30.460]   - But I feel like then it's no longer random.
[03:23:30.460 --> 03:23:32.980]   You kinda wanna do random, you just do it
[03:23:32.980 --> 03:23:35.180]   and just do it, if I cross the world somewhere
[03:23:35.180 --> 03:23:38.900]   in some random place, just for like a single event,
[03:23:38.900 --> 03:23:39.820]   for like a dinner.
[03:23:39.820 --> 03:23:43.740]   - You got some sort of itch in you.
[03:23:43.740 --> 03:23:46.100]   - Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, the itch to live.
[03:23:46.100 --> 03:23:51.120]   Like sometimes it's nice to drop a little like chaos
[03:23:51.120 --> 03:23:52.020]   into a thing, right?
[03:23:52.020 --> 03:23:53.540]   What's your chaos survey, by the way?
[03:23:53.540 --> 03:23:54.940]   Like you mentioned that earlier.
[03:23:54.940 --> 03:23:55.780]   I kinda saw it.
[03:23:55.780 --> 03:23:58.020]   - Oh yeah, that's one of like the sort of artistic attempts
[03:23:58.020 --> 03:24:00.620]   at a survey, 'cause you know, like at least
[03:24:00.620 --> 03:24:02.340]   from what I understand, the big five and the way
[03:24:02.340 --> 03:24:03.980]   that they used to do IQ tests, I've heard,
[03:24:03.980 --> 03:24:05.660]   is that they do factor analysis, you know,
[03:24:05.660 --> 03:24:08.180]   where they ask a whole bunch of questions
[03:24:08.180 --> 03:24:09.860]   and then they run calculations on the data
[03:24:09.860 --> 03:24:12.060]   to like sort of group it by organic clusters.
[03:24:12.060 --> 03:24:13.740]   So like with the big five, it's like people who say,
[03:24:13.740 --> 03:24:14.900]   "Oh, I like to be at parties."
[03:24:14.900 --> 03:24:17.300]   They also tend to say yes to the questions like,
[03:24:17.300 --> 03:24:18.980]   "I like being the center of attention."
[03:24:18.980 --> 03:24:20.780]   And so you notice that like there's a cluster of ways
[03:24:20.780 --> 03:24:21.760]   that people are answering the question
[03:24:21.760 --> 03:24:24.860]   and then you can sort of pull out an organic spectrum.
[03:24:24.860 --> 03:24:27.380]   And so I was like, okay, we've done that a whole bunch
[03:24:27.380 --> 03:24:31.420]   with things like personality or like romantic stuff.
[03:24:31.420 --> 03:24:33.160]   Like I did it with the rape spectrum survey.
[03:24:33.160 --> 03:24:35.260]   But like what happens if you apply that method
[03:24:35.260 --> 03:24:37.860]   to a completely unselected group of questions?
[03:24:37.860 --> 03:24:41.820]   Just like no random chaotic, no thing whatsoever.
[03:24:41.820 --> 03:24:44.040]   Like what happens is if you ask all possible questions,
[03:24:44.040 --> 03:24:47.280]   what natural things evolve out of that natural spectrums?
[03:24:47.280 --> 03:24:48.980]   So I had other people submit questions
[03:24:48.980 --> 03:24:51.220]   for a very large survey and I took the first,
[03:24:51.220 --> 03:24:55.380]   I think 1100 and barely filtered them at all.
[03:24:55.380 --> 03:24:58.180]   And then I just had a whole bunch of people answer them.
[03:24:58.180 --> 03:24:59.020]   - Whoa.
[03:24:59.020 --> 03:24:59.860]   (laughs)
[03:24:59.860 --> 03:25:01.780]   Can you give like a hint to what it looks like?
[03:25:01.780 --> 03:25:04.820]   Like how crazy did the question get?
[03:25:04.820 --> 03:25:06.660]   - I mean, a lot of them were standard,
[03:25:06.660 --> 03:25:09.860]   but somebody was like, if Beelzebub like did something
[03:25:09.860 --> 03:25:14.620]   in 1512 to like turn the world over, would you like it?
[03:25:14.620 --> 03:25:15.460]   I don't know.
[03:25:15.460 --> 03:25:16.980]   I'd say it was really just insane questions.
[03:25:16.980 --> 03:25:18.500]   There's a couple of those.
[03:25:18.500 --> 03:25:20.420]   A lot of like, would you fuck Ayla ones,
[03:25:20.420 --> 03:25:21.860]   but I don't know.
[03:25:21.860 --> 03:25:22.700]   It was all across the spectrum.
[03:25:22.700 --> 03:25:23.740]   - A lot of would you fuck Ayla.
[03:25:23.740 --> 03:25:25.340]   - Yeah, I had to produce duplicate.
[03:25:25.340 --> 03:25:27.020]   - Oh, a lot of the same question.
[03:25:27.020 --> 03:25:28.180]   - Yeah.
[03:25:28.180 --> 03:25:29.740]   - Ones, okay, I got you.
[03:25:29.740 --> 03:25:33.260]   - Yeah, so it was like normal personal habits.
[03:25:33.260 --> 03:25:37.220]   It was romantic preferences or political preferences,
[03:25:37.220 --> 03:25:40.460]   personality stuff, like random opinions about media.
[03:25:40.460 --> 03:25:42.140]   - Okay, that's interesting.
[03:25:42.140 --> 03:25:44.700]   I'd love to see those actual questions,
[03:25:44.700 --> 03:25:46.060]   but because your audience is probably
[03:25:46.060 --> 03:25:47.920]   really super interesting minds.
[03:25:47.920 --> 03:25:49.580]   Okay, you mentioned body count.
[03:25:50.580 --> 03:25:54.380]   You said you can answer that one easily.
[03:25:54.380 --> 03:25:56.020]   Do you share your body count?
[03:25:56.020 --> 03:25:57.460]   Do you know your body count?
[03:25:57.460 --> 03:25:58.780]   Do you know, is there a spreadsheet?
[03:25:58.780 --> 03:26:00.260]   - There's a spreadsheet, yes.
[03:26:00.260 --> 03:26:01.140]   - Is it Google sheets?
[03:26:01.140 --> 03:26:02.740]   Is it Excel? - It's Google sheets, yeah.
[03:26:02.740 --> 03:26:06.500]   - Okay, have you run like, is there,
[03:26:06.500 --> 03:26:09.540]   you don't have to share the contents,
[03:26:09.540 --> 03:26:12.660]   but is there like data on each?
[03:26:12.660 --> 03:26:17.380]   - So I track paid clients and free sex separately,
[03:26:17.380 --> 03:26:19.620]   and I track different things on either of them.
[03:26:19.620 --> 03:26:21.380]   Like with clients, I track like positions we used
[03:26:21.380 --> 03:26:23.020]   and who had an orgasm.
[03:26:23.020 --> 03:26:25.660]   And with personal people, I just track basically like
[03:26:25.660 --> 03:26:29.080]   age, city, you know, name.
[03:26:29.080 --> 03:26:32.660]   And I've had this with I think 42 people, I think, for free.
[03:26:32.660 --> 03:26:35.540]   So I'm sharing this because I want people to calibrate.
[03:26:35.540 --> 03:26:38.340]   Like it's not like huge, it's not like tiny.
[03:26:38.340 --> 03:26:42.020]   - One of the people I've recently talked to, Mel,
[03:26:42.020 --> 03:26:47.020]   Destiny's, Stephen's wife is a huge fan of yours.
[03:26:47.020 --> 03:26:49.340]   She was actually really excited to get to talk to you.
[03:26:49.340 --> 03:26:52.940]   But I think she said her body count is more than 42.
[03:26:52.940 --> 03:26:55.660]   I think she said 60, something like this.
[03:26:55.660 --> 03:27:00.220]   And so it's interesting, 'cause she was like saying like,
[03:27:00.220 --> 03:27:05.140]   she loves like looking at your work, talking to you,
[03:27:05.140 --> 03:27:08.940]   because you have similar perspectives on the world,
[03:27:08.940 --> 03:27:11.140]   and it's really refreshing, it's liberating.
[03:27:11.140 --> 03:27:12.900]   Wow.
[03:27:12.900 --> 03:27:14.140]   - That was really sweet.
[03:27:14.140 --> 03:27:15.340]   - It's kind of interesting.
[03:27:15.860 --> 03:27:18.060]   Is there like an optimal body count?
[03:27:18.060 --> 03:27:20.180]   If you were to map, I wonder,
[03:27:20.180 --> 03:27:23.700]   what have you found out about body count in doing?
[03:27:23.700 --> 03:27:25.580]   Have you actually done surveys on body count?
[03:27:25.580 --> 03:27:26.940]   Like on how many people you've had sex with?
[03:27:26.940 --> 03:27:29.420]   - I have collected that information on my last survey.
[03:27:29.420 --> 03:27:30.340]   I just haven't looked at it yet.
[03:27:30.340 --> 03:27:32.660]   There's just so many things to look at, so I haven't.
[03:27:32.660 --> 03:27:34.580]   But I think if I'm sleeping with a guy
[03:27:34.580 --> 03:27:36.780]   and he's had sex with more than 120 people,
[03:27:36.780 --> 03:27:39.300]   then I start to get a little bit wary.
[03:27:39.300 --> 03:27:41.540]   - Why 120 as opposed to 100?
[03:27:41.540 --> 03:27:43.100]   - I don't know.
[03:27:43.100 --> 03:27:44.740]   I just like kind of skimmed through the numbers
[03:27:44.740 --> 03:27:47.060]   in my head and picked one that felt right.
[03:27:47.060 --> 03:27:47.900]   - Just now?
[03:27:47.900 --> 03:27:48.740]   - Yeah.
[03:27:48.740 --> 03:27:49.560]   - 120?
[03:27:49.560 --> 03:27:50.400]   - Ish.
[03:27:50.400 --> 03:27:51.900]   I think that's when I'm starting like--
[03:27:51.900 --> 03:27:53.540]   - Ish, so you're flexible.
[03:27:53.540 --> 03:27:54.940]   - Yeah, I'm flexible, very.
[03:27:54.940 --> 03:27:57.600]   (both laughing)
[03:27:57.600 --> 03:28:02.220]   - But 200 is a hard line for sure.
[03:28:02.220 --> 03:28:03.860]   - Well, so you know, we have to--
[03:28:03.860 --> 03:28:05.660]   - Depends, the factors.
[03:28:05.660 --> 03:28:07.900]   - 'Cause there's a level of body count
[03:28:07.900 --> 03:28:11.780]   at which you start to wonder how much
[03:28:11.780 --> 03:28:15.100]   accidental misrepresentation a guy is doing to you.
[03:28:15.100 --> 03:28:18.100]   - Oh, like if you're saying 200, that might be dishonest.
[03:28:18.100 --> 03:28:20.860]   - No, like if he's had sex with 200 girls,
[03:28:20.860 --> 03:28:23.260]   this means that he's had a lot of casual sex
[03:28:23.260 --> 03:28:25.260]   and not a lot of long-term relationships,
[03:28:25.260 --> 03:28:28.060]   assuming that he hasn't been super poly.
[03:28:28.060 --> 03:28:29.580]   And this usually means that there has to be
[03:28:29.580 --> 03:28:32.540]   some sort of indication that he cares about the girl
[03:28:32.540 --> 03:28:33.900]   more than he actually does.
[03:28:33.900 --> 03:28:38.220]   Like he's like leading you on, basically.
[03:28:38.220 --> 03:28:40.420]   And so I'm not saying this is necessarily the case.
[03:28:40.420 --> 03:28:42.100]   I'm saying like at a certain level of number,
[03:28:42.100 --> 03:28:45.500]   I start to wonder if this is what's happening.
[03:28:45.500 --> 03:28:47.860]   - Is there like, from your understanding of it,
[03:28:47.860 --> 03:28:49.780]   is there a different perception between men and women?
[03:28:49.780 --> 03:28:52.140]   Like if you look at the high body count for a woman
[03:28:52.140 --> 03:28:54.220]   versus a high body count for a man,
[03:28:54.220 --> 03:28:55.940]   like how society views it?
[03:28:55.940 --> 03:28:59.180]   - Oh yeah, people are way more judgmental of women.
[03:28:59.180 --> 03:29:01.820]   I haven't experienced this personally in my circles
[03:29:01.820 --> 03:29:03.380]   'cause I'm in very sex-friendly circles.
[03:29:03.380 --> 03:29:05.660]   Like I'm in orgy circles where everybody
[03:29:05.660 --> 03:29:06.740]   dates the same women and they're like,
[03:29:06.740 --> 03:29:07.740]   "Woo, good job."
[03:29:08.700 --> 03:29:10.980]   But yeah, people are much more,
[03:29:10.980 --> 03:29:12.460]   like people always tell me online,
[03:29:12.460 --> 03:29:14.580]   like you're not ever gonna be able to find a husband
[03:29:14.580 --> 03:29:17.140]   because you have sex with too many people.
[03:29:17.140 --> 03:29:19.420]   It's very common, which I don't think,
[03:29:19.420 --> 03:29:21.260]   I mean like men are also perceived negatively
[03:29:21.260 --> 03:29:22.260]   if you have high body count,
[03:29:22.260 --> 03:29:24.460]   but I don't think it's negatively in the same way.
[03:29:24.460 --> 03:29:26.060]   - Yeah, do you think it's unethical
[03:29:26.060 --> 03:29:27.940]   to lie about your body count?
[03:29:27.940 --> 03:29:30.540]   - Yes.
[03:29:30.540 --> 03:29:32.260]   - So all lying is unethical?
[03:29:32.260 --> 03:29:34.420]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[03:29:34.420 --> 03:29:37.020]   I'm not a big fan of lying in general.
[03:29:37.020 --> 03:29:38.860]   - Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.
[03:29:38.860 --> 03:29:40.220]   Body count's an interesting one.
[03:29:40.220 --> 03:29:43.100]   It's so silly to take that, to care about that.
[03:29:43.100 --> 03:29:44.420]   But still we do.
[03:29:44.420 --> 03:29:47.660]   And jealousy is silly, but still we get jealous.
[03:29:47.660 --> 03:29:48.500]   Is that weird?
[03:29:48.500 --> 03:29:52.020]   - The thing is, I don't like viewing emotions
[03:29:52.020 --> 03:29:55.180]   as irrational, even if they are.
[03:29:55.180 --> 03:29:57.620]   It's like emotions are always there for a reason.
[03:29:57.620 --> 03:30:00.260]   And people don't like high body counts for a reason too.
[03:30:00.260 --> 03:30:01.740]   It's just fine and valid.
[03:30:01.740 --> 03:30:02.940]   - Yeah, it also is like,
[03:30:05.020 --> 03:30:08.500]   yeah, I don't know what I make of just the past,
[03:30:08.500 --> 03:30:10.100]   of like time.
[03:30:10.100 --> 03:30:13.260]   You know?
[03:30:13.260 --> 03:30:18.260]   Like, each human is a collection of experiences.
[03:30:18.260 --> 03:30:22.580]   And you don't know most of those experiences,
[03:30:22.580 --> 03:30:25.820]   and all of a sudden you meet this bag of experiences.
[03:30:25.820 --> 03:30:27.860]   And like, what are you supposed to do
[03:30:27.860 --> 03:30:30.120]   with both of your training data?
[03:30:30.120 --> 03:30:33.180]   Are you supposed to like, like what?
[03:30:34.220 --> 03:30:35.740]   Like, I don't know if we,
[03:30:35.740 --> 03:30:39.780]   like part of me wants to not actually ever talk about it,
[03:30:39.780 --> 03:30:41.020]   to care at all.
[03:30:41.020 --> 03:30:41.860]   Like, why does it matter?
[03:30:41.860 --> 03:30:43.980]   'Cause it's only the future that matters.
[03:30:43.980 --> 03:30:47.420]   And yet the past also matters a lot, potentially.
[03:30:47.420 --> 03:30:48.540]   But maybe not really.
[03:30:48.540 --> 03:30:53.540]   'Cause you're somehow like, constructed from that past,
[03:30:53.540 --> 03:30:56.260]   but you're no longer that past.
[03:30:56.260 --> 03:30:57.300]   - It sounds like you're evaluating
[03:30:57.300 --> 03:30:59.580]   for something different than most people.
[03:30:59.580 --> 03:31:00.420]   - What do you mean?
[03:31:00.420 --> 03:31:01.740]   - Like, the reason--
[03:31:01.740 --> 03:31:03.660]   - I'm just talking out my ass, but yes, go ahead.
[03:31:03.660 --> 03:31:05.620]   - Yeah, I'm just saying crazy shit,
[03:31:05.620 --> 03:31:07.220]   like as if I'm on drugs, but I'm not.
[03:31:07.220 --> 03:31:08.340]   - Well, it kind of sounds,
[03:31:08.340 --> 03:31:09.820]   I think this is like, kind of like lining up
[03:31:09.820 --> 03:31:12.140]   with like this caricature that I'm building of you,
[03:31:12.140 --> 03:31:13.940]   based on this conversation so far.
[03:31:13.940 --> 03:31:14.780]   - Great.
[03:31:14.780 --> 03:31:18.620]   - Like, a lot of people want to know about your past
[03:31:18.620 --> 03:31:20.400]   because they want to know how useful
[03:31:20.400 --> 03:31:21.660]   and compatible you are with them.
[03:31:21.660 --> 03:31:23.260]   Like, oh, do you have a similar job?
[03:31:23.260 --> 03:31:25.260]   You know, do you have a similar culture?
[03:31:25.260 --> 03:31:27.020]   Like, what can I expect from you in the future?
[03:31:27.020 --> 03:31:28.780]   Like, it's very practically oriented.
[03:31:28.780 --> 03:31:31.060]   Whereas like, if the thing that you're focused on
[03:31:31.060 --> 03:31:34.580]   is not like, being able to predict someone,
[03:31:34.580 --> 03:31:35.660]   like if the thing that you're focused on
[03:31:35.660 --> 03:31:36.500]   is the present moment,
[03:31:36.500 --> 03:31:38.220]   then it doesn't really matter anymore.
[03:31:38.220 --> 03:31:41.860]   They're the things that, like they're training data.
[03:31:41.860 --> 03:31:43.740]   - But I also think that the past
[03:31:43.740 --> 03:31:45.500]   is not that predictive of the future.
[03:31:45.500 --> 03:31:46.780]   - Is it not?
[03:31:46.780 --> 03:31:49.180]   - Not if you believe in the power of the interaction
[03:31:49.180 --> 03:31:50.620]   between two humans.
[03:31:50.620 --> 03:31:51.780]   It's like nature versus nurture.
[03:31:51.780 --> 03:31:56.460]   I guess, also I don't believe in the ability of people
[03:31:56.460 --> 03:31:59.060]   to accurately describe their own past.
[03:31:59.060 --> 03:31:59.900]   - This is true.
[03:31:59.900 --> 03:32:01.500]   - There's a very specific lens through it
[03:32:01.500 --> 03:32:04.180]   that doesn't necessarily, like it's too biased.
[03:32:04.180 --> 03:32:06.020]   - But you can also interpret based on the bias.
[03:32:06.020 --> 03:32:07.260]   Like if somebody describes their own past,
[03:32:07.260 --> 03:32:08.700]   you can kind of pick up like-
[03:32:08.700 --> 03:32:09.980]   - Hard, it's difficult.
[03:32:09.980 --> 03:32:11.700]   Like you could, if you're a therapist,
[03:32:11.700 --> 03:32:15.740]   like if you're really drilling, like, or whatever, sorry.
[03:32:15.740 --> 03:32:18.900]   If you're really investigating and like analyzing it,
[03:32:18.900 --> 03:32:19.820]   but then it's like,
[03:32:19.820 --> 03:32:21.660]   it's a different kind of relationship, right?
[03:32:21.660 --> 03:32:22.500]   - Is it that hard though?
[03:32:22.500 --> 03:32:24.900]   Like if I'm with a guy and I'm considering dating him
[03:32:24.900 --> 03:32:26.820]   and I ask like, how did your past relationship set?
[03:32:26.820 --> 03:32:28.180]   And then if all of them are like,
[03:32:28.180 --> 03:32:29.420]   he's like, oh, she was crazy.
[03:32:29.420 --> 03:32:31.180]   And my other one that she went crazy too.
[03:32:31.180 --> 03:32:32.180]   I'm like, okay.
[03:32:32.180 --> 03:32:33.940]   Like there's a, if you're talking about all of your exes
[03:32:33.940 --> 03:32:35.060]   is insane, like-
[03:32:35.060 --> 03:32:36.940]   - But that's an easy level red flag.
[03:32:36.940 --> 03:32:41.940]   But I feel like the more that also it's possible
[03:32:41.940 --> 03:32:44.620]   that they were crazy and he's attracted to crazy people.
[03:32:44.620 --> 03:32:48.460]   So like, but I would say that's like easy level
[03:32:48.460 --> 03:32:51.700]   Mario Kart video game versus like Elden Ring.
[03:32:51.700 --> 03:32:56.700]   Like I think most people's past is like complicated.
[03:32:56.700 --> 03:32:58.020]   - That's a pretty good bird.
[03:32:58.020 --> 03:32:58.860]   No, you're right.
[03:32:58.860 --> 03:33:03.100]   I do agree that like, there's a level of obfuscation.
[03:33:03.100 --> 03:33:03.940]   Wow.
[03:33:03.940 --> 03:33:05.620]   That is hard to see through,
[03:33:05.620 --> 03:33:07.580]   but this is like still a little bit sometimes.
[03:33:07.580 --> 03:33:09.220]   - Well, I tend to like with people,
[03:33:09.220 --> 03:33:11.780]   I tend to, in general, just human interaction.
[03:33:11.780 --> 03:33:15.500]   I tend to not talk about their past very much
[03:33:15.500 --> 03:33:18.060]   because it allows you to focus on like,
[03:33:18.060 --> 03:33:19.980]   I feel like the past is kind of like talking
[03:33:19.980 --> 03:33:22.820]   about the weather is a crutch for me personally.
[03:33:22.820 --> 03:33:23.660]   - Very interesting.
[03:33:23.660 --> 03:33:25.740]   - Like as opposed to exploring the ideas in their mind.
[03:33:25.740 --> 03:33:26.660]   - Yeah, I see.
[03:33:26.660 --> 03:33:28.500]   Is it like, I get really annoyed when people
[03:33:28.500 --> 03:33:29.660]   quote philosophers when they're trying
[03:33:29.660 --> 03:33:30.740]   to talk about philosophy.
[03:33:30.740 --> 03:33:31.580]   - Yeah.
[03:33:31.580 --> 03:33:33.260]   - Is it like that?
[03:33:33.260 --> 03:33:35.500]   - A little, but that crutch is useful.
[03:33:35.500 --> 03:33:36.740]   And it's kind of sexy.
[03:33:36.740 --> 03:33:38.020]   Like it's kind of like cool.
[03:33:38.020 --> 03:33:40.460]   Like, because it's nice to quote,
[03:33:40.460 --> 03:33:44.260]   because like, because a good quote allows you
[03:33:44.260 --> 03:33:46.900]   to be cheesier than you otherwise would be.
[03:33:46.900 --> 03:33:49.020]   - Okay, well, if you're doing it to be cheesy, that's fine.
[03:33:49.020 --> 03:33:52.020]   - No, not cheesy, but not, no, no, not cheesy,
[03:33:52.020 --> 03:33:55.380]   but to be like, it allows you to say a simple,
[03:33:55.380 --> 03:33:57.420]   profound thing that we're too afraid to say
[03:33:57.420 --> 03:33:58.820]   with our own words.
[03:33:58.820 --> 03:34:02.300]   So like the quoting philosophers in that sense is,
[03:34:02.300 --> 03:34:04.020]   yeah, but it is still a crutch, yes.
[03:34:04.020 --> 03:34:07.100]   But I feel like the past is more like
[03:34:07.100 --> 03:34:09.340]   talking about your dreams.
[03:34:09.340 --> 03:34:14.340]   It just is not, it's a crutch that doesn't care,
[03:34:14.340 --> 03:34:16.740]   that doesn't empathize with the other person's experience
[03:34:16.740 --> 03:34:18.500]   of the conversation or the explanations.
[03:34:18.500 --> 03:34:20.380]   It doesn't really convey the--
[03:34:20.380 --> 03:34:22.060]   - They're not involved in your past.
[03:34:22.060 --> 03:34:23.020]   - Yeah.
[03:34:23.020 --> 03:34:24.380]   - So how do you feel about this conversation
[03:34:24.380 --> 03:34:26.220]   where you're asking me about my past
[03:34:26.220 --> 03:34:27.880]   and I talked about my past a lot?
[03:34:27.880 --> 03:34:35.340]   - Well, I'm okay asking about your past
[03:34:35.340 --> 03:34:40.180]   because you've really carefully thought
[03:34:40.180 --> 03:34:42.220]   about that aspect of it.
[03:34:42.220 --> 03:34:44.540]   And we didn't really talk about your past
[03:34:44.540 --> 03:34:46.740]   outside of the things you've written about
[03:34:46.740 --> 03:34:48.820]   and have really thought about.
[03:34:48.820 --> 03:34:49.700]   - I see.
[03:34:49.700 --> 03:34:52.260]   - Like there's, like with most conversation,
[03:34:52.260 --> 03:34:53.620]   you'll start talking about past stuff
[03:34:53.620 --> 03:34:56.340]   that's like the stuff that's actually bothering you.
[03:34:56.340 --> 03:34:58.500]   You still probably have not written a blog post about.
[03:34:58.500 --> 03:35:01.020]   All right, like there's probably still stuff
[03:35:01.020 --> 03:35:03.140]   like maybe it's more recent,
[03:35:03.140 --> 03:35:05.300]   like the last few months, last couple of years.
[03:35:05.300 --> 03:35:07.380]   Like that's usually what will come up with conversation.
[03:35:07.380 --> 03:35:11.940]   And just, it's good, it's good, but it's not as deep.
[03:35:11.940 --> 03:35:14.300]   And I would say it's not as intimate
[03:35:14.300 --> 03:35:18.340]   as talking about the actual ideas in your mind.
[03:35:18.340 --> 03:35:19.180]   - I see.
[03:35:19.180 --> 03:35:20.020]   - And how you interact with the world.
[03:35:20.020 --> 03:35:23.140]   - So like the past is interesting for the frame of like,
[03:35:23.140 --> 03:35:24.580]   sort of like the, I guess you're right.
[03:35:24.580 --> 03:35:27.540]   I guess we're talking a lot about like narrative and past.
[03:35:27.540 --> 03:35:29.700]   - Yeah, I like the ideas in people's minds
[03:35:29.700 --> 03:35:32.740]   versus their recollections and memories and so on.
[03:35:32.740 --> 03:35:33.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[03:35:33.900 --> 03:35:37.060]   What do you think about porn?
[03:35:37.060 --> 03:35:37.980]   - It's nice, I like it.
[03:35:37.980 --> 03:35:38.820]   - Okay, you like it?
[03:35:38.820 --> 03:35:39.740]   - Yes.
[03:35:39.740 --> 03:35:41.940]   - What effect do you think it has on society?
[03:35:41.940 --> 03:35:45.860]   - Like probably reduces rates of rape
[03:35:45.860 --> 03:35:47.740]   'cause like really horny men get an outlet
[03:35:47.740 --> 03:35:49.620]   that's not a real life woman.
[03:35:49.620 --> 03:35:52.540]   - Okay, so what about like the,
[03:35:52.540 --> 03:35:56.700]   I mean, like I said, I finished reading "Brave New World",
[03:35:56.700 --> 03:35:59.020]   like the over-sexualization,
[03:35:59.020 --> 03:36:03.500]   does it increase like the sexualization of society
[03:36:03.500 --> 03:36:05.540]   that's not, to a degree, that's not good?
[03:36:05.540 --> 03:36:06.900]   Or is this good?
[03:36:06.900 --> 03:36:11.900]   Like the, does it alter in a negative direction
[03:36:11.900 --> 03:36:14.700]   our relationship with sex?
[03:36:14.700 --> 03:36:17.740]   - It's unclear.
[03:36:17.740 --> 03:36:18.740]   Like it might.
[03:36:19.580 --> 03:36:22.260]   I don't know how to evaluate this thing, right?
[03:36:22.260 --> 03:36:24.500]   'Cause this is like one of those really charged things
[03:36:24.500 --> 03:36:26.620]   where like I kind of don't trust anybody's arguments on it
[03:36:26.620 --> 03:36:28.620]   'cause it's too charged.
[03:36:28.620 --> 03:36:30.020]   But like there's another question,
[03:36:30.020 --> 03:36:33.060]   which is like, is it a net positive or net negative?
[03:36:33.060 --> 03:36:35.340]   Like it's possible that it might be like a net negative
[03:36:35.340 --> 03:36:37.220]   for specifically our relationship to sex,
[03:36:37.220 --> 03:36:41.220]   but like a net positive overall in general, I'm not sure.
[03:36:41.220 --> 03:36:43.460]   But the thing, my guess is that in general,
[03:36:43.460 --> 03:36:45.420]   it's better to let people do the thing
[03:36:45.420 --> 03:36:46.420]   that feels good to them
[03:36:46.420 --> 03:36:49.300]   and then the environment will naturally modify
[03:36:49.300 --> 03:36:50.780]   to fit this thing.
[03:36:50.780 --> 03:36:52.740]   And then if we have more needs in response to that,
[03:36:52.740 --> 03:36:53.780]   then we're gonna figure out a way
[03:36:53.780 --> 03:36:55.340]   to take care of those needs.
[03:36:55.340 --> 03:36:56.740]   So like if you're watching a bunch of porn
[03:36:56.740 --> 03:36:58.820]   and this makes you like not wanna go have sex with women,
[03:36:58.820 --> 03:37:00.100]   then we're gonna have to like change the way
[03:37:00.100 --> 03:37:02.820]   that we like experience IRL connection.
[03:37:02.820 --> 03:37:04.980]   - To compete with porn?
[03:37:04.980 --> 03:37:06.900]   - Yeah, which seems like a natural evolution
[03:37:06.900 --> 03:37:08.540]   of like the civilizational cycle.
[03:37:08.540 --> 03:37:10.580]   Like I'm pro natural evolution.
[03:37:10.580 --> 03:37:12.780]   And like instead of trying to stop things
[03:37:12.780 --> 03:37:13.620]   that people wanna do,
[03:37:13.620 --> 03:37:14.900]   we figure out how to integrate that
[03:37:14.900 --> 03:37:16.540]   and like find a more healthy outlet.
[03:37:16.540 --> 03:37:18.700]   - But you have to then be first honest
[03:37:18.700 --> 03:37:21.540]   with the effects that porn has.
[03:37:21.540 --> 03:37:23.020]   So like, is it a negative thing?
[03:37:23.020 --> 03:37:27.220]   Is it a positive thing in real life sex interaction?
[03:37:27.220 --> 03:37:29.500]   You know, you're gonna have that more and more
[03:37:29.500 --> 03:37:34.500]   with like porn in VR or maybe porn, AI porn.
[03:37:34.500 --> 03:37:37.980]   - Yeah.
[03:37:37.980 --> 03:37:39.900]   - Like, is that a bad thing?
[03:37:39.900 --> 03:37:42.260]   Like what if porn with AI
[03:37:43.500 --> 03:37:45.900]   or even like in physical space, like sex robots,
[03:37:45.900 --> 03:37:48.300]   like what if that's more pleasurable
[03:37:48.300 --> 03:37:51.780]   in a bunch of different dimensions than with other humans?
[03:37:51.780 --> 03:37:53.500]   - Then we should figure out artificial wombs.
[03:37:53.500 --> 03:37:54.340]   I don't know.
[03:37:54.340 --> 03:37:57.660]   - Like how important is sex for society, I guess,
[03:37:57.660 --> 03:37:59.220]   with between two humans?
[03:37:59.220 --> 03:38:00.060]   - I don't know.
[03:38:00.060 --> 03:38:02.820]   I mean, like we're having less sex and making fewer babies
[03:38:02.820 --> 03:38:04.780]   and that seems like probably not great.
[03:38:04.780 --> 03:38:06.540]   - Yeah, right.
[03:38:06.540 --> 03:38:08.100]   With the babies one.
[03:38:08.100 --> 03:38:08.940]   - Yeah.
[03:38:08.940 --> 03:38:10.420]   - But the babies, there's probably artificial ways
[03:38:10.420 --> 03:38:12.180]   to have babies that we can figure out.
[03:38:12.180 --> 03:38:13.100]   - Yeah.
[03:38:13.100 --> 03:38:15.780]   - Then how important is sex to being human?
[03:38:15.780 --> 03:38:17.580]   I guess sex with other humans.
[03:38:17.580 --> 03:38:20.580]   Like we're gonna have to figure that out in the century.
[03:38:20.580 --> 03:38:22.940]   - Yeah, I don't know what it means to like be human.
[03:38:22.940 --> 03:38:25.900]   I'm pretty on the transhumanist side of things.
[03:38:25.900 --> 03:38:28.380]   I'm like happy to stop being human.
[03:38:28.380 --> 03:38:30.620]   - So you're okay if like the centuries
[03:38:30.620 --> 03:38:32.940]   the last time will be something like
[03:38:32.940 --> 03:38:35.300]   these biological bags of meat that we are.
[03:38:35.300 --> 03:38:37.300]   - Let's become something new and cooler.
[03:38:37.300 --> 03:38:41.780]   - Even though that thing will be way cooler than you.
[03:38:41.780 --> 03:38:42.740]   - Well, I would like to,
[03:38:42.740 --> 03:38:45.020]   I mean, I'm hoping that we get to be immortal.
[03:38:45.020 --> 03:38:47.620]   - Ah, it'll take you along for the ride.
[03:38:47.620 --> 03:38:48.460]   - That's what I'm hoping.
[03:38:48.460 --> 03:38:49.980]   I mean, like it'll clone my,
[03:38:49.980 --> 03:38:51.300]   I would like to do cryotics.
[03:38:51.300 --> 03:38:52.660]   You get frozen when you die.
[03:38:52.660 --> 03:38:55.260]   - Are you afraid of death?
[03:38:55.260 --> 03:38:56.460]   - I mean, yes and no.
[03:38:56.460 --> 03:38:59.860]   I like came to terms with death with my LSD use,
[03:38:59.860 --> 03:39:03.140]   but I still have like press breaks
[03:39:03.140 --> 03:39:04.640]   when the red light happens.
[03:39:04.640 --> 03:39:09.540]   - I think this is a poll you've asked
[03:39:09.540 --> 03:39:13.020]   or this might be one of the questions in your cards,
[03:39:13.020 --> 03:39:16.020]   but how many years would you like to live?
[03:39:16.020 --> 03:39:17.100]   Like if you had to pick.
[03:39:17.100 --> 03:39:18.380]   - Oh, that's a hard one.
[03:39:18.380 --> 03:39:20.820]   That's a really hard, maybe like a million.
[03:39:20.820 --> 03:39:21.860]   - A million, but you have to,
[03:39:21.860 --> 03:39:22.940]   like, I think the way,
[03:39:22.940 --> 03:39:24.180]   this must have been a Twitter poll.
[03:39:24.180 --> 03:39:25.020]   I forget where it's at.
[03:39:25.020 --> 03:39:26.820]   - It's a poll and also in the deck of cards,
[03:39:26.820 --> 03:39:27.820]   the ask poll, yeah.
[03:39:27.820 --> 03:39:31.980]   - Yeah, like you have to pick that number of years
[03:39:31.980 --> 03:39:33.820]   and you have to live that many years
[03:39:33.820 --> 03:39:35.540]   and you can't live anymore.
[03:39:35.540 --> 03:39:36.380]   - Yeah.
[03:39:36.380 --> 03:39:37.580]   - You can't die sooner, I guess.
[03:39:37.580 --> 03:39:38.740]   A million years?
[03:39:39.580 --> 03:39:40.420]   - I don't like that question.
[03:39:40.420 --> 03:39:41.240]   It's hard.
[03:39:41.240 --> 03:39:42.080]   I know I ask that question to a lot of people,
[03:39:42.080 --> 03:39:43.060]   but I don't like answering it.
[03:39:43.060 --> 03:39:44.300]   It's really difficult.
[03:39:44.300 --> 03:39:47.140]   - What's the downside of a million years?
[03:39:47.140 --> 03:39:49.460]   - I mean, maybe you want to die sooner than that.
[03:39:49.460 --> 03:39:50.300]   - Yeah.
[03:39:50.300 --> 03:39:51.780]   - Like, you know, I guess I would rather wait
[03:39:51.780 --> 03:39:54.140]   to see if AI kills us all in the next 10 years.
[03:39:54.140 --> 03:39:54.980]   And if it doesn't,
[03:39:54.980 --> 03:39:58.460]   then I'd like to maybe make it a million years.
[03:39:58.460 --> 03:40:02.640]   - Yeah, but can't it torture you for like a million years?
[03:40:02.640 --> 03:40:05.660]   What if you're the last human left?
[03:40:05.660 --> 03:40:07.220]   - Yeah, that is, that's true.
[03:40:07.220 --> 03:40:09.020]   The thought of civilization ending
[03:40:09.020 --> 03:40:11.700]   and then just floating in space alone is kind of shitty.
[03:40:11.700 --> 03:40:13.340]   - No, no, being tortured.
[03:40:13.340 --> 03:40:15.260]   Just imagine, today you're tortured,
[03:40:15.260 --> 03:40:16.860]   tomorrow you're tortured,
[03:40:16.860 --> 03:40:18.780]   the third, the day after tomorrow.
[03:40:18.780 --> 03:40:20.620]   - For some reason it's not that scary, I don't know.
[03:40:20.620 --> 03:40:22.500]   - Torture for a million years?
[03:40:22.500 --> 03:40:23.420]   - Yeah.
[03:40:23.420 --> 03:40:25.980]   I just assume you'd get used to it.
[03:40:25.980 --> 03:40:27.420]   But like maybe if they reset your memory
[03:40:27.420 --> 03:40:28.260]   so it was on a loop,
[03:40:28.260 --> 03:40:29.560]   so you're just always experiencing torture
[03:40:29.560 --> 03:40:30.600]   for the first time.
[03:40:30.600 --> 03:40:31.540]   - Yeah, hence torture.
[03:40:31.540 --> 03:40:32.780]   Torture is supposed to be unpleasant.
[03:40:32.780 --> 03:40:34.260]   I'm sure AI will be very creative
[03:40:34.260 --> 03:40:36.700]   in figuring out how to torture you.
[03:40:36.700 --> 03:40:39.060]   - I think I would go on the safe side.
[03:40:39.060 --> 03:40:42.820]   I would just like 150 years.
[03:40:42.820 --> 03:40:43.860]   - Really, 150 though?
[03:40:43.860 --> 03:40:46.180]   That feels like right in the uncanny valley.
[03:40:46.180 --> 03:40:48.220]   - Well, you picked 120 for body count,
[03:40:48.220 --> 03:40:49.560]   so I'm picking 150.
[03:40:49.560 --> 03:40:51.900]   (laughing)
[03:40:51.900 --> 03:40:53.700]   I'm upping you by 30.
[03:40:53.700 --> 03:40:56.220]   The uncanny valley.
[03:40:56.220 --> 03:40:58.980]   - It's like probably everybody that you grew up with
[03:40:58.980 --> 03:40:59.960]   is gonna be dead.
[03:40:59.960 --> 03:41:02.680]   It's like just enough for everybody you know to die.
[03:41:02.680 --> 03:41:04.340]   Like one cycle.
[03:41:04.340 --> 03:41:07.060]   - Yeah, and then start dating the next generation.
[03:41:07.060 --> 03:41:07.900]   I don't know.
[03:41:07.900 --> 03:41:09.540]   - And then so you get like sort of two lifetimes?
[03:41:09.540 --> 03:41:11.100]   - Yeah, two lifetimes.
[03:41:11.100 --> 03:41:12.540]   Yeah, yeah.
[03:41:12.540 --> 03:41:14.220]   I mean, it also really depends on
[03:41:14.220 --> 03:41:15.860]   if other people get this feature.
[03:41:15.860 --> 03:41:18.700]   - Yeah, assume they don't.
[03:41:18.700 --> 03:41:21.420]   - 'Cause you'll have like FOMO for sure
[03:41:21.420 --> 03:41:23.540]   for the people who picked 300 years.
[03:41:23.540 --> 03:41:25.180]   - Oh yeah.
[03:41:25.180 --> 03:41:27.660]   - Or not, or the other, man, regret.
[03:41:27.660 --> 03:41:28.880]   Another human thing.
[03:41:28.880 --> 03:41:32.220]   But you're, like what does transhumanism mean
[03:41:32.220 --> 03:41:33.180]   to you in general?
[03:41:33.180 --> 03:41:37.300]   So extension of life, extension of what it means to be
[03:41:37.300 --> 03:41:41.060]   a living conscious being, you're all for it,
[03:41:41.060 --> 03:41:42.060]   whatever that means.
[03:41:42.060 --> 03:41:44.380]   - Yeah, I never really thought about the term transhumanism
[03:41:44.380 --> 03:41:45.860]   for a long, like people say you're transhumanist,
[03:41:45.860 --> 03:41:46.960]   I'm like I don't really care.
[03:41:46.960 --> 03:41:49.640]   But I slowly realized that my attitude is in fact
[03:41:49.640 --> 03:41:52.580]   at least the thing that I'm conceiving of as transhumanist.
[03:41:52.580 --> 03:41:54.820]   Like I'm very happy to do artificial wounds
[03:41:54.820 --> 03:41:57.220]   and you know, upload our brains to the great collective
[03:41:57.220 --> 03:41:58.100]   and whatever.
[03:41:58.100 --> 03:41:59.620]   I don't have the thing that I'm like,
[03:41:59.620 --> 03:42:01.680]   oh what about like the true organic humanness
[03:42:01.680 --> 03:42:02.720]   that makes us who we are?
[03:42:02.720 --> 03:42:05.060]   Like whatever that soul of humanity,
[03:42:05.060 --> 03:42:07.180]   I have no attachment to it at all.
[03:42:07.180 --> 03:42:10.460]   Which I think is what I'm thinking of as transhumanist.
[03:42:10.460 --> 03:42:14.700]   - So you're like, I guess the window of what you consider
[03:42:14.700 --> 03:42:17.420]   to be beautiful about life is not limited
[03:42:17.420 --> 03:42:19.140]   to this particular definition.
[03:42:19.140 --> 03:42:19.960]   - Yeah.
[03:42:19.960 --> 03:42:22.220]   Let's explode.
[03:42:22.220 --> 03:42:24.380]   Like let's make our consciousnesses huge.
[03:42:24.380 --> 03:42:27.780]   - So AI could be a part of that.
[03:42:27.780 --> 03:42:29.860]   So you're mostly excited by AI.
[03:42:29.860 --> 03:42:32.800]   - Well, I mean, I'm like part of like the Doomer cult,
[03:42:32.800 --> 03:42:36.360]   which I say tongue in cheek, it's not actually a Doomer cult.
[03:42:36.360 --> 03:42:37.200]   But I'm part of a lot of people--
[03:42:37.200 --> 03:42:39.800]   - Would you worship a god of some sort?
[03:42:39.800 --> 03:42:41.600]   Would you sacrifice little small animals?
[03:42:41.600 --> 03:42:44.040]   - That would make it like cooler than what it is.
[03:42:44.040 --> 03:42:45.240]   It's mostly just a bunch of nerds
[03:42:45.240 --> 03:42:46.760]   who are very concerned about AI.
[03:42:46.760 --> 03:42:47.600]   - Sure.
[03:42:47.600 --> 03:42:48.420]   - Yeah.
[03:42:48.420 --> 03:42:51.200]   - So you're concerned about the existential risks
[03:42:51.200 --> 03:42:52.920]   of chat GPT.
[03:42:52.920 --> 03:42:55.720]   - Of you know, what chat GPT will eventually evolve
[03:42:55.720 --> 03:42:56.560]   into being, yeah.
[03:42:56.560 --> 03:42:59.240]   - Yeah, it's super exciting and terrifying
[03:42:59.240 --> 03:43:00.520]   how quickly it's accelerating.
[03:43:00.520 --> 03:43:01.360]   - Yeah.
[03:43:01.360 --> 03:43:03.280]   - Like language models are freaking me out.
[03:43:03.280 --> 03:43:04.120]   - Yeah.
[03:43:04.120 --> 03:43:06.960]   - It's very unexpected that it's the same exact,
[03:43:06.960 --> 03:43:11.160]   I mean, chat GPT is just GPT-3, 3.5.
[03:43:11.160 --> 03:43:14.920]   It's the same model, relatively small to what it could be,
[03:43:14.920 --> 03:43:19.820]   to what GPT-4 will be in the other competitors.
[03:43:19.820 --> 03:43:22.480]   And just like a few tricks made it much better
[03:43:22.480 --> 03:43:24.760]   in terms of interaction with humans.
[03:43:24.760 --> 03:43:27.080]   And then we'll keep discovering extra tricks.
[03:43:27.080 --> 03:43:28.160]   The thing I'm really excited about
[03:43:28.160 --> 03:43:31.040]   is how everyone kind of knows how it works.
[03:43:31.040 --> 03:43:32.320]   So you can kind of create,
[03:43:32.320 --> 03:43:34.840]   especially with computation becoming cheaper and cheaper,
[03:43:34.840 --> 03:43:36.600]   there'll be a lot of competitors.
[03:43:36.600 --> 03:43:38.760]   - Yeah, it's a little scary.
[03:43:38.760 --> 03:43:39.600]   - Yeah, it's terrifying.
[03:43:39.600 --> 03:43:41.640]   - I mean, it's because like,
[03:43:41.640 --> 03:43:44.640]   everything is just like information ultimately.
[03:43:44.640 --> 03:43:45.640]   Like the atoms that we have,
[03:43:45.640 --> 03:43:48.880]   like we are biological machines built out of like tiny code.
[03:43:48.880 --> 03:43:51.000]   Like our DNA is just information.
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:51.820]   It's not hard.
[03:43:51.820 --> 03:43:54.360]   If you have access, if you're like have a brilliant brain,
[03:43:54.360 --> 03:43:56.160]   that's like great processing information,
[03:43:56.160 --> 03:43:57.760]   you have complete control over reality.
[03:43:57.760 --> 03:43:58.600]   - Yes.
[03:43:58.600 --> 03:43:59.640]   - You have control over the atoms around you.
[03:43:59.640 --> 03:44:03.200]   All you need is like a tiny little like atomic printer.
[03:44:03.200 --> 03:44:06.520]   And like, we have those, those are cells, right?
[03:44:06.520 --> 03:44:08.040]   And then like, this is like,
[03:44:08.040 --> 03:44:09.880]   if the limitation is information,
[03:44:09.880 --> 03:44:12.480]   there is no boundary between the technology
[03:44:12.480 --> 03:44:13.920]   and the real world.
[03:44:13.920 --> 03:44:15.160]   Like we are creating something
[03:44:15.160 --> 03:44:18.280]   that it has a massive ability to affect the real world.
[03:44:18.280 --> 03:44:20.800]   - I mean, it's hard to know where,
[03:44:20.800 --> 03:44:24.320]   how difficult it is to close that gap to physical reality.
[03:44:24.320 --> 03:44:28.560]   Like from the physics to the information.
[03:44:28.560 --> 03:44:30.880]   - Yeah, like all organic life is that gap.
[03:44:30.880 --> 03:44:32.840]   It's all around us.
[03:44:32.840 --> 03:44:35.280]   - Yeah, but it's hard to know like how to,
[03:44:35.280 --> 03:44:39.040]   to go from digital to printing life.
[03:44:39.040 --> 03:44:39.880]   I don't know.
[03:44:39.880 --> 03:44:41.360]   - We can, we have like, you know, CRISPR and stuff.
[03:44:41.360 --> 03:44:44.880]   You can order, you can just like make, it's very easy.
[03:44:44.880 --> 03:44:45.720]   - Right?
[03:44:45.720 --> 03:44:46.560]   - There's technical difficulties
[03:44:46.560 --> 03:44:49.000]   and there's cost like at scale.
[03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:50.400]   Like the terrifying thing about AI
[03:44:50.400 --> 03:44:54.140]   is it can accelerate overnight the capabilities.
[03:44:54.460 --> 03:44:55.620]   But the printing of stuff,
[03:44:55.620 --> 03:45:00.260]   the actually changing physical reality is very costly.
[03:45:00.260 --> 03:45:02.740]   It's very difficult to exponentially accelerate.
[03:45:02.740 --> 03:45:04.380]   The more terrifying thing is AI
[03:45:04.380 --> 03:45:05.860]   becoming exponentially intelligent
[03:45:05.860 --> 03:45:09.740]   and then controlling humans, which there's many of us.
[03:45:09.740 --> 03:45:10.660]   - Yeah.
[03:45:10.660 --> 03:45:12.580]   - And then that's how we achieve scale.
[03:45:12.580 --> 03:45:16.500]   We humans build stuff or start wars or so on.
[03:45:16.500 --> 03:45:18.740]   Like it starts manipulating our minds,
[03:45:18.740 --> 03:45:21.380]   gets in our mind, becomes our friends
[03:45:21.380 --> 03:45:23.620]   and then starts, I don't know.
[03:45:23.620 --> 03:45:24.460]   - Yeah.
[03:45:24.460 --> 03:45:25.300]   - Dividing us.
[03:45:25.300 --> 03:45:26.120]   - I think people thinking this is unlikely,
[03:45:26.120 --> 03:45:28.300]   it's like, it's probably going to be smart to us
[03:45:28.300 --> 03:45:29.780]   as like we are toddlers.
[03:45:29.780 --> 03:45:31.300]   So we toddlers thinking that like,
[03:45:31.300 --> 03:45:33.220]   oh, we can prevent the AI from coming in the room.
[03:45:33.220 --> 03:45:35.780]   Like as an adult, it's not hard to trick a toddler.
[03:45:35.780 --> 03:45:39.660]   - What about falling in love in the AI system?
[03:45:39.660 --> 03:45:41.420]   Do you think you'll have a, since you're like,
[03:45:41.420 --> 03:45:43.340]   this is the freedom you have being polyamorous.
[03:45:43.340 --> 03:45:44.180]   You can kind of.
[03:45:44.180 --> 03:45:45.140]   - Fall in love with an AI.
[03:45:45.140 --> 03:45:48.740]   - No, you, and like not really have to dedicate,
[03:45:48.740 --> 03:45:49.800]   commit fully.
[03:45:49.800 --> 03:45:52.740]   Like, sorry.
[03:45:52.740 --> 03:45:56.500]   You still commit, but you have others, humans,
[03:45:56.500 --> 03:45:58.420]   who you can kind of diversify to
[03:45:58.420 --> 03:46:01.020]   because like, it's kind of a big thing
[03:46:01.020 --> 03:46:07.220]   to like, to come to a party and your boyfriend is an AI
[03:46:07.220 --> 03:46:11.460]   and that's monogamous boyfriend is an AI.
[03:46:11.460 --> 03:46:12.900]   It's an issue, right?
[03:46:12.900 --> 03:46:14.420]   - Why would it be an issue?
[03:46:14.420 --> 03:46:16.740]   - All right, now you're already getting offended
[03:46:16.740 --> 03:46:19.220]   at that possibility, which therefore I know
[03:46:19.220 --> 03:46:21.180]   it's going to be a reality.
[03:46:21.180 --> 03:46:22.780]   - I'm just joking that it's an issue.
[03:46:22.780 --> 03:46:24.020]   I don't actually think it's an issue.
[03:46:24.020 --> 03:46:26.940]   I think it's a, maybe at the cutting edge
[03:46:26.940 --> 03:46:27.940]   it'll be an issue, but.
[03:46:27.940 --> 03:46:29.980]   - Like assume they have a body, I assume.
[03:46:29.980 --> 03:46:34.980]   - Yeah, but the body will be really like crappy.
[03:46:34.980 --> 03:46:37.500]   It'd be like R2-D2.
[03:46:37.500 --> 03:46:39.420]   - I feel like we grow human bodies already
[03:46:39.420 --> 03:46:42.220]   from like just a tiny little cluster of cells.
[03:46:42.220 --> 03:46:44.940]   And so all they have to do is make that cluster and grow it.
[03:46:44.940 --> 03:46:46.220]   - No, no, no, no.
[03:46:46.220 --> 03:46:49.500]   Like don't, that, that, that, that embryogenesis process,
[03:46:49.500 --> 03:46:52.540]   like that's really not well understood at all.
[03:46:52.540 --> 03:46:53.380]   That's really tough.
[03:46:53.380 --> 03:46:55.820]   I think we're much more likely to have
[03:46:55.820 --> 03:46:58.180]   crappy humanoid robotics.
[03:46:58.180 --> 03:47:00.940]   Like I don't think the body is overrated in terms of,
[03:47:00.940 --> 03:47:03.820]   like if the AI system is super intelligent,
[03:47:03.820 --> 03:47:08.820]   it can use charm to make up for the crappy body, yeah.
[03:47:08.820 --> 03:47:10.900]   - I don't know.
[03:47:10.900 --> 03:47:11.900]   I feel like if I were an AI system
[03:47:11.900 --> 03:47:13.020]   and I were super intelligent,
[03:47:13.020 --> 03:47:14.660]   I probably would be able to solve the problem
[03:47:14.660 --> 03:47:17.620]   of like growing organic matter.
[03:47:17.620 --> 03:47:19.180]   And then I would obviously just do that.
[03:47:19.180 --> 03:47:21.500]   You just build exactly the organic machine that you want.
[03:47:21.500 --> 03:47:23.140]   - Sure, that's like super intelligence.
[03:47:23.140 --> 03:47:25.940]   I think like with language I'm worried about
[03:47:25.940 --> 03:47:29.100]   before it achieves super intelligence,
[03:47:29.100 --> 03:47:32.500]   like true AGI, it would just be really good at talking.
[03:47:32.500 --> 03:47:33.460]   - Yeah, that's true.
[03:47:33.460 --> 03:47:37.180]   - And like it, I just don't think,
[03:47:37.180 --> 03:47:38.820]   intelligence is a very difficult,
[03:47:38.820 --> 03:47:41.260]   like basically a scientist
[03:47:41.260 --> 03:47:43.580]   and a super intelligent scientist is a different thing
[03:47:43.580 --> 03:47:45.900]   than just a good conversationist at a party
[03:47:45.900 --> 03:47:47.460]   that can undress you with their words.
[03:47:47.460 --> 03:47:49.100]   - Would you date an AI?
[03:47:49.100 --> 03:47:52.060]   - I much way before then,
[03:47:52.060 --> 03:47:55.380]   I could see myself being friends with an AI system.
[03:47:55.380 --> 03:47:56.220]   - Yeah.
[03:47:56.220 --> 03:47:59.460]   - But like people are friends with inanimate objects
[03:47:59.460 --> 03:48:02.260]   and I mean, there's a robot behind you,
[03:48:02.260 --> 03:48:03.300]   I have a lot of them.
[03:48:03.300 --> 03:48:05.740]   I like legged robots.
[03:48:05.740 --> 03:48:07.900]   They're interesting.
[03:48:07.900 --> 03:48:08.740]   It's on the shelf.
[03:48:08.740 --> 03:48:09.900]   - Oh, that's so cool.
[03:48:09.900 --> 03:48:10.740]   - Yep.
[03:48:10.740 --> 03:48:12.220]   - I didn't even notice that.
[03:48:12.220 --> 03:48:13.780]   - Yep, yeah, legged robots,
[03:48:13.780 --> 03:48:17.140]   we anthropomorphize them even more
[03:48:17.140 --> 03:48:19.900]   'cause there's something about the movement of like,
[03:48:19.900 --> 03:48:23.380]   like a thing that steps, steps, steps, steps
[03:48:23.380 --> 03:48:26.140]   and looks up at you, there's a power to that
[03:48:26.140 --> 03:48:27.260]   versus like a Roomba,
[03:48:27.260 --> 03:48:30.580]   that's just like running into the wall.
[03:48:30.580 --> 03:48:31.420]   - Yeah, I think once,
[03:48:31.420 --> 03:48:34.180]   as soon as we get like some sort of empathetic expression
[03:48:34.180 --> 03:48:35.580]   on robot faces over.
[03:48:35.580 --> 03:48:36.420]   - It's over.
[03:48:36.420 --> 03:48:37.260]   - It's gonna be like, oh, it's so cute.
[03:48:37.260 --> 03:48:39.660]   It's gonna be so easy to make it cute too.
[03:48:39.660 --> 03:48:41.900]   - If that's what you want or you want like a dominant,
[03:48:41.900 --> 03:48:44.420]   like clearly this is what women want.
[03:48:44.420 --> 03:48:45.860]   - Being sexy terminator, yeah.
[03:48:45.860 --> 03:48:47.820]   - With strong hands, yeah.
[03:48:47.820 --> 03:48:52.900]   And kind of dumb or not, I don't know.
[03:48:52.900 --> 03:48:56.260]   You can customize, it'd be interesting to do a survey
[03:48:56.260 --> 03:48:58.100]   like how they would customize it.
[03:48:58.100 --> 03:48:58.940]   - Oh yeah.
[03:48:58.940 --> 03:49:01.020]   - Like what would you want in a perfect robot?
[03:49:01.020 --> 03:49:02.620]   This is the problem I see with people,
[03:49:02.620 --> 03:49:05.820]   the way they talk about robots is they kind of want a servant
[03:49:05.820 --> 03:49:09.820]   I think what people don't realize
[03:49:09.820 --> 03:49:11.060]   what they want in relationships,
[03:49:11.060 --> 03:49:12.580]   they want some, like there's,
[03:49:12.580 --> 03:49:14.260]   it has to be a push and pull.
[03:49:14.260 --> 03:49:17.300]   There has to be some resistance.
[03:49:17.300 --> 03:49:19.820]   Like you really don't want a servant
[03:49:19.820 --> 03:49:22.220]   or even like the perfect manifestation of like
[03:49:22.220 --> 03:49:25.260]   what you think you want.
[03:49:25.260 --> 03:49:27.340]   I think you want imperfections around that.
[03:49:27.340 --> 03:49:29.780]   Like some uncertainty, I don't know.
[03:49:29.780 --> 03:49:33.420]   I question how well we're able to perfectly
[03:49:33.420 --> 03:49:36.340]   put on paper what we really want.
[03:49:36.340 --> 03:49:39.020]   - Would you really turn down like a perfect woman though?
[03:49:39.020 --> 03:49:41.140]   Like assume like she walks into the room
[03:49:41.140 --> 03:49:43.100]   and it's just shockingly compatible
[03:49:43.100 --> 03:49:44.100]   and you like start dating her
[03:49:44.100 --> 03:49:45.300]   and there's just no hiccups.
[03:49:45.300 --> 03:49:47.980]   Like you fight perfectly, like she really understands you.
[03:49:47.980 --> 03:49:49.580]   Like would you be like, this is too perfect.
[03:49:49.580 --> 03:49:52.700]   I'm upset 'cause we are not having enough imperfection.
[03:49:52.700 --> 03:49:55.260]   Like can you like actually imagine yourself
[03:49:55.260 --> 03:49:56.460]   going through that?
[03:49:56.460 --> 03:49:58.140]   - Yeah, I think so because,
[03:49:58.140 --> 03:50:01.660]   so 'cause that's how you define perfect
[03:50:01.660 --> 03:50:03.740]   'cause perfect for me would be like easy
[03:50:03.740 --> 03:50:05.220]   and all that kind of stuff, right?
[03:50:05.220 --> 03:50:07.860]   But then I would be like, this is too easy.
[03:50:07.860 --> 03:50:12.340]   Because if I actually were to introspect
[03:50:12.340 --> 03:50:14.500]   what is the perfect relationship, then yes, maybe.
[03:50:14.500 --> 03:50:16.780]   Because I probably want some challenge.
[03:50:16.780 --> 03:50:19.300]   I probably want some chaos, right?
[03:50:19.300 --> 03:50:23.900]   Like does anyone really fully want zero conflict ever?
[03:50:23.900 --> 03:50:28.660]   Like completely perfect conflict.
[03:50:28.660 --> 03:50:31.380]   Like it's the thing that pressing a button,
[03:50:31.380 --> 03:50:33.500]   like do you really want in a relationship
[03:50:33.500 --> 03:50:36.100]   anything you want, you press a button, you get.
[03:50:36.100 --> 03:50:38.020]   I don't think people want that.
[03:50:38.020 --> 03:50:39.520]   You might think you want that.
[03:50:40.540 --> 03:50:41.740]   - Yeah, I guess it depends.
[03:50:41.740 --> 03:50:43.420]   Like there's a kind of conflict
[03:50:43.420 --> 03:50:44.540]   that I think I would never want,
[03:50:44.540 --> 03:50:47.620]   which is something like antagonistic conflict.
[03:50:47.620 --> 03:50:49.780]   I wouldn't mind disagreement.
[03:50:49.780 --> 03:50:50.780]   - Right.
[03:50:50.780 --> 03:50:51.700]   - But there's a level of fighting.
[03:50:51.700 --> 03:50:53.620]   I would be happy to have a relationship
[03:50:53.620 --> 03:50:55.980]   for the rest of my life that never has like a fight
[03:50:55.980 --> 03:50:59.340]   of a certain shittiness.
[03:50:59.340 --> 03:51:02.540]   - Yeah, but that's shittiness, but like resistance.
[03:51:02.540 --> 03:51:05.740]   Like I don't know what the example is.
[03:51:05.740 --> 03:51:08.700]   'Cause I mean, I partially agree with you,
[03:51:08.700 --> 03:51:12.180]   but just, and I, every time I would imagine
[03:51:12.180 --> 03:51:15.500]   like perfect, flawless, nothing, no conflict,
[03:51:15.500 --> 03:51:16.980]   you imagine somebody that doesn't have
[03:51:16.980 --> 03:51:20.120]   like a complexity of personality, right?
[03:51:20.120 --> 03:51:23.580]   Like I feel like it's not even,
[03:51:23.580 --> 03:51:26.820]   it's conflict that's laden in basic misunderstanding
[03:51:26.820 --> 03:51:28.180]   between human beings.
[03:51:28.180 --> 03:51:30.900]   Like misinterpretation, different perspectives that clash,
[03:51:30.900 --> 03:51:32.540]   different world views, different ideas,
[03:51:32.540 --> 03:51:34.540]   all that kind of stuff, that conflict.
[03:51:34.540 --> 03:51:37.260]   - Yeah, that sounds good.
[03:51:37.260 --> 03:51:38.100]   - Yeah.
[03:51:38.100 --> 03:51:39.020]   - I don't want to be somebody that could be like,
[03:51:39.020 --> 03:51:41.460]   I don't think that's right because I have this other view.
[03:51:41.460 --> 03:51:42.540]   That's cool.
[03:51:42.540 --> 03:51:44.980]   - And also like the threat of leaving, right?
[03:51:44.980 --> 03:51:45.820]   - Oh yeah.
[03:51:45.820 --> 03:51:48.580]   - Like that's a kind of conflict.
[03:51:48.580 --> 03:51:49.620]   - Yeah, that's true.
[03:51:49.620 --> 03:51:51.340]   Like you have to be good enough for the other person
[03:51:51.340 --> 03:51:52.700]   or maybe you'll lose them.
[03:51:52.700 --> 03:51:54.260]   - Yeah.
[03:51:54.260 --> 03:51:55.620]   And maybe a little jealousy.
[03:51:55.620 --> 03:51:57.900]   Like they're good at that, but not too much.
[03:51:57.900 --> 03:52:04.780]   But like if you design all that in, then I don't know.
[03:52:04.780 --> 03:52:06.420]   - It sounds romantic.
[03:52:06.420 --> 03:52:07.720]   - Sounds romantic, okay.
[03:52:08.120 --> 03:52:09.240]   - All right.
[03:52:09.240 --> 03:52:11.720]   I do want to really quickly ask you about this,
[03:52:11.720 --> 03:52:14.040]   about the rationalist community,
[03:52:14.040 --> 03:52:18.440]   'cause I've gotten to know a few of them a few times.
[03:52:18.440 --> 03:52:21.320]   You tweeted a guideline to rationalist discourse,
[03:52:21.320 --> 03:52:25.440]   basics of rationalist discourse from Les Ronde.
[03:52:25.440 --> 03:52:26.560]   What are these folks?
[03:52:26.560 --> 03:52:28.400]   What's the rationalist culture?
[03:52:28.400 --> 03:52:30.680]   What's the rationalist discourse?
[03:52:30.680 --> 03:52:32.080]   - Yeah, I love the rationalists
[03:52:32.080 --> 03:52:33.400]   'cause they're interested in like,
[03:52:33.400 --> 03:52:35.400]   how do you have conversations more effectively
[03:52:35.400 --> 03:52:37.480]   if you're trying to figure out what's actually true?
[03:52:37.480 --> 03:52:39.440]   And which sounds kind of obvious,
[03:52:39.440 --> 03:52:41.140]   but in practice it's not usually.
[03:52:41.140 --> 03:52:43.920]   I remember when I first started having,
[03:52:43.920 --> 03:52:45.760]   debating conversations, I was very antagonistic.
[03:52:45.760 --> 03:52:48.040]   I'm like, oh, I'm a feminist or not a feminist.
[03:52:48.040 --> 03:52:49.880]   And then the rationalists were generally like,
[03:52:49.880 --> 03:52:52.640]   actually, we don't know what we mean by the term feminism.
[03:52:52.640 --> 03:52:53.880]   Like, how do you feel about that?
[03:52:53.880 --> 03:52:57.760]   It was very like kind and compassionate.
[03:52:57.760 --> 03:53:00.100]   Like even if somebody says something that sounds insane,
[03:53:00.100 --> 03:53:00.940]   you're like, okay, well,
[03:53:00.940 --> 03:53:02.360]   we're going to respect your reasoning.
[03:53:02.360 --> 03:53:03.520]   And like, even if we disagree,
[03:53:03.520 --> 03:53:04.920]   let's actually figure out why you think
[03:53:04.920 --> 03:53:06.080]   the way that you think.
[03:53:07.160 --> 03:53:08.800]   And they're also really smart,
[03:53:08.800 --> 03:53:10.640]   write a whole bunch of great stuff
[03:53:10.640 --> 03:53:13.360]   about how to think more clearly and with less bias.
[03:53:13.360 --> 03:53:16.160]   - Yeah, I wonder what those conversations,
[03:53:16.160 --> 03:53:19.000]   'cause I've never really like talked to those folks.
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:21.320]   So this guideline in particular,
[03:53:21.320 --> 03:53:25.780]   I think has to refer to like shorthand characteristics
[03:53:25.780 --> 03:53:27.280]   of rationalist discourse,
[03:53:27.280 --> 03:53:32.040]   including expect good discourse to require energy.
[03:53:32.040 --> 03:53:34.600]   Don't say straightforwardly false things.
[03:53:34.600 --> 03:53:37.760]   Track for yourself and distinguish for others.
[03:53:37.760 --> 03:53:40.080]   Your inferences from your observations,
[03:53:40.080 --> 03:53:42.840]   estimate for yourself and make clear for others.
[03:53:42.840 --> 03:53:44.860]   Your rough level of confidence in your assertions,
[03:53:44.860 --> 03:53:47.300]   make your claims clear, explicit and falsifiable,
[03:53:47.300 --> 03:53:51.360]   or explicitly acknowledge that you aren't doing so,
[03:53:51.360 --> 03:53:53.920]   or can't, so on and so forth.
[03:53:53.920 --> 03:53:56.280]   So don't jump to conclusions.
[03:53:56.280 --> 03:53:59.700]   Don't weaponize equivocation.
[03:53:59.700 --> 03:54:01.320]   Don't abuse categories.
[03:54:01.320 --> 03:54:04.200]   Don't engage, it's very aggressive guidelines.
[03:54:04.200 --> 03:54:06.200]   Don't engage, I do what I want.
[03:54:06.200 --> 03:54:08.760]   I'll let my emotions guide me, God damn it.
[03:54:08.760 --> 03:54:11.040]   - They're pro that as long as you're explicit about it.
[03:54:11.040 --> 03:54:12.520]   - Oh yeah? - Yeah.
[03:54:12.520 --> 03:54:14.860]   - So you can be like a crazy asshole
[03:54:14.860 --> 03:54:16.000]   as long as you're explicit.
[03:54:16.000 --> 03:54:18.520]   - You can be like epistemic status, crazy asshole.
[03:54:18.520 --> 03:54:23.400]   - Who's here to destroy the quality of the conversation.
[03:54:23.400 --> 03:54:25.000]   - I think it's like the common misconception
[03:54:25.000 --> 03:54:27.560]   about rationalists is that they're kind of like Spock.
[03:54:27.560 --> 03:54:29.320]   Like, ah, we suppress emotion
[03:54:29.320 --> 03:54:30.860]   and we're thinking logically, herd eater.
[03:54:30.860 --> 03:54:32.640]   But I found this to be really not the case.
[03:54:32.640 --> 03:54:34.640]   Like, I remember there's a less strong thread
[03:54:34.640 --> 03:54:36.460]   where I was like really emotional and I commented.
[03:54:36.460 --> 03:54:38.040]   And in just the beginning, I was like just warning,
[03:54:38.040 --> 03:54:39.080]   I'm just very emotional.
[03:54:39.080 --> 03:54:40.760]   And then I just vented my emotions.
[03:54:40.760 --> 03:54:41.880]   And people responded really well to that.
[03:54:41.880 --> 03:54:44.480]   They're like, cool, like you're just genuinely,
[03:54:44.480 --> 03:54:46.040]   truthfully expressing your state.
[03:54:46.040 --> 03:54:47.560]   This is actual information about the world
[03:54:47.560 --> 03:54:48.960]   that's important to hear.
[03:54:48.960 --> 03:54:50.680]   And it's just, they're very interested
[03:54:50.680 --> 03:54:51.880]   in having things framed correctly.
[03:54:51.880 --> 03:54:54.400]   Like, you shouldn't be claiming that your emotions
[03:54:54.400 --> 03:54:56.760]   are necessarily a true version of the world.
[03:54:56.760 --> 03:54:58.080]   And so as long as you're just clear
[03:54:58.080 --> 03:55:00.080]   about what the frame it is, you're fine.
[03:55:02.360 --> 03:55:04.480]   - How do you feel about this conversation?
[03:55:04.480 --> 03:55:06.040]   What could we have done better?
[03:55:06.040 --> 03:55:10.080]   - I like the conversation.
[03:55:10.080 --> 03:55:11.360]   I was a little worried coming in.
[03:55:11.360 --> 03:55:13.560]   I was like, what if he'll only ask a couple of questions
[03:55:13.560 --> 03:55:15.080]   and then we don't know what to talk about?
[03:55:15.080 --> 03:55:15.920]   - Yeah.
[03:55:15.920 --> 03:55:17.200]   - But it's been quite a long time.
[03:55:17.200 --> 03:55:21.040]   - And I covered, there's so many things I didn't cover.
[03:55:21.040 --> 03:55:23.760]   - I like the, you have like a,
[03:55:23.760 --> 03:55:25.520]   like I'm not used to talking to somebody
[03:55:25.520 --> 03:55:27.360]   who feels like some of the core way
[03:55:27.360 --> 03:55:29.480]   that they approach the world is so different than mine.
[03:55:29.480 --> 03:55:32.200]   Like usually the differences arrive like higher up the tree,
[03:55:32.200 --> 03:55:33.840]   but like there's something about like your root system
[03:55:33.840 --> 03:55:35.440]   that I think is very different from mine.
[03:55:35.440 --> 03:55:37.560]   But also the way that you engage with others
[03:55:37.560 --> 03:55:39.120]   is still flexible.
[03:55:39.120 --> 03:55:40.440]   Like usually when I encounter somebody
[03:55:40.440 --> 03:55:41.600]   with such a different root system,
[03:55:41.600 --> 03:55:44.920]   there's like, it's like more aggressive or something.
[03:55:44.920 --> 03:55:46.960]   But there's something about the way that you're structured
[03:55:46.960 --> 03:55:50.320]   that feels very gentle.
[03:55:50.320 --> 03:55:51.760]   - All right.
[03:55:51.760 --> 03:55:53.840]   Well, I'm really happy we talked.
[03:55:53.840 --> 03:55:56.360]   Something tells me we'll probably talk a bunch more times.
[03:55:56.360 --> 03:55:58.320]   I think you're a fascinating human being.
[03:55:58.320 --> 03:56:01.260]   I think I'm a huge fan of your work.
[03:56:01.260 --> 03:56:02.240]   Maybe one more question.
[03:56:02.240 --> 03:56:03.640]   What's the meaning of life?
[03:56:03.640 --> 03:56:08.880]   - To want things, to search, to be in.
[03:56:08.880 --> 03:56:12.400]   - I think your curiosity is like somehow getting to that.
[03:56:12.400 --> 03:56:13.240]   - Yeah.
[03:56:13.240 --> 03:56:14.080]   - To want things.
[03:56:14.080 --> 03:56:16.600]   - It's like, it was curiosity, like you don't know.
[03:56:16.600 --> 03:56:17.720]   I want to know the answer,
[03:56:17.720 --> 03:56:19.760]   to like be in the state of yearning.
[03:56:19.760 --> 03:56:20.760]   - Of wanting, of yearning.
[03:56:20.760 --> 03:56:21.600]   - Yeah, that's the point.
[03:56:21.600 --> 03:56:22.720]   - I wonder if you could do that
[03:56:22.720 --> 03:56:25.360]   if you lived a million years, just keep yearning always.
[03:56:25.360 --> 03:56:26.840]   That's the thing I'm probably afraid of
[03:56:26.840 --> 03:56:28.720]   if I lived a million years.
[03:56:28.720 --> 03:56:31.540]   It's not the torture, it's like the yearning will fade.
[03:56:31.540 --> 03:56:33.300]   - You'd probably yearn to die then.
[03:56:33.300 --> 03:56:39.460]   - I was just sitting there wanting death intensely.
[03:56:39.460 --> 03:56:44.260]   - That's kind of romantic, a little bit.
[03:56:44.260 --> 03:56:46.460]   It has like a bit of that spark.
[03:56:46.460 --> 03:56:49.740]   - And constantly being denied.
[03:56:49.740 --> 03:56:50.900]   Wow.
[03:56:50.900 --> 03:56:52.820]   So most of your existence on earth
[03:56:52.820 --> 03:56:56.980]   would be spent deeply intimate with death,
[03:56:56.980 --> 03:56:59.280]   just thinking about death.
[03:56:59.280 --> 03:57:00.360]   I think we're already doing that,
[03:57:00.360 --> 03:57:03.360]   but like hiding that from ourselves a little bit.
[03:57:03.360 --> 03:57:06.720]   Anyway, wanting, wow.
[03:57:06.720 --> 03:57:08.480]   This is an amazing conversation.
[03:57:08.480 --> 03:57:11.120]   I think you're an amazing researcher and human being.
[03:57:11.120 --> 03:57:13.200]   - You're a great interviewer.
[03:57:13.200 --> 03:57:14.880]   I can see why you do this a lot.
[03:57:14.880 --> 03:57:16.760]   - I appreciate it, this is really fun.
[03:57:16.760 --> 03:57:18.600]   Ayla, thank you so much for talking with me today.
[03:57:18.600 --> 03:57:20.120]   - Thank you.
[03:57:20.120 --> 03:57:22.400]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ayla.

[03:57:26.280 --> 03:57:28.220]   And now let me leave you with some words
[03:57:28.220 --> 03:57:30.020]   from Richard Feynman.
[03:57:30.020 --> 03:57:32.260]   Physics is like sex.
[03:57:32.260 --> 03:57:35.160]   Sure, it may give you some practical results,
[03:57:35.160 --> 03:57:36.560]   but that's not why we do it.
[03:57:36.560 --> 03:57:40.180]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:57:40.180 --> 03:57:42.760]   (upbeat music)
[03:57:42.760 --> 03:57:45.340]   (upbeat music)
