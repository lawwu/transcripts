[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220]   One of the most incredible things about human beings
[00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.480]   is that we are creators,
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.760]   and we're able to think abstractly and conceptually.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.760]   We're able to visualize places that we aren't,
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.880]   both physical places and places in life,
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.340]   non-physical concepts.
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.760]   And I think this is really, really valuable
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.760]   when it comes to goal setting.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.040]   We want to think about,
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.500]   is being in a different place worth it?
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.640]   If I go down this path of building wealth
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.320]   and becoming financially independent,
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.600]   is it gonna be worth it?
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.580]   It's one reason why I encourage you,
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.280]   spend a lot of time with wealthy people.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.920]   Take once a week, take somebody rich out to lunch
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.560]   and ask them, how did you get where you got to?
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.420]   Well, I try to do that here on the show for you a little bit
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.140]   and today I'm thrilled to have Jim Wang.
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.880]   Jim is an awesome guy,
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.520]   built a website called Bargaineering,
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.880]   was at the Pioneer,
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.800]   he's one of the pioneers
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.240]   of the online personal finance community,
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.600]   sold the website, got rich,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.320]   and he's here today to tell us what it's like
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.640]   so you can decide if you want to copy him.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:19.920]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.220]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.960]   I'm your host, I'm your guide, I'm your Sherpa,
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.700]   I'm your lead adventurer.
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.340]   Working hard each and every day to build a rich life now,
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.620]   while also constructing the foundation
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.060]   for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.340]   And today, my guest has done both those things.
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.020]   Longtime listeners of the show will recognize
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.420]   that as I really try to narrow in
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.780]   on what's the message of financial independence,
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.260]   or excuse me, what's the message
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.260]   of radical personal finance?
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.860]   I tried to home in on that and really get clear.
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.220]   And as far as I'm concerned,
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.900]   the best I've got so far is,
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.700]   it's about living a rich life now
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.580]   and building financial freedom
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.060]   in a short enough time span
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.020]   where you can actually conceive of it.
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.740]   I'm not against building financial freedom in 40 years,
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.300]   but I also don't think you gotta wait 40 years.
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.960]   I think a decade is a really reasonable amount of time.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.620]   And so part of my fulfilling that mission,
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.820]   that vision, that outline, that catchy statement
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.860]   is to bring you examples of people who've done it.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.580]   And we'll talk in the future, what is financial freedom?
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.780]   I've got the stages and steps of financial freedom,
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.220]   lots of different ways to define that.
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.120]   But today, my guest has done it.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.460]   He lived a rich life and built financial freedom
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.020]   in 10 years or less.
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.780]   And he proves that it's doable.
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.420]   More importantly, not only was it doable once,
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.900]   he's doing it again.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.220]   He's proving it again.
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.860]   And so I think you're really gonna enjoy
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.740]   this conversation with Jim Wang.
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.700]   Before I play the interview for you,
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.000]   two sponsors today.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.660]   Number one sponsor is Paladin Registry.
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.740]   Paladin Registry is my go-to solution
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.940]   that I went out and tried to find for you guys
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.540]   in answering the question of how do I find
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.960]   a great financial advisor?
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.780]   Many of you have written to me and spoken to me
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.260]   and said, Joshua, I appreciate the show.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.560]   And it's nice to have somebody
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.260]   who's a former financial advisor showing
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.500]   and talking about what it's like
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.220]   from an accurate perspective.
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.220]   And hey, would you work with me?
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.180]   And my answer is no.
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.620]   I'm not willing to make the time to do it.
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.980]   I have 24 hours in a day and I'm focused
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.620]   on trying to create good media.
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.820]   But I needed a solution.
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.900]   So I went out and found Paladin Registry,
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.980]   which was my way for you to be able to
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.240]   build for yourself a financial advisory team.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.340]   Now, I can't promise you that you're going
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.260]   to find a financial advisor that works for you
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.980]   through Paladin Registry.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.100]   But I can promise you that if you start your search there,
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.340]   you're off on a good foot.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.940]   The way it works is Paladin Registry
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.820]   is a registry service where financial advisors
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.280]   apply to be accepted.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.780]   Then the Paladin team does some detailed
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.660]   due diligence on them, their credentials,
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.260]   their background, their history of complaints,
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.060]   their philosophy, et cetera.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.620]   And then only after they are approved and vetted
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.620]   do they enter them into the registry service.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.460]   So you go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin,
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.300]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/P-A-L-A-D-I-N,
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.060]   link in the blog post for today's show,
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.060]   or if you just go on the website,
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.420]   you'll see on the sidebar,
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.800]   banners for Paladin Registry.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.640]   Click that banner.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.100]   That'll take you to a landing page.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.180]   You'll put in your name.
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.180]   Your address, your phone number, your email,
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.220]   all that stuff.
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.460]   Put in that information and Paladin will choose
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.120]   and select some advisors in your area
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.980]   to potentially work with you.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.980]   They'll get in touch with you.
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.900]   You can get in touch with them.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.900]   They'll send you the information so you're expecting it.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.800]   And then you can start the interview process
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.300]   to see if they can serve you and help you.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.240]   Each of them will be different.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.140]   I encourage you to interview multiple people
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.740]   and choose the one that works the best for you.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.140]   Radicalpersonalfinance.com/Paladin.
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.460]   Sponsor number two today is Jay Fleischman
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.580]   and the Student Loan Show.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.740]   Jay's been a guest on Radical Personal Finance
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.380]   several times and Jay's an awesome guy.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.660]   He does a great podcast, the Student Loan Show podcast.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.220]   If you have student loans or if you're even interested
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.780]   in the topic, go and listen to that.
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.940]   But more importantly, he provides consulting services,
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.340]   both legal and, I was gonna say illegal,
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.660]   both legal and in a non-attorney capacity,
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.460]   just simply as a consultant and an advisor.
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.180]   English language sometimes, legal and illegal services.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.580]   If you have student loans, you should sit down with Jay
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.860]   and develop a plan to pay off those student loans
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.140]   in the most advantageous way possible.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.760]   And if you've not done a thorough analysis,
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.980]   it's very possible, I would say likely,
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.900]   that you're missing and leaving money on the table,
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.180]   which you shouldn't do.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.860]   Don't leave money on the table.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.260]   Or some of you might be in a contentious situation
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.220]   where you're in a conflict, you're behind on loans,
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.780]   or you know somebody who is.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.980]   Get serious help.
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.020]   Jay's the guy to start with.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.260]   If he can help you, he'll help you.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.100]   If not, he'll refer you to somebody
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.260]   and he'll treat you right.
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.640]   And you get a discount for using my referral code.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.460]   Go to studentloanshow.com/radical,
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.140]   studentloanshow.com/radical, and check in with Jay.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.740]   And with that, here is the interview with Jim Wang.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.660]   (electronic whirring)
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.540]   Jim, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.380]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.200]   Pleasure to be here.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.220]   - So I love getting the opportunity
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.660]   to talk with guys like you.
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.960]   Having started to take an interest
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.820]   in the online world of personal finance
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.380]   back in the mid-2000s myself.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.380]   Now, 10 years later, I look back
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.560]   and see all these names of people,
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.000]   and you're one of those guys who were involved
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.540]   in the very early days of online personal finance,
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.780]   and it's a real honor to spend a little time with you.
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.860]   And I'm thrilled to bring your story to my audience.
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.660]   I'd like to start with a simple question.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.080]   You grew up rich, knew everything you needed to know
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.860]   about personal finance, and then have always been rich, right?
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.580]   What's your story with personal finance?
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.580]   - I think very few people that grow up rich
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:56.180]   sort of have good personal finance upbringings.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.420]   'Cause I mean, what's actually, it's funny you say that,
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.300]   because I think a lot of creativity
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.300]   comes out of not having a ton of money, right?
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.020]   You talk about, you think about startups.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.380]   Startups, they get a ton of funding.
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.980]   They run into a lot of problems,
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.860]   because now they have the pressure
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.860]   to have to spend this money.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.540]   A lot of problems, you turn the money to solve them.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.820]   You lose a bit of that creativity.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.100]   And while I'm not, just to set the record straight,
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.100]   didn't grow up rich.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.700]   We grew up middle class.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.020]   - There was heavy sarcasm intended in the leading question.
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.140]   - I don't wanna run past that and let everybody,
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.340]   you know, think like that. - Indeed.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.620]   - I was one of those guys that was rich and lost it all.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.420]   No, no, not like that.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.620]   But we grew up, my parents immigrated here
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.300]   in the late '70s, '78.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.540]   My dad came here on an education visa.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.660]   My mom joined him a year later.
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.340]   And then I was born about a year after that.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:58.540]   We were, I never felt like we were poor,
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.900]   though we certainly weren't rich.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.100]   Like every family, we had to make trade-offs
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.460]   on what we wanted to spend on and what we didn't.
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.260]   And one of the big things that was important for us
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.940]   is family.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.860]   And all of our family at the time was back in Taiwan.
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.100]   I mean, a lot of them are still there now.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.860]   Many also moved to California.
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.220]   But in order to see them, you'd have to get on a plane.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.300]   And if you can imagine flights,
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.340]   even today if you wanna get a flight to Taiwan,
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.380]   it's still a thousand plus dollars per person.
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.420]   - For sure.
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.580]   - You think about back in the '80s, right?
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.100]   You didn't have direct flights.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.900]   Well, I remember we had flights where,
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.660]   I grew up in New York.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.940]   New York to LA, LA to Alaska, Alaska to Japan,
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.380]   then Japan to Taiwan.
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.740]   It was over 24 hours.
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.660]   But so we would make trade-offs of what we wanted,
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.940]   which was to visit family.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.900]   And given the limited income,
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:59.100]   I think, I look back and I didn't think that we were poor
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.780]   or anything like that, but we certainly weren't rich.
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.420]   - When did you start taking an interest
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.540]   in personal finance topics?
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.700]   - I think when I started working full-time
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.780]   my dad had always sort of preached being smart with money.
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.100]   And for them, they very much wanted me and my sister
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.500]   to focus on our education because when you move here,
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.420]   education is the clearest, most guaranteed path
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.220]   towards being able to support your family,
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.620]   get a good job and sort of live that American dream.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.300]   There are so many different paths,
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.380]   but why is there always the sort of stereotype
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.580]   of Chinese kids, you should be a doctor, a lawyer,
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.460]   whatever, a lot of these professional type of degrees
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.580]   is because it's not a guarantee,
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.660]   but it's certainly better than say starting a business
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.020]   or things like that, because if you could start young
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.580]   and get that education as opposed to move here
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.380]   as an immigrant without necessarily the college degree
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.940]   or things that sort of the economics here
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.940]   will recognize as being valuable.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.060]   You know, that's more of a guarantee than anything else.
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.100]   - Definitely.
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.100]   - And so, you know, they never really talked about money.
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.460]   Like even to this day, I don't know how much my dad makes
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.300]   or my mom makes.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.540]   There's something we never talked about,
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.220]   it was sort of the adults took care of it
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.680]   and the kids, you focus on school.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.660]   The only exceptions were when I started working,
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.500]   you know, my dad said, "All right,
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.740]   we're gonna open up a Roth IRA."
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.580]   And I was like, "I don't know what this is."
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.580]   He's like, "It's for your retirement.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.660]   Don't worry about it, this is what you should do."
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.260]   And it wasn't until I started, you know,
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.980]   paying for the bills myself, sort of in college,
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.820]   not as much because there weren't that many bills.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.340]   But once you start working and you have rent and utilities,
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.180]   and now your credit cards and things like that,
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.380]   once you start paying the bills,
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.580]   you start to really care about where this money's coming
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.520]   and going because now you're sort of out of the nest, right?
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.060]   We had for the time period until I was in college,
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.860]   my parents were sort of watching
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.860]   and making sure everything was okay,
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.900]   financially and otherwise.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.700]   And once you graduate and you go out to the,
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.300]   quote unquote, "real world,"
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.340]   sort of that safety blanket's removed
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.980]   and you sort of have to learn it.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.240]   You know, I got help from my parents
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.260]   and they would explain things to me,
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.840]   but it was more like, here's real life, figure it out.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.300]   And I felt like, you know, I have to figure this out,
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.900]   otherwise things will go badly.
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.420]   - When and why did you start bargaineering?
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:36.780]   - So I started it in 2005 or four, I forget.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.380]   But I started it because I had an interest.
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.260]   So I started working in 2003, worked a couple years.
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.920]   And at the time, my girlfriend, now my wife,
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.060]   was, she had a year left in school
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.280]   and then she worked, you know, two hours away
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.560]   for another year until we moved in,
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.300]   got married, all that stuff.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.000]   And so I had all this free time at night.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.060]   Like I wasn't going out, I wasn't doing any of that stuff.
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.620]   So I said, well, what am I gonna do with this?
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.500]   So I would just read about finance stuff.
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.860]   You know, I'd go to the gym, I'd come back,
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.900]   and I wasn't really a big television watcher.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.940]   So I was like, well, what am I gonna do?
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.100]   I just started studying these different things,
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.020]   like 401ks, and you know, you get the employee manual.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.100]   And I'm like, what is all this stuff?
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.740]   And I just started getting interested in it.
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.260]   And I said, well, you know,
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.220]   I also worked in a secure environment.
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.660]   I was in the defense industry.
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.020]   So I couldn't really like take notes and things like that.
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.980]   I wanted to be able to see what I was reading
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.380]   and interpreting while I was at work.
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.380]   And so I was like, oh, why don't I start a journal?
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.580]   And I just put, well, why don't I put it on the internet?
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.120]   And my background is in computer science.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.580]   So the whole technical, sort of the light technical aspects
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.460]   of starting a blog weren't that challenging.
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.160]   So why don't I just start a blog?
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.380]   And over time, I've met other people,
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.780]   and it sort of snowballed into something bigger.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.340]   - How long did you run bargaining before the site was sold?
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.400]   - I ruled five years.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.000]   - Did you do it the entire time as a part-time endeavor,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.700]   or how much were you working on the site?
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.820]   Did you transition from day job to full-time on the site?
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.620]   What was the story there?
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.260]   - So it's funny.
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.880]   I worked on it for three years full-time.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.580]   And at the time that I quit my job,
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.060]   the site had been earning multiple of my salary,
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.940]   even though I was spending more of my hours at work.
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:39.780]   And it was interesting because I'd always associated
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.820]   sort of hard work and the actual time
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.820]   with how much money it was worth.
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.660]   Right, so I was paid a salary to go to work,
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.900]   and I enjoyed it a lot.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.020]   I was doing interesting things.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.740]   I was working with great people.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.140]   So my work situation was great.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.620]   And then I had this sort of side project
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.580]   that due to the scale of the internet was just enormous.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.460]   But I only worked a couple hours a night on it.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.900]   And near the end it started getting to be a little much
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.660]   'cause I had all this work that I wanted to do
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.740]   and only so much time.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.460]   So I started stretching it more and more at night.
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.180]   And so it got to the point where like,
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.020]   I have to spend more time on this,
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.100]   even though it's kind of a solitary effort.
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.060]   I was working on it on my own.
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.720]   I would lose the social aspect of hanging out with people
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.780]   and just chatting and whatnot.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.540]   But I remember when I called my dad
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.980]   to just ask for his advice.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.260]   I was like, oh, here's the website.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.800]   And for him, my parents are very pragmatic,
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.360]   but you can imagine, like, we put all this education.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.720]   I have a lot of degrees associated with engineering
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.140]   and computer science.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.380]   And here I was telling my dad, hey,
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.340]   all these years I spent, all this money we spent,
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.820]   I'm gonna go work on this website
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.460]   that I created three years ago.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.360]   And my dad was like, are you sure?
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.180]   And that's all he said.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.780]   I mean, he said other things, but near the end,
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:03.980]   it was just like, are you sure?
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.580]   He wasn't trying to dissuade me.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.340]   There's an understanding that due to my expertise
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.400]   and my experience and the fact that I had certain clearances
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.100]   I could get back into the work I was doing relatively easily
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.220]   as long as I didn't wait like 10 years.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.180]   But a couple of years, I could probably get back into it
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.940]   without much of a problem.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.060]   So I was like, well, if this fun little experiment fails
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.640]   in say three years, I can always go back.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   It's not a big deal.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.780]   I don't know if I could go back after,
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.980]   even now, I guess 10 years later.
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.820]   I guess it's only been seven years
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.400]   since I quit my job in '08.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:43.500]   But it was interesting when I went in to tell people
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:48.180]   because they were a little like,
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.040]   ah, it stinks you're going,
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.900]   but they were really intrigued.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.700]   Like you have this website on the side.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.660]   I was never anonymous,
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.900]   but I never shared this with my coworkers.
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.660]   It just never really came up too much.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.780]   But you're gonna quit your job in the defense industry,
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.200]   pretty stable, pretty high paying to work on a website?
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.460]   And there were thoughts like, is this porn?
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.380]   Like, are you in porn?
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.420]   I'm like, no, I'm not.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.340]   (laughing)
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.700]   But that was always the running joke
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.140]   a couple years afterwards.
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:22.980]   Like, really?
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.320]   So you work at home on a website.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:31.060]   Yeah, but it's been amazing.
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.300]   - What did you do when you went from,
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.860]   'cause you had a salary,
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.140]   and then you had, at the time that you quit,
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.700]   you were making much more than that with the website,
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.580]   and then following on,
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.260]   and we'll get to the big change
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.200]   when the site was sold later,
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.540]   but what did you do with the extra money?
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:50.600]   How did that change your life?
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.540]   Did you start spending it?
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.100]   Did you know better enough to save it?
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:53.940]   What did you do?
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.740]   - So in my mind, I had always considered
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.900]   the salary that I was earning
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.500]   was essentially buying time in the future.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.620]   So I thought, all right,
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.900]   if let's say it made three times my salary that year,
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.940]   or five times, whatever it is,
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.820]   I was buying three to five years of just experimentation.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.620]   Like, that was my psychological thinking
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.220]   in being able to quit a stable job, right?
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.620]   You can either trade an income stream
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.600]   that theoretically will be until I retire,
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.460]   say 30 or 40 years,
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.760]   for this sort of less stable,
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.620]   little riskier stream that's three or five times more,
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.340]   but may disappear in a year.
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.360]   So my thinking was, I'm just essentially,
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.700]   present value of my future.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.580]   I was saying, all right,
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.800]   I can screw around for the next five years
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.080]   with this money as my income.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.120]   So I saved it all.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.220]   I saved as much as I could.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.780]   I didn't buy anything extravagant.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.220]   And I put a lot, as much as I could,
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.500]   into a SEP IRA,
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.540]   and just tried to reinvest as much as I could
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.900]   back into the business,
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.980]   to the extent that I knew how to.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.580]   But the rest just went into savings.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.220]   - So I read in an online,
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.380]   in a Forbes article, profile of you,
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.660]   that you ran bargaineering for five years,
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.980]   and then ultimately it was sold for about $3 million.
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.380]   You don't have to confirm or deny that.
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.540]   I read it on the internet, so it must be true.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.020]   That's a big difference as far as a financial situation,
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.920]   where you go from earning a salary as an engineer,
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.160]   to having a really nice windfall.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.340]   Facing that situation,
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.100]   what did you do when the checks started clearing?
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:40.220]   - I didn't do anything yet.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.420]   Like, I waited a couple months.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.140]   - To see if the money was gonna disappear
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.620]   out of the bank account. (laughs)
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.460]   - It wasn't so much that.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.900]   It was just like, you kinda,
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.700]   my feeling was like, you have to kinda sit with it
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.300]   for a little bit,
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.780]   and kinda not make any sort of rash decisions,
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:57.980]   and any guesses.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.320]   I remember,
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.300]   I remember riding the train back home,
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.940]   and realizing that that had happened.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.780]   I was like, wow, this is not at all what I had expected
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.260]   when I first started it.
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.180]   This is really cool.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.140]   Well, part of me was also like,
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.900]   what am I gonna do next,
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.500]   in terms of professional career?
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.700]   - Because that was your whole life at that time.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.620]   - Yeah, it was everything.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.020]   And we could talk about sort of like,
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.860]   the emotional challenges that came a little after that.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.340]   But, you know, initially I was just like,
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.940]   I'm just gonna sit with this, wait for a little bit,
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:41.660]   and then maybe talk to some professionals
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.860]   to see if there's something I'm not getting.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.900]   And yeah, a lot of it has to just do with comfort
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.100]   with the fact that it's such a large number.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.260]   Right, like when you think about it,
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.900]   if that's all invested in the stock market,
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.420]   you know, 1% for most people,
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.460]   if you have 100 grand in the stock market,
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.940]   it goes down 1%, that's $1,000.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.100]   That's, you could swallow that.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:04.940]   - Right. - You could be like,
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.820]   oh, okay, this is something I'm not gonna touch
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.100]   for 30 years.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.700]   Well, if you're in the millions and it goes down 1%,
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.900]   now you're talking sums that would equate
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.340]   to annual salaries.
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.620]   - Right, right.
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.180]   - Like there were times when the stock market
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:23.100]   was going up and down in 2008 where it was like
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.480]   how much I would have made in a single year,
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.140]   that first year I was working.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.340]   And it was like, it's something you just gotta deal with.
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.020]   And you sort of get comfortable with it over time
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.980]   because you realize, you know, trough to peak,
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.980]   it's no more than a couple years.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.400]   And if you're looking at it for 20 years,
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.640]   you're like, all right, this is gonna happen
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.960]   probably a couple more times, don't freak out.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.360]   But yeah, it's, I don't know if I'm still comfortable
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.640]   with it, and actually I'm certain I'm still not comfortable
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.180]   with it, but I just tell myself, don't touch it.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.680]   Just let it be there.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.000]   Have an insurance plan in place if everything
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.600]   goes to sort of crap, but don't freak out.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.440]   - What was the emotional journey like
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.600]   over the last five or six years?
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.240]   - So the emotional journey, this is the thing
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.120]   that sort of caught me off guard,
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:24.120]   was oftentimes we associate our worth
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.720]   with maybe how much we make, but also what we're doing.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.320]   You couple that with, I very much need something
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.720]   to be working on, or I need to be working on something.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.240]   And so for the longest time I was working on bargainering.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.720]   Waking up, getting excited, jumping out of bed.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.480]   I had this laundry list of things that I wanted to do.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.000]   Wasn't things that I was forced to do, I wanted to do it,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.240]   and I was excited to think about how am I gonna overcome
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.880]   all these challenges.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.520]   And then overnight, it was like gone.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.920]   There's the old adage, no one washes a rental car.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.720]   Well, now I was in charge of a rental car,
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.720]   and while I was still invested financially,
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.000]   but also emotionally, it wasn't the same.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.440]   I have two kids.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.720]   I wonder if that sort of emptiness will happen
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.120]   when kids go off to college and graduate
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.080]   and start living their own lives.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.000]   You spend all this time always thinking about
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.240]   making sure they're okay, building them up, all that stuff.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.440]   And then that responsibility disappearing could be jarring.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.880]   But yeah, so for a couple months, weeks or months,
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.520]   I can't exactly recall.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.200]   I just felt a little empty.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.240]   And while I wouldn't say I was depressed,
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.480]   a lot of people describe depression as not so much sadness
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.180]   but an emptiness.
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.840]   And that's sort of what I felt in the closest that I think
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.600]   that I have been to being depressed.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.280]   But at least I sort of understood
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.480]   the thing that caused it.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.480]   But yeah, but after that, I started finding other projects
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.160]   that I was interested in, and I started working on those,
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.020]   and they sort of filled in that space for me.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:15.520]   - Did you ever, so it's obvious by the way that you speak,
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.560]   by your professional education resume,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.040]   that at least you come across as very engineering,
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.480]   which is awesome.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.760]   - Is that good?
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.640]   - It's a great thing.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.760]   I mean, engineers are some of the most productive creators
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.120]   and accumulators of wealth because the careful personality,
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.080]   the controlled emotions, the logical mind,
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.380]   those skill sets when transferred over
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.120]   to financial management are really, really,
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.760]   really, really valuable.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.640]   But I gotta ask, did you at some point pop the relief valve
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.100]   and buy something fun?
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:55.360]   - No, I don't know.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.440]   - Nothing, not a car, a house?
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.880]   - But it wasn't related to that.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.480]   It was because we needed a little more room.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.600]   We were in a townhouse, and we bought a house
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.600]   that now in the Washington, D.C. area had 11 acres.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.360]   So we, you know, granted, as I think back,
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.560]   would we have bought the house we're living in now
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.480]   if I was still working in the defense industry
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.640]   that I probably wouldn't have?
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:29.240]   But that's really the only extravagant thing.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:35.040]   Yeah, I wonder, so my wife very much loves
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.720]   to celebrate little wins, and I know that celebrating wins
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.480]   is a very healthy thing to do.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.880]   I just have never felt the need to.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.100]   Like, I'm just like, oh, this is a good result.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.600]   You know what it is?
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.480]   It is the engineer.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.140]   It's the, you focus on the process
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.400]   and not necessarily the result,
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.520]   because the result can be a function
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.960]   of a variety of things, and it's your process
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.140]   that you need to sort of hone in and get right.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.120]   And sometimes it doesn't work out
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.340]   due to things that are out of your control.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.040]   And I think my thinking is just, you know,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.680]   I'm focusing on the process.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.280]   And, you know, it's not like we don't,
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.360]   we do enjoy it in the sense that we go on vacations
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:23.360]   and things like that, but nothing really crazy.
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.780]   - At this point in time, I know you--
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:27.620]   - Should I?
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.860]   You're the professional here.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:29.700]   (laughing)
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.700]   I'm just the engineer pretending to be a financial guy.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.740]   - I think it's almost a balance,
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.780]   and the reason I'm probing so hard on this,
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.680]   and I appreciate your candor, is because this is
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.680]   a conversation that rarely happens in the public space.
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:55.220]   Many people, me included, many people who,
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.040]   me included in the past, who are working
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.200]   toward a financial goal, what happens is we tend
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.680]   to set our sights on the financial goal.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.720]   For me, the most striking thing was when I had set a goal
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.880]   of getting out of debt, and I put that
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.560]   as my number one goal, I put that as a primary focus,
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.560]   I put that as a very high goal, and I achieved it.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:23.900]   And then I was left with that almost sense of loss,
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.900]   of saying, well, what do I do now?
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.460]   Where do I go from here?
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.940]   What's the next thing?
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.700]   And I tried to put the goal then,
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.040]   and set the next financial goal on an income goal,
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.860]   or a savings goal, and I achieved some of those things
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.780]   as well, and I still had that sense of, wait a second,
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.220]   this is the wrong thing.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.700]   And then I started paying attention to what,
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.900]   I guess I just started, because I was coming through
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.940]   that sense of dissatisfaction with actually achieving
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.660]   the goal, I started to analyze it and realize
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.860]   that what I really enjoyed was the work,
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.420]   was the process, was that sense of focus,
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.620]   that sense of clear perspective.
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.540]   And I came to a couple of conclusions for myself,
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:09.140]   that money is a terrible goal, there may be things
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.180]   along the way that can be bought with money,
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.500]   that can be helpful, a little bit fulfilling,
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.560]   give a sense of value and of purpose,
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.660]   but money is a terrible goal.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.660]   You might think it means a little bit different,
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.980]   you might think that looking at numbers on a spreadsheet
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.680]   is gonna, or in your bank account,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.420]   is gonna be satisfying, and it is a little bit.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.460]   Right now, I've got more money in my checking account
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.220]   right now, due to selling some investments
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.920]   and repositioning all of my finances for the next stage
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.460]   of my personal finance plan, I got more money
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.260]   sitting in my checking account than I've ever had.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.020]   I'm sitting there looking at it, but it's like,
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.980]   okay, well I always dreamed of being able to look
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.940]   at that number there, but realistically,
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.060]   it's not, it's just a number.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.680]   And so I purpose to focus on the process
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.080]   and focus on the journey, and I thought that
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:02.080]   the best encapsulation of it was who, I guess,
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.440]   Jim Rohn popularized it, but where he talks about
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.340]   the most important thing of becoming a millionaire
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.560]   is not having a million dollars.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.860]   The most important thing of becoming a millionaire
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.880]   is becoming a millionaire, becoming the type of person
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.540]   who accumulates a million dollars.
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.600]   And then once you're there, that's one reason why
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.540]   the rich continually get richer and the poor
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.040]   continually get poorer, is the first million
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.860]   really is the hardest, because the person
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.460]   that you've gotta become to go from zero to a million
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.160]   dollars is very different than the person
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.240]   who starts at zero and stays at zero.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.320]   But once you're the kind of person who puts together
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   a million dollars, well, to add another million dollars,
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.180]   you're already that person, so you've already
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.800]   accomplished that personal transformation,
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.940]   those character development, that skill set,
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.120]   that stability, that careful approach,
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.120]   all of those skills that go into it.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:55.120]   And so I guess I determined to always set my goals longer
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.320]   and to always be thinking about the next things
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.000]   and not to tie my goals to financial,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.900]   not to tie them to finance.
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.700]   It's good to have financial benchmarks,
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.420]   but I don't have any monetary financial goals.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.560]   My goals are about who I am and who I want to be
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.200]   and what I want to do, and then I need specific
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.460]   benchmarks along the way for those,
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.360]   to make sure that I'm on track and I'm not fooling myself
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.260]   toward the accomplishment of my goals.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:27.080]   - Yeah, if you have, I'm very much a systems
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.720]   versus goals type of person, and what's funny
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.940]   is I recently stumbled upon Douglas Adams' blog
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.560]   and his book, Douglas Adams, the same guy
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.200]   that made Dilbert, and he's a really--
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.380]   - Scott Adams. - Scott Adams.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.220]   - Sorry, yeah.
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.060]   - Okay.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.820]   I grabbed my pen and I was writing Douglas Adams,
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.660]   I never heard of this guy.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.760]   - I also love Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.620]   to the Galaxy, his books too.
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.920]   Scott Adams, yeah, sorry about that.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.240]   But he writes a lot about sort of the things
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.480]   that he's discovered going through life,
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.980]   and one of them is the idea of systems versus goals.
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.300]   And it basically echoes what you were saying,
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.660]   like goals are tricky because it doesn't actually
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.860]   talk about how you get there.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.460]   Right, it's like, oh, I wanna make a million dollars,
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.340]   or I wanna have a million, or whatever,
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.220]   and it's like, well, how are we actually gonna do it?
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.160]   Well, that's actually the system that you put into place.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.780]   Well, before you can get the system into place,
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.380]   you have to figure out how are you gonna develop
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.980]   the habits, right, how do you become the millionaire
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.540]   before you actually have a million bucks
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:32.540]   on your balance sheet, and that's,
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.500]   a lot of the things, his book is really good
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.060]   for a lot of those sort of, those thinking type of ideas.
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.140]   But yeah, I fully agree.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.780]   I mean, goals are what makes you do silly things,
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.220]   like, oh, I want to have a net worth of a million dollars
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.860]   by the end of the year, so you start doing all these
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.180]   like, you know, financial engineering type of things
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.160]   to make it happen, when in reality, like, does it matter?
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.760]   Not really, it's good to have a goal,
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.660]   but it's a system that's much more important.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.860]   - I also think it's important to recognize
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.220]   that from what I hear from your story
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.620]   is that your character, your personality,
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.980]   the skills and habits that you've put in place,
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.680]   those are the things that have allowed you to enjoy
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.380]   and benefit from sudden wealth, a windfall event,
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.020]   rather than to be destroyed by it.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.900]   Because I guess the person who best encapsulated it
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.820]   was T Harv, years ago I read T Harv Eker's book,
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:30.780]   "Secrets of the Millionaire Mind",
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.540]   and he made a big point about talking about
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.340]   the concept of the money thermostat,
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.860]   the idea that we all have a comfort level.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.260]   Some people have a comfort level
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.180]   of zero dollars in their bank account.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.100]   Some people have a comfort level of $1,000.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.340]   Some people have 10,000.
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.660]   Some people have hundreds of thousands.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.100]   Some people have millions of dollars.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.260]   And as you described, it can take a little while
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.820]   when there's a sudden change, upward or downward,
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.660]   it can take a little while to adjust our self-image,
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:59.780]   our perception of ourself, to that different number.
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.620]   The example I use is, let's say Donald Trump woke up
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.300]   and found himself with 10 million bucks in the bank.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.060]   Would he be rejoicing at the fact
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.060]   that he has $10 million in the bank?
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:14.700]   He would be horrified, and he would immediately cancel
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.420]   anything, he would cancel his presidential campaign
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.500]   and say, "I've gotta make some money."
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.260]   Because his self-image, his financial thermostat,
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.580]   is set in the billions of dollars.
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.100]   That's where he's comfortable.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.300]   Whereas many of us, if we woke up with $10 million,
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.060]   I don't know, if I woke up all of a sudden
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.260]   with $10 million in the bank,
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.060]   and I hadn't gone through the process
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.660]   of gradually adjusting my comfort level
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.140]   and my self-image to that place,
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.500]   I might do something stupid and get rid of it.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.180]   Hopefully I wouldn't, but it's a real danger.
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.180]   And it describes why character and planning
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:53.180]   and structure is so important for us
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.040]   to build into ourselves, so that when we come
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.660]   into those windfall events, instead of destroying our lives,
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.500]   they can enhance our lives.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.700]   - Yeah, and I also think that, as you talk
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.060]   about the thermostat, there are lessons
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:10.580]   that you learn managing 10,000, 50,000, 100,
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.800]   before you get to the million.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.780]   And those things, while they'll also move your thermostat
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.860]   and your comfort level, they also give you
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:22.020]   the information and skills, so that when you do
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:25.900]   get the windfall, it's not as crazy of an event.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.040]   And you don't, like you say, do something foolish.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.240]   I mean, 'cause before, it wasn't like the lottery,
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.260]   where one day there was seven figures
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.000]   in a bank account somewhere.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.860]   The site had been generating significant income up to then,
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.760]   and so I still had to figure out,
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.480]   I can contribute this much to my retirement accounts
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.560]   and this and that, and how I should invest it
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.040]   in the allocation of things.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.720]   So it wasn't as big of a shock for that reason also.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.480]   - Have you been able to find good financial advice
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.280]   at this point, since you've achieved
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.440]   almost a different perspective in life?
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.120]   Have you found a good financial advisor
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.400]   or trusted advisors to work with you?
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.920]   - We have a financial advisor.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.420]   She's fee-only.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.120]   We don't do any investments with her,
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:18.120]   and she's sort of just, is someone that can act
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.880]   as a sounding board for ideas, and just sort of
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.760]   has an eye on where we're going and making sure
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:28.040]   that our future needs are funded in some way.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.660]   But we don't actually have any investments with her.
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.920]   - When you started, you were primarily, I think,
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.960]   focusing on just basic personal finance topics.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.840]   That was, as I understand it,
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.120]   that was kind of just the standard approach,
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.960]   starting with basic personal finance topics,
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.200]   money management, budgeting, debt, credit cards,
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.260]   just the standard, basic level.
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.040]   You're now at a different financial position.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.440]   I'd like to know, what was the theme, I guess,
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.140]   that continued forward, that has come forward
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.200]   over the last 10 years, where you started talking
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.800]   and writing about 10 years ago versus where you are today?
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.080]   What's the same?
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.460]   And also, what's different?
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.480]   What were you talking about then that now,
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.360]   in retrospect, you see is very different
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.020]   in your current place in life?
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:20.440]   - I think now, what's different now is a bigger focus.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.360]   So, what's different now, yeah, is a bigger focus
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.320]   on sort of the systems and developing good habits,
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.080]   as opposed to in the past, say 10 years ago,
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.320]   I might be writing about how to save money on X,
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:38.220]   and it would be maybe a service or something like that.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.740]   And it was very much shorter term than it is today.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.360]   I think today, I try to just figure out how, yeah,
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.360]   how to install systems so I can spend more time
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.480]   on things that are more valuable to me
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.040]   and worry less about the sort of the hardcore,
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.040]   like money-saving things where you're trading
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.840]   a lot of time for money and things of that nature.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:05.120]   I think it's because, I've also gotten older.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.540]   When you're in your early 20s, you have nothing but time.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:12.720]   Now, I'm in my 30s, my time is valuable
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.400]   because there's so many different competing interests.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.320]   And so, a lot of things I try to put into place
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.800]   are to make sure that I'm still on top of my money,
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.220]   but without spending a ton of time doing it.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:28.460]   - You, based upon your birth story
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.340]   and your parents immigrating into the United States,
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.640]   you're in a very interesting position
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.080]   of observing your parents,
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.600]   who are immigrants to a different culture,
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.440]   but then you basically growing up
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.220]   within the US American culture.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.920]   When you look at the difference between
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.120]   mainstream US American culture and traditional Asian culture,
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:54.720]   what are the things that, with regard to wealth,
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.000]   stand out as being the most crazy to you about US Americans?
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.440]   And what are the things that you perhaps value
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.460]   from your traditional Asian culture?
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:11.320]   - So, I've thought about this a little bit,
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.380]   and my thinking is,
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:18.040]   I don't know if this applies to traditional Asian cultures
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.560]   or just to my parents and family,
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.820]   but if you think about when the Depression
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.400]   was in the United States,
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:30.400]   and then you think about when the Cultural Revolution
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.480]   and World War II, that whole era in China and Taiwan,
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.860]   you have the need for frugality
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:44.200]   differs by 30 years, 20 years, something like that.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.300]   So, it's basically one generation.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.100]   So, if you think back, in American culture,
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.420]   if you think back to your grandparents,
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:55.380]   or maybe your grandparents, and how frugal they are,
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.420]   it's sort of like how my parents are today.
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:02.260]   And you have that sort of development.
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.100]   Like, when you live in an era
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.880]   where you have to like scrimp everything
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.740]   when you're a child, that sticks with you.
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.820]   Those are habits that you develop
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.080]   that are gonna continue on.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.860]   And so, my parents were very frugal,
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.820]   'cause they came here, and they were saving up
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.540]   so we could go visit home,
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.620]   and we would shut off the electricity,
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.420]   or shut off the heat at night,
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.780]   and just bundle up in blankets.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.700]   And we lived in New York, and it got cold at night.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.380]   Just sort of the things that you would do.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.740]   And if you think back to a lot of folks' grandparents,
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.900]   that's probably what they did too, during that era.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.100]   So, I think that's probably the biggest analogy
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.260]   that can help folks understand
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.080]   why certain groups are frugal.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.400]   You just think about when they had
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.480]   sort of a significant belt-tightening moment,
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.880]   and it often translates.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.600]   I don't know if there's anything too crazy.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.160]   I do know that one of the,
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.440]   maybe the big disadvantages I had
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.360]   was in not having more of a financial education.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.600]   And I don't know if anybody else
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.800]   had a better financial education.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:11.340]   But money isn't just something
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.940]   that you should be saving all the time.
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.200]   Like, you should be investing it.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.500]   You should be thinking about ways
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.380]   of making it grow and work for you.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.660]   And that just, money can be seen
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.700]   as sort of like this living thing,
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.900]   and not just an asset to be consumed or saved.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.840]   And that's just something that took me a while to understand.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.780]   And part of it was through blogging
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.100]   and talking with more people, and saying,
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.740]   all right, so there's a certain group of people
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:35.780]   that they take this money,
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.400]   and they're investing in the stock market,
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.380]   or they're putting it into real estate.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.680]   And it's not so much like a gamble as it is,
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:47.140]   you spread it out and try to make it grow,
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.540]   and not just put it all in one thing
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.500]   and look for an awesome deal or something like that.
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.060]   So, yeah, I don't know if I answered that
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.900]   or if I just started rambling, but--
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.700]   - How old are your children now, Jim?
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.180]   - They're four and two.
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:02.440]   - What's your plan for their financial education?
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.000]   - Good question.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.860]   I don't currently have one.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:12.860]   Though, I mean, I imagine it'll evolve as they get older.
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.420]   I do know that every so often my son, who's four,
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.260]   will come in and say,
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.820]   hey, I wanna sell you this thing, whatever.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.420]   It'll be like a block.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.260]   I'm like, sell?
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:24.080]   Where'd you learn to sell?
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.540]   He's like, I don't know, but I wanna sell it to you.
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.380]   I was like, how much?
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.980]   He was like, $1.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:30.820]   Like, that's it, just $1?
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.380]   He's like, $3.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.100]   I'm like, okay, fine, $3.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.440]   I don't know, we'll just grow it from there.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:43.440]   But I think that he'll probably, I don't know.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.720]   How should I do it?
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.120]   - Well. (laughs)
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:53.440]   - They're young, so it's, are they young?
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.280]   You tell me.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.440]   Are they too young yet?
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.720]   - So, I'll recognize, I've got a two-year-old
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.760]   and a six-month-old, so we're at similar stages.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   I've perhaps spent maybe more time thinking about it
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.160]   because it's important to me,
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.420]   and I'm gonna be doing a bunch of shows
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.420]   on radical personal finance in the future
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:12.160]   on my own ideas and plans, and I've been studying,
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.000]   I've been studying many people,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.880]   and success stories, failure stories.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.600]   I guess the biggest thing is to recognize
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.400]   that the axiom, or the aphorism, I'm not sure
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.240]   which is the appropriate word,
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.280]   the saying is, shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.760]   in three generations, and that is your biggest danger.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.720]   As an affluent father, your parents sacrificed
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.800]   to come to the US.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.680]   They raised you with frugality.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.600]   You've taken that frugality, used those habits
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:45.020]   and that character to pass on and build wealth.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:47.280]   Now, the danger is, usually by the third generation,
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.640]   the third generation doesn't see,
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.200]   you saw the sacrifice of your parents' generation.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.740]   Your kids aren't gonna grow up seeing you sacrifice.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.000]   You're gonna live in a nice house,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.480]   you're gonna enjoy the fruits of your labor.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.400]   They're not gonna see the sacrifice.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.920]   And so, what happens is they tend not
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.360]   to value things as much, and most parents,
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.680]   number one, parents tend, we have a tendency
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.300]   toward indulging our children, and those with means
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.360]   have a tendency to indulge more than those without.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.080]   And so, it's a big, big concern.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:25.080]   In my mind, the key is to mold and shape their character
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:28.880]   and build their education and their skills.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.800]   And the way to do it is gonna be different
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.640]   within each family.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.280]   I think it's important to, my personal opinion is,
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.420]   I think it's important to maintain
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.560]   some austerity in their lives.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.120]   It's nice to be able to enjoy the fruits of wealth,
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:47.640]   but there should not be, in order to build
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.840]   similar character and hunger into our children,
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.880]   they can't be indulged to the point
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.820]   of having everything they want without work.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.000]   That doesn't mean you can just ignore
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.520]   the status that we have in life.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.040]   All of us are affluent on a global scale,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.440]   but the question is how do we build an appreciation
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.960]   in them and build that character and form it
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.840]   in them in an appropriate way,
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.880]   and then how do we involve them in our family finances?
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.120]   Because there's, based upon what you're describing,
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.920]   unless you were to go through some radical change,
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.160]   I mean, your children are going to come
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.960]   into the stewardship of very large amounts of wealth.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.480]   Unless you make foolish investments
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.160]   or somehow spend the money or give it all away,
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.240]   they're going to come into the possession
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.520]   of very large amounts of wealth.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.800]   And so the biggest financial challenge you have
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.640]   is to shape and mold their character
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.600]   so that it doesn't destroy their lives.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.560]   - So you know, it's interesting.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.320]   So when you asked me what we're doing,
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.120]   I was thinking strictly in sort of the financial education
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.200]   sort of arena of skills of what we teach.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.960]   And so while we're too early for that,
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.560]   I think now is obviously the prime time
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.440]   for the character building grit
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.640]   and being able to persevere sort of through adversity.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.040]   And we try to do that.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.000]   You know, we try to instill good habits
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.320]   of like making your bed and cleaning your room
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.840]   and things like that where you start off early.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.240]   And it's already paying off dividends for us
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.880]   just because now there's areas
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.480]   that he'll pick up after himself.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.280]   And yeah, so we're trying to teach him more
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:28.280]   how to be like a decent to good human being.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.120]   And hopefully the actual concrete financial lessons
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.720]   will come later.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.640]   But yeah, it's tough 'cause they have their own opinions
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.120]   and it's a tendency of all human beings to be lazy,
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.440]   especially when your parents are there.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.280]   - Definitely.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.520]   And it's, yeah, absolutely.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.760]   You have been involved since leaving bargaining,
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.280]   you've been involved in various other online endeavors.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.560]   And specifically I'd like to ask you
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.080]   about the world of blogging.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.040]   Today I see many people,
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.600]   especially in the personal finance situation, sphere,
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.560]   who are building blogs and they're primarily doing it
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:09.320]   in order to build an income for themselves.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.000]   And I'm guilty of the same thing.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.100]   I built Radical Personal Finance with the intention,
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.080]   I experimented a little bit,
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.040]   and then I've built it with the intention
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.820]   of providing an income for me
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.840]   based upon talking about finance topics.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.480]   Share with me what,
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:27.240]   is what happened in your situation duplicatable
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.840]   today in 2016?
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.160]   - Oh yeah.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.040]   I think everything that anyone's really ever done
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.760]   is duplicatable, not necessarily in the same way.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.720]   Like you can build up an internet property,
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.000]   a website, a blog, whatever you wanna call it,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.480]   so that it's valuable to someone else
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.880]   and then sell it for a large sum.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:52.240]   Is it, was it, will it be as easy as before?
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.080]   I don't know.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.400]   I guess you would define,
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.480]   you'd have to define what easy is.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.280]   But if you work hard enough,
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.760]   I think that anyone can build sort of a following
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.040]   and then either sell products or sell their own products
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.400]   or someone else's products to that audience.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.520]   And yeah, I don't see why not.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.160]   I mean, I'm trying to do it again, in part because,
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.160]   so one of the things that prompted me
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.960]   to start bargaining in the first place,
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.240]   or actually one of the reasons why it started making money
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.560]   was because I started seeing affiliate links
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:27.520]   and the sort of puzzle solving gene in me
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.200]   or whatever you wanna call it, part of my brain said,
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.320]   what is this?
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.840]   How can I figure this out?
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.720]   I'm very much fascinated by how other systems work
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.880]   and reverse engineering them.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.120]   Like there's the engineer again.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.080]   And I think even today,
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.920]   maybe the methods are slightly different,
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.760]   but it's still definitely possible.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.800]   You just have to spend the time,
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.240]   study what other people are doing,
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.920]   copy them and then innovate on it
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.720]   in order to sort of take it beyond
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.040]   where they're able to take it.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.800]   - Many times in growth phases,
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.160]   there's a factor of individual skill
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.400]   and there's a factor of fortuitous timing.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.800]   For example, you can look at various investors
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:11.240]   in the stock market and some component of their results
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:14.400]   might be based upon the generalized market trend.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.040]   I had a 30 year bull market trend
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.920]   and so that helped you to look like a better investor
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.400]   and some of it may be based upon their individual skill.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.280]   Looking back at bargaining,
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.800]   if you were gonna guess a percentage of your success
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.480]   and assign a percentage to your own personal skill,
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.640]   uniqueness in the niche versus the general trend
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.720]   of growth of online personal finance blogs,
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.640]   how would you break those numbers out?
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.720]   - Good question.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:45.720]   I would probably 20% timing, 80% personal.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.680]   I think, and in the personal aspect,
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.440]   there's, as we talked about our kids
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.000]   and grit and perseverance,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.800]   like part of that is just sticking around long enough.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.600]   And granted, start to finish of five years
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.040]   is not quote unquote long at all,
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.680]   but there are plenty of blogs that quit out
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.320]   in the first year, first six months.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.320]   So, I mean, 80% skill, I would like to say, 90, 70.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.000]   It's hard to assign numbers
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.360]   to what is essentially a qualitative thing.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.000]   But I mean, if you look, so if you look towards today
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.540]   and compare the experience now and then,
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.560]   I would say the 20% then was the fortunate timing
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:36.460]   of how much easier it was to do search engine optimization.
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:40.320]   And remember, search engine optimization,
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:44.680]   how high you're listed on Google search results
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.240]   now is gonna be a lot harder
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.240]   in part because of how they do the rankings
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.560]   in the first place, but also how many more sites there are
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.360]   and how many more high quality sites
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.240]   writing about similar things.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.240]   These days though, the technology exists
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.600]   that you can build a following,
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.880]   a much closer following, a tribe, what have you,
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.280]   more easily than you did five years ago
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.480]   or even 10 years ago.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.720]   So there's always going to be something, right?
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.940]   There's going to be a bull market somewhere.
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:17.260]   And now in terms of building a business or a blog,
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:21.180]   you have to find out where your efforts are best put.
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:26.880]   - When did you recognize in your journey,
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.200]   as you started it just as, okay,
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.840]   I'm gonna scratch this personal itch,
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:31.680]   write about these things,
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.560]   when did you recognize that you were in a rising market?
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.960]   - I think when, so I started it in January
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.660]   and then in September, I was in the New York Times
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:47.560]   on like a Sunday edition photo,
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.720]   what was it, Sunday of their business, I don't know.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.320]   But I was like, whoa, I could start a blog
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:56.600]   and get my picture in the New York Times.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.560]   I'm not a financial professional.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:03.120]   There's really no reason I should be here
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.280]   other than this is an article
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.560]   about people sharing their net worths.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.560]   And that's when I was like, oh, this is gonna be a thing.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.960]   And even though it didn't make any money,
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.880]   I guess I made money off ads,
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:19.160]   but it wasn't like a financial windfall by any means.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.520]   But it was sort of something that said,
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.940]   hey, blogs are for real.
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:27.160]   Even though for years people had joked about
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.220]   people sharing their journals and how boring they were.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:33.200]   Sort of like how they started in the beginning of Twitter,
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.320]   right, when they're like, oh, you're sharing
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.920]   what you had for breakfast, awesome, no one cares.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.480]   And then a bunch of celebrities go on
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.560]   and now they're publicly traded,
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:41.960]   although not doing that great.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.840]   But still, this is a service that has people
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.280]   share 140 characters, like what is this?
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:52.200]   - The reason I was pressing on that is a trick question,
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.960]   is to develop a theme, I guess just an opinion I have.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:57.080]   And I wanted to hear it from you,
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.460]   'cause I was like, test my opinions on other people.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:02.080]   But I would say that,
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.740]   so my way of answering the trick question is,
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.380]   I think 100% of your, well, I would say 99%
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:11.020]   of your success was skill, and part of that skill
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:13.020]   was being able to recognize the timing
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:15.120]   of what was going on in the market.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:18.220]   Because if you hadn't looked and seen,
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.740]   okay, I've been doing this for two or three years,
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:22.580]   let's say you'd done it for three years
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.680]   and you weren't getting any traction,
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.560]   you looked around and nobody was reading finance blogs
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.280]   and that New York Times article hadn't happened,
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.500]   then you wouldn't have continued doing it.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.980]   So I think recognizing timing is a skill,
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:37.540]   and paying attention to the industries
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.100]   and the things that you're involved in,
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:40.280]   part of that is a skill.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:45.260]   Now we can't control the macro trend of timing necessarily.
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:48.260]   We can't control the fact that we live in the digital age
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.620]   where we're able to create this digital content
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.140]   and influence other people.
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:55.300]   We can't control that, but we can recognize what's going on.
[00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:57.220]   And I've done the same thing with Radical Personal Finance.
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:59.740]   When I was, I started it just a little bit,
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:02.580]   podcasts, we're in the wave of podcasting,
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:04.540]   where more people are starting podcasts,
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.020]   more people are, it's a hot new thing.
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.380]   A couple years ago when I went to FinCon
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:09.860]   within our industry, everyone's,
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:10.980]   okay, I've got to get into podcasting,
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:12.400]   got to get into podcasting.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.860]   Well, part of the skill for me, I'm convinced,
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.020]   is I was watching that and I said,
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:20.900]   I see the next wave because I'm my best consumer,
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.140]   I know what's coming, and I've got to start now
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.900]   with my own podcast journey.
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.780]   I've got to take the leap because I see the trend
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:30.140]   in the wave that's coming.
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:31.820]   And I think this is something that we've got
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.500]   to pay attention to in our careers,
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.060]   whether it's a digital career,
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:38.480]   whether it's something else, in any business,
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.700]   this is an applicable lesson.
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.040]   Can you time the market?
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.440]   Can I time the market?
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.460]   I can't, I don't have the interest or the connection
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:51.060]   to pay attention to it, to the generalized stock market
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.380]   on that much of an interest.
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.840]   But I can time my market if I pay attention.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.980]   I can know my industry, whatever that industry is,
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.580]   I can search for the trends, I can stay plugged in.
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:05.460]   And that can be something that draws a major difference
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:07.380]   in my growth rate in my career.
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.380]   And I think it's important for my audience
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:12.580]   to recognize that and apply it to their career,
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:15.080]   whether it's a blog, whether it's a podcast,
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.620]   or whether it's owning tire stores
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:19.660]   and car repair stores or whatever.
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.500]   Always staying tuned and saying,
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.420]   what's the generalized trend?
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:26.900]   And how can I take my unique, specific advantages
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:29.940]   and apply them over to the generalized trend?
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.820]   I tried to start a personal finance blog back in 2000
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.820]   and about six or seven.
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.460]   I launched the site, I posted some articles,
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.780]   I would sit down on a Sunday night and I would try to write.
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.680]   But writing is not my skill set.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.500]   And at that time, I didn't have enough content
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:46.780]   or material where it flowed.
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.020]   And so I shuttered the blog, took it offline,
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:50.540]   and went on.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.420]   But when you recognize the intersection between your skills,
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:58.420]   your ability, your interests, and the generalized trend,
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:03.300]   and so for you, if that was writing, for me, it's speaking,
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.900]   that's where a major growth can occur in our careers.
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.060]   I just, I don't know.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.860]   You agree, disagree?
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:10.860]   - I totally agree.
[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.760]   Also, a couple things I wanted to share.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:17.760]   So I had to take the SAT2 writing exam to get into college.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.380]   It was actually required by Carnegie Mellon,
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.300]   even though I was going into computer science,
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.180]   like they required it.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.020]   I guess they wanted us to be semi-well-rounded.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.940]   And I couldn't write.
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.300]   Like, I was terrible at writing.
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.900]   I was a typical engineer.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.820]   And I mean, I did fine on the SAT verbal,
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:39.540]   'cause that's just definitions and whatever it used to be.
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.220]   But writing, I had to get a tutor,
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.900]   and I don't know what I scored.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:45.700]   It was like 500-something out of 800.
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:46.660]   I still got into college,
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:50.000]   so I guess the bar wasn't particularly high.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.220]   So I wasn't a good writer,
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.060]   but I became better the more I did it.
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:56.820]   Like any other skill, you get better as you do it.
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:55:01.820]   But to go back to your whole starting a blog
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.540]   and deciding it's not for you,
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.020]   like I'm sure you learned things from that experience
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.020]   that helped when you started Radical.
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:08.860]   - Definitely.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.740]   - You didn't have to figure out how to register a domain
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.980]   and get hosting, and you were able to get that,
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.340]   which far less friction.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:17.100]   And then you were then able to focus
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.140]   on the thing that you wanted to do,
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:21.020]   which was record and publish podcasts.
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:23.260]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:24.460]   - I totally agree.
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:26.740]   - And that's why just experimenting
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:27.900]   and trying different things.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.780]   Today, everyone should have a blog.
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:30.900]   Everyone should have a podcast.
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:32.260]   Everyone should have a YouTube video
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.820]   because the process of creating it
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:36.060]   will teach you something,
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.660]   and then you'll be more well-equipped
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:39.060]   where when you identify the thing
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:41.420]   that's appropriate for you, it's not the first time.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:42.580]   It's a whole new skill set,
[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:44.300]   and this skill set is important
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.580]   to start building before you need it.
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:47.620]   - Exactly.
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.980]   And then there's also the point of like
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:53.260]   you aren't going to be able to find every single trend,
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.740]   but if you see something and you get yourself into it
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:58.100]   and investigate it, and granted,
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.500]   if you're gonna open up a tire store,
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:03.540]   that's gonna be a much higher startup cost,
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:06.140]   but starting a blog, starting a podcast,
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:09.220]   starting any of these mostly online endeavors
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:10.940]   won't require a tremendous amount of time.
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:13.700]   You won't have to sign a lease
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:16.740]   or commit to a huge liability.
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.820]   So I say you try 'em all,
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:22.420]   and then if one doesn't work, then you shutter it.
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:24.820]   There's always the tricky question of
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:25.940]   do you wanna quit too,
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.260]   how do you avoid quitting too early?
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.700]   How do you try to survive and things like that?
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.980]   But I remember when I went to college,
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.980]   it was 1998, dot-com boom.
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:38.980]   I'm like this is great, I'm gonna do computer science,
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:42.060]   I'm gonna graduate, work at a startup,
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:45.900]   and then March 2001, everything implodes,
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.860]   and I'm like well, I still got a year left of school,
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:51.420]   so what am I gonna do in the worst market
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:54.380]   for computer science graduates?
[00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:57.800]   And then I graduated, I found a job, everything was fine,
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:01.300]   and then I'm looking to buy a house,
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.420]   I catch it at the peak of the boom,
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:05.660]   I'm like man, my timing is incredible
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.940]   for all these major life decisions.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:11.380]   But it just goes to show those are huge markets
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.140]   that you're trying to predict,
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.620]   and not only are they huge from
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:17.020]   different factors perspective,
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.340]   there are a lot of different players
[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:20.460]   that are going to be spending a lot more time,
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:22.980]   have a lot more technology than you do.
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:26.080]   Try to play in a world that's a little bit smaller,
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.380]   that isn't as developed,
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:32.020]   and where the players in it aren't nearly as mature,
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.480]   and you're more likely to succeed.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.460]   - Play in the world that you know.
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:38.300]   - Exactly.
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.520]   - What are your current projects?
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.860]   - My current projects, so I mentioned
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.580]   that I was starting up another blog,
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.300]   I started about four or five months ago,
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.060]   it's called Wallet Hacks,
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:48.940]   and it's sort of taking that engineer's eye
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.060]   towards finances, how do you build systems
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:52.180]   so you can manage your money,
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.580]   and it's not taking up a tremendous amount of your time,
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:58.060]   how do you just be smarter with money,
[00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:59.660]   just with that engineer's eye.
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:04.060]   Have a meal plan business,
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:06.360]   so I like solving problems,
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.460]   and one of them was trying to figure out
[00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:10.140]   how do we build sort of a membership site,
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:14.740]   and help folks that, it started about two years ago,
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:16.500]   a year and a half ago,
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.940]   very much in the how do we help folks save money
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.580]   on one of their biggest expenses,
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.380]   which is food and meals,
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:24.240]   and so it's called $5 Meal Plan,
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:26.420]   and I work on that with a great partner,
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:29.300]   Erin, at $5 Dinners, it's all her recipes,
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:32.580]   tested, she has four kids, and it's great.
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:36.020]   Those are the two main projects I'm working on right now.
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:39.000]   - Why do you work on those,
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.380]   why do you work, why do you do that?
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:43.980]   - They're fun.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:46.780]   I don't know, it's just the whole problem solving again,
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:50.220]   like you asked before,
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:53.820]   can you create a blog today and build it to be a success?
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:57.400]   And I don't know if the answer is 100% yes,
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.060]   but I'm gonna try to do it again,
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:00.380]   I'm gonna do it a little differently
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:04.320]   since the environment has changed,
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.900]   and it's just fun to learn these things.
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:10.460]   And it's also, one of the big things that I missed
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:14.220]   about working sort of in an office was that social aspect,
[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:17.880]   and when, the meal plan business was fun
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:20.300]   from the perspective of how do we build a membership site,
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:24.060]   how do we build a community, and work with a partner,
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:28.060]   and that's been great, it's exceeded my expectations,
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:29.620]   but sort of writing about personal finance
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.340]   is a constant interest of mine,
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:35.020]   and then seeing if I can rebuild the blog has been fun.
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:37.420]   Like I miss getting emails for those years
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:38.980]   that I didn't have a site,
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:40.500]   I miss getting the emails from folks,
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.780]   like asking questions,
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.980]   and just learning about their experiences,
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:48.780]   and I guess I'm trying to relive old glory,
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:50.700]   and seeing if I can make it new glory again.
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:51.900]   (laughing)
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:53.300]   - It is kind of fun just to see,
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.700]   hey, I wonder if I could still do that,
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:56.100]   I think about that, I was like,
[00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:57.580]   I wonder if I could still sell insurance,
[00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:01.540]   I bet I could, but it's fun to be tested against the market.
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.100]   Are you enjoying it more this time around,
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.460]   now that it's more of the challenge,
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.940]   but the financial pressure is gone,
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.580]   what's the same, what's different,
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.340]   of this versus in the past?
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.260]   - So here's the funny,
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:16.580]   like it's fun because I don't have to fight through
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.660]   the frustrating elements,
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.420]   because like I said, when you started a blog before,
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:23.220]   you learned things, and now you don't have to relearn them.
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.420]   You know, it was fun not to have to do that again,
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.420]   and like have things break and not realize what's going on.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.420]   The other thing is that,
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.700]   and I never realized how much of an impact this had on me,
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:37.140]   but when people, I guess when they had low expectations
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.980]   of you, like whether because you're young or whatnot,
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:42.740]   like it's really fun to prove people wrong,
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.940]   and when you don't have that,
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.380]   there's a little bit of that motivation,
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:51.260]   it's not a big piece of my sort of internal motivation,
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.900]   but when people aren't like,
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.620]   wow, you really built an awesome thing,
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.820]   when you come at it years later,
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.500]   after you've had success,
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.340]   people are like, oh, well of course you're gonna do well.
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:03.580]   Like of course, what do you mean of course
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:04.420]   I'm gonna do well?
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:07.220]   Like you have all the friends and networks and connections,
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.620]   like yeah, but think about if you were to redo it,
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.180]   would you just go begging around everyone
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.180]   to like let you do this and that,
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.540]   without regard to what value you're providing them?
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.940]   No, of course not.
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.980]   Right, you'd essentially not start from zero,
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:23.180]   but you wouldn't be like asking all your friends for help.
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.940]   You wanna rebuild it on your own.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.980]   And so there's a little bit of that,
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.780]   you know, oh, of course it'll be easy.
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:30.860]   That can get a little annoying,
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:34.500]   but I mean, whatever, you still gotta do the work.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:37.460]   - Four final rapid fire questions.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.580]   Favorite finance related book?
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.700]   - Favorite finance related book?
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:50.340]   Oh, I don't have one.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:54.600]   I don't know if I've ever,
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.980]   yeah, I don't have a favorite finance book.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.820]   - Is there one that's impacted you more than most others?
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:07.420]   Doesn't have to be, just curious.
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:11.740]   - No, I just, there was a book that The Motley Fool put out
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:13.860]   years and years ago that I remember,
[01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.700]   it was probably the first one that I read,
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.580]   and I wish I could remember.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:21.140]   Yeah, I could send you the title maybe later.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:24.020]   - That kind of stuff, unless it was unique,
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.640]   it was one of those, here's the general guide
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.300]   in line and out line, framework type of thing.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.320]   That's easy to find.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.540]   All right, favorite personal finance related blog
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:35.040]   that's not wallethacks.com in today's world?
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.020]   - Ooh.
[01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:42.640]   So, man, now I feel like if I name one,
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.120]   this is what happens when you have a lot of friends.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.320]   They're all like, oh, well, thanks for not.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.540]   (laughing)
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.380]   - It's okay if it's someone that's not prominent.
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:53.380]   I'm just always interested in who,
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.520]   who are you paying attention to?
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.680]   Who are you enjoying reading?
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.880]   Not exclusive, who are you enjoying reading right now?
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.440]   - Who am I enjoying reading?
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.000]   So, there's, oh, you know what?
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.600]   One that I don't think a lot of people,
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.880]   there are two that come to mind.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.960]   One is, I think it's Dad Is Cheap.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.120]   The guy's name's Victor, Vic.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:17.520]   I think, I'm always just interested in his stories.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.420]   He only recently started his blog,
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:24.320]   and he lost his job and is spending more time at home,
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.640]   and it's just a very interesting,
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.120]   a lot of it mirrors the experiences I have.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.280]   I didn't lose my job, but I spent a lot of time at home
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.360]   with the kids, and they go to daycare,
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.320]   but some of the same issues.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.320]   The other one I like is Brokepedia.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.400]   It's Kristen.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.860]   She also writes for Lifehacker, their Two Cents blog.
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:49.360]   But, yeah, those are the two that I'm really getting into.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.200]   - That's cool. - That maybe aren't
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.020]   as well-known.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.440]   - Yeah, that's cool, 'cause I haven't heard of either one,
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.400]   so that's awesome.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.240]   All right, favorite, or a personal finance
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.720]   or finance-related podcast or other podcast that you enjoy?
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.780]   Obviously, you would say Radical Personal Finance,
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.780]   but other than Radical Personal Finance.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:07.740]   - There are a lot of really good podcasts.
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:10.640]   So, I mean, I really like Farnoosh,
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.480]   Tarabi's So Money. - So Money.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.880]   - But I feel like she doesn't need any more press.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.240]   She's already a rock star.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.120]   - She is, absolutely. - So.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.540]   I like Listen, Money Matters, Always a Reverend.
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:21.940]   That's always fun.
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.880]   And then Stacking Benjamins is fun.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.460]   Yeah, those are the ones for me.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:30.580]   - Cool, and is there a YouTube channel,
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.740]   someone that you see doing a great job on YouTube
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.840]   that you'd like to shine a little light on?
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.780]   - Ooh.
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:43.560]   Yes, but I don't know the name of the channel.
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.440]   I just know it's Thomas Frank.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.060]   - That's the guy's name? - He does study hacks.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.300]   Yeah, it's like study hacks type of things.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:51.660]   - Awesome. - But it's for students.
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.460]   And it's, they're like things on like
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.180]   how to take notes really quickly.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.580]   And I just like how well the videos are done.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.100]   I don't watch a lot of stuff on YouTube.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.900]   I mean, I suppose I do, but it's not cat videos.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:05.540]   But they're all like Conan O'Brien videos
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:06.900]   where they're like driving around a car
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.240]   or getting an Uber, things like that.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.820]   I don't know if those count.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:12.100]   But they're hilarious.
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:14.100]   - Well, awesome.
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.060]   Jim, I wanna thank you for coming on the show today.
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:16.140]   I've enjoyed it.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.700]   Congratulations on being one of the grandfathers
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:22.700]   of our budding personal finance industry.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.300]   If you were gonna give some closing words of advice
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.580]   to somebody who's interested in personal finance
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:29.620]   or listening to my show because they're interested
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.900]   in building their knowledge and their wealth,
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:35.140]   and you were gonna close with some final words of advice,
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.860]   what would you say?
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.740]   - I would say, if you ever have any questions,
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.900]   you can email me, jim@wallethacks.com.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:46.900]   But there is, just keep working hard at it.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.960]   If you wanna start a blog or any sort of business,
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.300]   perseverance is sort of underrated.
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:55.560]   And just keep after it.
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.700]   You'll learn a lot, even if things end up
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.200]   not as well as you'd hope.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.640]   But just keep after it.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:04.080]   - Thanks for coming on.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.000]   - Oh, it's a pleasure.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:05.840]   Thanks a lot.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:11.000]   - I chose to profile this interview very intentionally.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.500]   And I want you to pay attention to one major theme
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:14.420]   that came through the interview.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:16.400]   Jim gave a lot of great experience, a lot of great advice.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.800]   Pay attention to this theme.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.200]   Jim is financially independent.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:23.200]   But yet, what does he find himself doing?
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.100]   Working and building businesses.
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:32.020]   So, I am working to be financially independent
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:34.560]   based upon being able to live off of the income
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.560]   from my investment portfolio, but I'm not there yet.
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:38.400]   But you know what?
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.860]   I've built financial freedom through working
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.440]   and building businesses.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.120]   It's not quite the same financial freedom
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.480]   that Jim Wang enjoys at this point.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.200]   He's got more money than I do.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.560]   I'll get there, but you know what?
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.320]   I'm enjoying the process.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.680]   And I'm at a phase in my life where, at this point,
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.320]   I'm not willing to do a full-time job
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.560]   and work nights and weekends and everything on the show.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.460]   I'm at a different family stage than he was at that time.
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:04.600]   But I can still figure out my plan.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.880]   Jim figured out his plan, and you can figure out your plan.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.040]   Can't promise it's gonna work.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.800]   Nobody can, of course not.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.720]   But I can promise that if you try,
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.940]   you'll be closer to it working than if you don't try.
[01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:19.960]   So the best way to get started
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:23.000]   is to simply get started and adjust, correct.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.680]   If you wanna see adjustments and corrections,
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.080]   just listen to this show.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.800]   Go back and listen to the archives,
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.680]   and you'll see adjustments and corrections everywhere.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.360]   I'm always figuring it out, still working on it.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.440]   But still, that doesn't mean that the process
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:39.000]   isn't worth it and that you can't make it happen.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.880]   So learn from the example,
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.840]   work toward financial freedom in 10 years or less,
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.300]   but also live a rich life now.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.640]   Thank you so much for listening to today's show.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.720]   I hope it's been useful to you.

[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.640]   say thanks for coming on.
