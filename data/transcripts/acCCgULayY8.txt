[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - And when we hear that sperm counts are going down,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   are they going down to the point
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.780]   where fertility is impacted?
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.960]   That's really the one of the, I think, functional questions.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.480]   - And when you have 45 to 50 million per milliliter
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.040]   and below, it matters a lot what your sperm count is.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.640]   I mean, people say, "Does it matter?"
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.580]   Yeah, if you get in this range
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.080]   where the probability of conception
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.760]   is dropping off really rapidly, it matters a lot.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.720]   And then around 45 to 50, it starts to level off.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.280]   And then after that, after certainly after a hundred,
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.440]   probably 75, it doesn't matter at all.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.780]   So when people say,
[00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.560]   "Does sperm count matter for fertility?"
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.440]   Yes, it matters a lot if it's low.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.200]   And no, it doesn't matter at all if it's high.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.600]   So we just have too many sperm.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.400]   I mean, I don't, but humans, you know, and there's-
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.120]   - Nature runs a probability game, overproduce sperm.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.960]   - Right.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.200]   - And sperm counts range anywhere from, you know,
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.000]   it could be low eight, nine, 10 million per milliliter
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.480]   in the very low situation.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.320]   - It could be zero.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.560]   - It could be zero in some people, right?
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.120]   All the way up to 400 million.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.200]   There's a huge range.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.040]   - That's right.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.920]   - And that's a function of age.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.100]   It's a function of genetics.
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100]   It's a function of presumably phthalate exposure.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.640]   - I was asked to join a committee
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.660]   of the National Academy of Sciences.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.920]   And that committee was assembled to look at the question
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.000]   of whether hormonally active chemicals,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.200]   endocrine disrupting chemicals in the environment
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.940]   posed a threat to human health.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.880]   Because at that time it was like,
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.560]   well, yeah, we hear about this, but should we care, right?
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.560]   And so that committee wanted to consider a study
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.840]   that had come out of Denmark a few years earlier,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.840]   which claimed that sperm count had dropped 50% in 50 years.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   - Wow, that's a huge drop.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.440]   - That's what, we're seeing worse than that by the way now.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.160]   So, okay.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.240]   They said to me, I was the only statistician on the panel,
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.400]   would you look at this and see if we need to consider this
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.840]   in our deliberations?
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.520]   And as I mentioned, I'm skeptical and I looked at it
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.800]   and I thought, eh, I don't think so.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.280]   That was my initial reaction.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.480]   And that was because, first of all,
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.240]   I didn't know who had written this,
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.120]   I just saw it in a journal and it was not very big
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.000]   and not very many figures, not very much data.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.640]   And I thought of it and I thought,
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.440]   that's a big claim for a little paper.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.760]   But I'll look at it 'cause it's important.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.240]   And so, what I did then was to think about
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.240]   all the factors that we epidemiologists call confounders,
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.000]   things that might have caused that decline
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.600]   if it wasn't real biologically, right?
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.880]   And so, we could think of some of them together,
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.680]   maybe the method of counting sperm had changed
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.720]   so that later methods counted fewer sperm
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.000]   in the same sample.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   That's certainly possible, right?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.960]   But it turned out that wasn't the case
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.240]   'cause they actually had all used the same method.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.240]   And maybe the men had changed.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.800]   So, maybe you can't get a sperm count at random,
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.320]   you have to get somebody to volunteer, right?
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.240]   So, who were these men?
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.440]   Or were they very different in the early part of the study
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.520]   and the late part of the study in a way that maybe
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.800]   in the late part of the study,
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.040]   there were men with lower sperm count
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.480]   and they were more concerned?
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.760]   Maybe they were more obese.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.960]   That's pretty plausible.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.000]   Obesity is related to sperm count, fertility.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.400]   And maybe they smoked more and maybe,
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.000]   and so on and so forth, right?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So, what I did was to get the 61 studies,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.160]   go through them and try to extract information
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.280]   on all the factors that could explain the decline.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.120]   So, I created a multivariable model and ran that model.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.320]   And to my astonishment, when I was done,
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.760]   the slope of the decline was exactly the same
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.440]   to the first decimal place.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.520]   It had not explained anything.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.800]   I was like, oh my God, this looks like it might be real.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.080]   - This is really important to,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.560]   because I think what we're talking about here
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.240]   in parallel to the main conversation
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.400]   is how to do really great science.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.400]   - So, when I saw that and actually did another study
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.960]   to select my own studies and not accept her 61 studies
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.880]   that had been published,
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.200]   that Elizabeth Carlson had published.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.360]   So, new studies came up to more recent times,
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.800]   went back further, did it again,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.160]   found exactly the same thing.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.760]   Okay, so there were three looks at that.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.040]   And I thought, okay, I'm gonna accept this now.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.240]   This is, sperm count is declining.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.080]   And why?
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.560]   I turned to the why.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.120]   Okay, because up and down now,
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.440]   we hadn't said anything about why.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.400]   We just said, is it doing that?
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.240]   Yes.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.960]   Okay, now we believe it is declining.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.800]   Why?
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.920]   And so then I thought quite a lot and talked to people
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.760]   and ruled out genetics because it was too fast.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.320]   It's two generations, it's too fast.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.840]   50 years, two generations.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.800]   So, if it's not genetics, then it's environment.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.200]   And so what is it about the environment that could do this?
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.040]   So, I asked, okay, in the environment,
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.680]   there could be things that are making sperm decline.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.480]   So, if you think about how you might look at that,
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.520]   you might design the study that I designed next,
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.440]   which was another study.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.680]   And by the way, this preceded the AGD.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.080]   So, we had four cities in the United States
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.200]   that we picked with different environments.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.560]   And then we got men to come in
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.880]   and we used the same equipment at each place.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.800]   We used the same method of selecting the men.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.920]   The technicians were trained centrally at UC Davis.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.520]   We had very good quality control.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.160]   So, samples were sent around every quarter
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.200]   to make sure that everybody was measuring things
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.880]   the same way.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.080]   We didn't want drift, right?
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.160]   And then we got their urine.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.040]   And that's how I had those urine samples.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.400]   So, if you wanted to do this study
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.040]   and you wanted to get a representative sample of men,
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.960]   where would you go?
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.520]   Because you can't, I can't ask a guy in the street
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.200]   to give me a semen sample, right?
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.080]   I mean, it's not something you'd get very, you know.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.000]   So, I thought, how can I get a representative sample,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.360]   and which would teach me something
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.280]   about a larger population called the parent population.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.440]   So, here's a sample, it should represent the parent.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.320]   So, how do I ensure that?
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.320]   And what I decided was to sample partners of pregnant women.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.680]   Because pregnant women all come to medical care, almost all.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.800]   And if their partners will give a semen sample,
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.160]   then we have a representative sample.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.520]   And we know what we're looking at.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.720]   So, that's what we did.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.360]   So, this is a, the semen study
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.880]   is the study of partners of pregnant women.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.200]   And of course, they'll have slightly higher semen quality
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.120]   'cause they got their partner pregnant, but.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.760]   And so, we had their urine, we had their blood,
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   and we looked at their semen quality.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.560]   And then we decided to look at pesticides.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.480]   And the reason we look at pesticides
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.280]   was because there was a lot of gradation
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.000]   across our four centers in pesticide use.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.960]   And what we found was really extraordinary
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.480]   that men who were living in central Missouri,
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.760]   where I was living at the time,
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.200]   who were in the middle of a agricultural belt
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.040]   where there was spraying all the time
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.080]   for soybeans and so on.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.840]   Those men had half as many moving sperm
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.640]   as men in Minneapolis.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.760]   - Whoa.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.600]   - Whoa.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.440]   Huge, right?
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.240]   And then we went one step further.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.520]   And within Missouri, we looked at a sample of men
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.080]   who had very high sperm parameters
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.840]   and very low sperm parameters
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.000]   and showed that five pesticides were significantly higher
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.560]   in the men with the low sperm parameters.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.560]   That include motility, morphology, you know.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.600]   - So, these are pesticides
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.480]   that are being sprayed in the air on crops.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.560]   You mentioned soybeans, what other types of crops?
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.880]   - I don't know.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.720]   I don't remember.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.520]   - So, plant and fruit crops, presumably.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.720]   - Yeah, whatever they were growing
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.640]   in Columbia, Missouri at that time.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.320]   - And just to make sure I understand,
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.480]   it's not that the men need- - Soybeans, corn and soybeans.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.320]   - Corn and soybeans.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.560]   But we're not talking about eating corn and soybeans.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.200]   We're talking about living in an area
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.520]   where pesticides are being used by,
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.360]   what is it called?
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.560]   Is it still called dust crop?
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.160]   - Yeah, we didn't go into how they got these.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.680]   We just looked in their urine
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.880]   and there were the metabolites.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.880]   The metabolites don't get in their urine
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.280]   unless they were exposed.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.520]   - Exposed through the air
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.320]   or exposed by eating corn and soybeans?
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.160]   We don't know.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.000]   - We don't know.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.080]   - Okay. - We don't know.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.560]   But this was not a particularly,
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.840]   you know, we didn't sample farmers only
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.680]   or anything like that.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.080]   So, whoever came into the,
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.640]   you remember how we got these men?
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.960]   Their wives were pregnant.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.560]   They were having prenatal care
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.440]   at the University of Missouri.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.600]   So, that's where we got them.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.440]   Whoever happened to come in to the prenatal clinic
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.240]   and agreed to be in our study,
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.600]   their, the male, you know, urine,
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.520]   male's urine was measured for these pesticides.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.000]   - I'm sure a number of people,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.920]   including myself, are wondering
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:17.160]   in what other products are these five pesticides present?
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.360]   Are these commonly used pesticides
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.440]   or is it something about-
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.240]   - They're called the triazine pesticides.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.360]   Atrazine is, was the most widely used
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.560]   and it's a huge use around the world.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.560]   I mean, it's highly, you know,
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.960]   one of the most, the largest commercial pesticides.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.080]   So, these were very big players in the pesticide field.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.940]   you
