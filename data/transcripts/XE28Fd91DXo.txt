[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   So, what are some other methods that we can use to alleviate acute soreness?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.160]   Well, if we continue down this same theme, which is saying, okay, we use some sort of
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.240]   pressure manipulation to enhance recovery.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.680]   If compression is one strategy, you can also use things like compression boots or garments.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.480]   And these are pneumatic devices that will, you know, pump air outside you and compress
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.480]   back and forth.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.720]   There's any number of devices that will do this.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.080]   You can also use the physical hand.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.600]   So this would be massage and body work.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.360]   They're all really working as best we can tell on the same mechanisms, which are effectively
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.440]   moving fluid in and out of the tissue, as well as potentially enhancing blood flow,
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.480]   increasing capillarization, and which is going to only get nutrients in and waste products
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.480]   out.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.440]   So, you can kind of pick and choose based upon your budget, preferences, availability
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.040]   timing, things like that.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.240]   So, those are all effective strategies.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.680]   Outside of that really is the next largest category, which is now thermal.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.280]   And so far in this discussion, we've mentioned cold water immersion.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.700]   And I talked about in the hypertrophy section how you would not want to do that immediately
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.400]   post-exercise, which would be getting into cold water or an ice bath, if you're trying
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.200]   to grow muscle mass.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.400]   Having said that, there is good evidence showing that cold water immersion specifically is
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.120]   effective at reducing muscle soreness.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.400]   So it is a fair consideration, and it's a classic example of how there are no free passes
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.400]   in physiology.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.200]   Nothing is always good or always bad.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.780]   It's always about what are you willing to give up versus what you're willing to get.
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.720]   And in the case of like cold water immersion, you may be thinking, "Yeah, I might want
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.800]   some of the hypertrophic adaptations."
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.600]   But if you're in that phase of training where you're actually trying to push more towards
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.000]   optimization in that moment rather than long-term adaptation, then an ice bath might be a great
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   choice.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.600]   In addition, if you fall into a scenario like Natasha did, and you realize like, "I'm just
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.140]   so unbelievably sore, this might cost me three or four or five or six days of training,"
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.400]   it might be worth it for you to accelerate that recovery process by a couple of days
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.040]   so that you don't miss so much training.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.480]   So it's an algorithm, it's an equation.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   What am I looking for?
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.440]   Again, if I'm in season or trying to compete, or if I have just done way, way, way too much
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.040]   exercise and I'm really in significant pain, you would probably be willing to give up some
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.560]   small percentage of eventual muscle growth after a single session to get out of pain.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.360]   So of the cold strategies, cold water immersion is clearly the best approach rather than cold
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.360]   air or some other tactics.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.800]   So a cold shower is probably not enough here.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.120]   You really do want to be either in moderately cold.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.880]   This is maybe 40 to 50-degree water for probably north of 15 minutes, or you can be in sub-40
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.320]   for as little as maybe five minutes to get some of the effect.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.960]   And there's been a number of studies, so I'm sort of summarizing a bunch of that kind of
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.240]   into one rather than going through them point by point.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.960]   The numbers you just threw out, which I'm assuming are Fahrenheit, seem really cold
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.640]   to me, right?
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   Uncomfortably cold.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   Absolutely.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.240]   I always recommend that people ease into it as a protocol overall, that they not immediately
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.040]   go to 35-degree cold water if they've never done it before.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.120]   That said, once people are comfortable being uncomfortable, because I always answer the
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.480]   question how cold should it be exactly, would you agree that it should be very, very cold,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.960]   so much so that you really, really want to get out, but that you're able to stay in safely,
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.400]   whatever that value happens to be?
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.960]   You absolutely need to be safe.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.280]   Having said that, we have actually, in our XPT retreats, put dozens if not hundreds of
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.800]   people at this point immediately into the sub-35-degree water their first time ever
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.640]   and done three minutes, multiple rounds in a session, so they can handle it.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.680]   You don't need to go that crazy if you don't want.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.680]   You kind of have to play a game, right?
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.400]   Do you want to be really, really cold for a short amount of time, or do you want to
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.880]   be kind of cold for a longer amount of time?
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.520]   Maybe the only mistake you could make is doing something like 65-degree water, which to most
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.480]   people is not very comfortable, and doing five or ten minutes.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.680]   It's just not going to be effective.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.120]   It's probably not going to be effective.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.960]   If you're like, "Man, 35 is absolutely crazy," and you want to do 55-degree water, and there's
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.960]   literature in that area, but it's going to say you need to probably be there somewhere
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.560]   almost surely north of ten minutes, and some of it will actually show you need to be in
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.720]   there well north of 20 to 30 minutes.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.280]   For my money, I would rather go really, really cold and get it done in five minutes, but
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.840]   personal preference on this one.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.060]   You can also make it a little bit easier on yourself.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.000]   There is not nearly as much evidence, but there is some on contrast stuff.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.200]   This is when you go cold, hot, and sort of back and forth.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.480]   There are no really good rules in terms of how much should you go, how many rounds, how
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.280]   long in cold, how long in hot.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.360]   Again, there have been a couple of studies, and obviously those studies use numbers, but
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.120]   that doesn't mean those have been tested to see what are optimal, which is a very big
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.860]   difference.
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.000]   You can really just kind of play that by feel.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.200]   Hot is good for recovery.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.400]   You just have to be careful because you are going to put more blood flow in the area,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.360]   and so you may walk out of there with some additional acute swelling, which is then going
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.680]   to put greater pressure on there.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.680]   You have to kind of play with that.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.840]   I personally really like hot for recovery.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.720]   I will feel maybe not great in that moment, but the next day I tend to feel really, really
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   good.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.120]   In addition, if I wake up the next morning and I'm really, really hurting and I'm super
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.480]   stiff, a hot bath will help that quite a bit.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.360]   So you can play with some of those protocols, and you don't have to do ice.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.840]   There's absolutely no requirement to do so.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.200]   It is just an option if you're interested.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:04.080]   DAN: The studies of Dr. Susanna Soberg are not directly aimed at alleviating soreness
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.080]   or recovery.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.160]   They're more about increasing thermal capacity by storage of brown adipose tissue, not the
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.060]   blubbery fat, but the stuff around the clavicles and around the heart that help you generate
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.880]   body heat at rest and metabolism and so on.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.840]   The numbers there that she's come up with, again, have not been tested against all the
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.200]   possible derivations.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.520]   Just like with breathing, we did five-minute sessions, but who knows, maybe a minute would
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.760]   have been equally effective.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.760]   There are constraints on these sorts of studies.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.040]   But the values that she's come up with, which seem to be good thresholds for making sure
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.120]   that an adaptation response is triggered by heat and cold, is it ends up being 57 minutes
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.720]   per week total of uncomfortable but safe heat, in that case sauna, and that can be all in
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.600]   one session or breaking it up into a couple of sessions on the same day or different days,
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.200]   and then 11 minutes per week of cold, either in one single session or multiple sessions.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.080]   Again, one could do more.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.680]   One could break that up over multiple days or do it all in one day or do it all in one
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.400]   hour in the sauna and then 11 minutes in the cold or vice versa, although that seems a
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.440]   little bit extreme, especially for the uninitiated.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.480]   But those are the numbers that have been studied.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.300]   But as you point out, there are not a lot of really thorough studies examining different
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.480]   cold protocols according to temperature by time requirements.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.800]   So there is a bit of subjective feel required to establish a routine.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.840]   And I would actually say this is another time to reemphasize something we talked about at
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.880]   the beginning of our conversation, which is that pain itself is not a defined outcome.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.720]   It's heavily influenced by your perception.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.620]   And so if you don't feel like they work for you, they won't work.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.000]   If you feel like they work fantastic, they do.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.160]   So it's a challenging field to get really objective data on.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.040]   So there's always going to be a little bit of subjective nature to some of these things.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.400]   I can tell you anecdotally, we've used hot and cold contrasts for a long time with athletes.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.520]   Some love it, some don't care for it, and everything in between.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.280]   So it's one of those things where I never mandated.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.280]   Of course, I can't mandate anything for anyone I work with.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.280]   But I'm never like, "Hey, are you interested?
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.280]   Great.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.280]   You're struggling in this area.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.280]   Do you want to try this?
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.280]   You did and you liked it.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.280]   Great.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.280]   You're struggling in this area and you tried it.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.280]   You didn't love it.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.280]   Okay, fine.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.280]   I'm not.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.440]   We'll find other routes as we'll get into.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.880]   There's a lot of ways to enhance recovery.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:31.000]   This is only one, and it hasn't even really come down to stopping the problem in the first
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   place.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.400]   We're just treating symptoms, which is first line of defense, but you really need to go
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.100]   back and figure out why it's happening to begin with as a solution.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.120]   These are just different, again, acute symptom management tactics.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:51.680]   [music]
