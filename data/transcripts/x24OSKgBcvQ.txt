[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   Would it be fair to say anyone who has assets, children, or preferences on what happens to them
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.760]   should probably have a will or...?
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.320]   Every adult does need a will. You should have a will on your 18th birthday. Are you going to?
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.680]   Is that what you're going to be first thing in line, Monday morning, your 18th birthday? No,
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.840]   let's be realistic. But every adult should have a will. There's no minimum asset thresholds.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.920]   And like you said, even if you don't have this huge amount of assets, you don't have children,
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.640]   you still have final arrangements, and you still have some property that you will dispose of,
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.600]   whether it's high value or sentimental property, you need a will. Every adult needs a will.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.880]   I wanted to talk to someone who I think really understands
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.440]   all of the advanced tactics people are using to both avoid taxes now,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.440]   avoid taxes in the future, be able to transfer money to their children.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:55.520]   The estate tax is, it makes all other taxes look low. So just the federal tax rate alone is 40%.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.120]   It does graduate, but it gets to 40% pretty quickly. And that's just federal. So then you
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.000]   can start to layer on state taxes on top of that, and it can get much, much higher. Now,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.160]   some of these state estate taxes actually start at levels below this 12 million,
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.440]   depends on a state by state basis. But the federal is the most punitive. And that's primarily what
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.680]   people are concerned about is if they're trying to pass on as much of their hard-earned wealth to
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.920]   their kids or grandchildren, how do they work around the estate tax? And this is where estate
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.280]   planning comes into play. Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.560]   upgrading your life, money, and travel. I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have my
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.160]   first two interview episode today. We'll first talk about estate planning with Patrick Hicks,
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.280]   a lawyer who recently became the general counsel for Trust & Will. Now, if you're not familiar with
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.680]   estate planning, think of it a little bit like risk management for your family. It's a way to
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.120]   protect and guide your loved ones should you die or become incapacitated. Now, I know that's not
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.400]   the most exciting topic for a dinner conversation, but I promise it's an important one and we'll get
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.360]   into some really tactical advice. After that, we'll talk to Mani Mahadevan, who runs a company
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.960]   called Valor, which is really democratizing access to the kinds of trusts that wealthy people use to
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.240]   limit the taxes they pay. It was so fascinating to hear about some of the crazy ways that people
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.600]   avoid giving the IRS more money. I know this is a longer episode, but both of these conversations
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.160]   were on similar topics and were so interesting that I thought it would be worth combining them
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:37.520]   into one. So let's jump right in. Patrick, thank you for being here.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.280]   Happy to be here and speak with you.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.560]   You know, I just spent some time talking about some of the aspects of how people and their
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.160]   families can start to protect themselves, their documents, and I didn't spend as much time on
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.480]   the legal side of things. So I think most people have heard of the term will and I've written about
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.520]   it a bit and we've mentioned it in the past. Maybe we could just start at the basics about
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.280]   what kind of is a will and who needs one? Yeah, that's a great question. So a will is a
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.080]   fundamental estate planning document. And once you have all of your decisions made and your
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.920]   intentions and your preferences, it's these legal documents are the ones that actually make them
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.480]   legally binding, enforceable, and valid. So that's the difference between I have a desire
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.280]   and now I actually have an enforceable legal decision. That's the estate planning documents.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.800]   And the will is the cornerstone, fundamental estate planning document. It's incredibly old.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.480]   It's been around the concept of a will since ancient Greece, but the will as we know it today,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.600]   even that the origins kind of trace back to the 16th century. Henry VIII was the king when they
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.000]   passed the Statute of Wills Act that set a lot of the requirements that we're still working with
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.800]   today. So that's how long a will has been part of estate planning in modern society, if you can
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.040]   really call the 16th century modern society. We're still using the same rules. So I guess I got to
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.480]   give them a little bit of credit. Wow. I didn't know the history. Are there
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.800]   a handful of things if you went through a list of like what are the main components of it,
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.320]   the decisions that you want to think about before creating one?
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.480]   Yeah, absolutely. So a will, because it is a very fundamental document, it handles fundamental
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.200]   needs. And there's three primary needs that every will will handle. And the first is it will
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.400]   dispose of your assets. It will say where your things go, who gets what after your death. And
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.360]   a will only applies at death, but that's what it does is it transfers your assets after death.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.720]   The second thing after disposing of your assets is it will choose who will care for your children.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.320]   Now your children are not assets. You don't dispose of them in quite the same way,
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.240]   but a will allows you to nominate someone who can care for your children to serve as their
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.200]   guardian. And the last thing that a will does is allows you to specify your own final arrangements,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.600]   your burial preferences. Do you want to be cremated, buried at sea, blasted to the moon,
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.680]   whatever it is that you want to do, a will lets you select those three things.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.680]   Dispose of your assets, someone to care for your children and your final arrangements.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.680]   Those are the core functions of a will.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.000]   Would it be fair to say anyone who has assets, children, or preferences on what happens to them
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.960]   should probably have a will? Or what would happen if I wrote a document, it wasn't fancy,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.960]   and I emailed it to like three friends that just kind of said, "Here's what I want to do."
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.880]   Does that work in place of a will? Or what's kind of necessary for this to all play out
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.600]   how you want it?
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.160]   Yeah, those are great questions. So the first one is every adult does need a will. You should have
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.440]   a will on your 18th birthday. Are you going to? Is that what you're going to be first thing in
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.280]   line Monday morning on your 18th birthday? No, let's be realistic. But every adult should have
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.240]   a will. There's no minimum asset thresholds. And like you said, even if you don't have this huge
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.640]   amount of assets, you don't have children, you still have final arrangements and you still have
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.960]   some property that you will dispose of, whether it's high value or sentimental property,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.760]   you need a will. Every adult needs a will.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.240]   But if you don't have a will or if you're looking to kind of create your intentions without a will,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.640]   it starts to get a little dicey because you can send that email or even draft a letter to your
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.720]   friends and say, "In the event of my death, I want this to happen." And the question is,
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:10.560]   is that legally valid and enforceable? Is that enough for your preferences to be given actual
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.440]   weight in the eyes of the law? And in many times, unfortunately, the answer is no. And so when you
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.480]   have that result, you may think you have a plan, but the law disregards your plan and you wind up
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.320]   dying with no estate plan at all.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.920]   And so let's take an example. Somebody has $50,000, one child, and a strong desire to be
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.960]   cremated, but no will, no email sent to anyone. Maybe they've told their spouse what they want,
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.600]   or maybe we can go through whether they do or don't have a spouse. But what would happen? What
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.800]   would happen to that $50,000 without a will? What would happen to their child and who makes
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.880]   the decision on what happens to their remains?
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.880]   Yeah. So if you die without a will, that's known as dying intestate or
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.520]   intestacy is the process that you go through. And that simply means that you have no will
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.040]   at death. And every state has a set of laws that will apply that says, if there is no will,
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.080]   here are the default laws. And those default laws attempt to kind of fill in all those holes.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.800]   So it will say who's responsible for making decisions or where assets might go or who
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.680]   might have priority to care for children. So it's an attempt to fill in those gaps,
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:27.040]   but it's not a perfect solution by any stretch. In your situation, that $50,000 would most likely
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.520]   be split between the surviving spouse and their surviving child. So $25,000 to each of them.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.160]   And that's just that default law. Now, that spouse might be the person who has the
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.640]   presumed authority to make decisions who could say, "Hey, I happen to know that this person
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.120]   wanted to be cremated. So we're going to choose cremation." But if they don't know that,
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.720]   or if they disagree with that, if you've never expressed that preference at all,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.960]   that spouse may have the legal right to act, but they don't have the knowledge of what your
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.760]   preferences are. So you have to have both sides. You have to have clear intentions and you have to
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.000]   have legal authority. And without a will, you're really running a risk that you don't have either
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.680]   of those. And if you didn't have a spouse, what happens to children or assets? Or if you don't
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.040]   have children, what happens to assets? Yeah. So if you don't have a spouse,
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.040]   you don't have children. Most of these state laws, what they have is a set of, essentially,
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.880]   an if-then statement. So if you have a spouse, everything goes to your spouse. And if you have
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.640]   a spouse and one child, it's divided equally. If you have a spouse and two children,
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   it's just kind of corresponding, cascading set of decisions. But if you really boil it down,
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.840]   all of these laws basically say assets pass to your closest living relatives.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.880]   So if you have a spouse, maybe your spouse or your kids, and if you don't have one,
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.920]   it might be your parents or your siblings. Maybe you can go out to your grandparents
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.360]   and your cousins. So if you're really isolated and don't have close family,
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.640]   it might still pass to your cousins. The problem is getting that process completed,
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.280]   getting to that finish line could be a difficult step. And it's just sometimes,
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.160]   by the time the assets get to that cousin, the assets might even be depleted by fees and expenses.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.440]   And so you're really starting to eat into the beneficiary's actual receipt of funds from your
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:14.080]   estate. And I assume if you had neighbors who were kind of unofficial godparents to your children,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.280]   and your desire was, "I wish they could take our kids," and you didn't have a will to state that,
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.400]   I imagine that would probably be a difficult thing because neighbors and friends probably
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.920]   aren't in the kind of statutes of if-then statements. Right, absolutely. And so if you
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.560]   have assets you want to leave to your neighbors or your close friends, the law just doesn't look
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.880]   at that at all. It's either a family member or you're not. So if you have something like that,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.760]   you really critically need an estate plan in place. But with children, it's even trickier
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.280]   because ultimately the court is compelled to do what is best for the child. So even if as a parent,
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.840]   I say, "I want my neighbor to care for my child," and the court will look at that and it's very
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.200]   unlikely. But if the court says, "Hey, this is a really bad decision for some unknown scenario,
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.400]   maybe the neighbors have developed a drug habit or something like that that is unknown to me,"
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.160]   the court can actually step in and say, "We're going to overrule this decision and we're going
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.400]   to pass the children to someone else." And it kind of leaves the court with almost too many options.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.720]   Should we give it to a family member? Should we give it to close friends or does the child fall
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:25.280]   into the system, the foster care for the state? It's almost too open-ended and it leaves your
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.280]   children with no certainty. And what's already, if you think about a tragic time, the loss of
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.320]   a parent, it's a lot for a child to be expected to bear. Wow. So it's pretty clear that
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.080]   everyone probably needs a will. What would actually happen, I'm just curious, if you
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.880]   were in debt? Let's say someone actually had the opposite of ads, they just had liabilities.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:52.320]   Is that a rare circumstance where if you had no kids, no spouse, no desires for your remains,
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.880]   it might be better to not specify who takes on those liabilities? Or what happens when
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.720]   you die with credit card debt or a mortgage that you don't have enough assets to cover?
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.120]   Yeah, that's a great question. So there's two types of debt. The first type is known as recourse
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.360]   debt. And that's something that might be like your mortgage on your house. It's actually tied
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.920]   to a specific property. And so that debt is associated with that property. If you want to
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.480]   leave someone that property, they take it with that debt. The other type is something like maybe
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.040]   your credit card bills. And that's just as a personal promise to repay that debt. The benefit
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.960]   of that second type, your credit cards, any sort of normal outstanding loans, they don't evaporate
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:34.240]   that death. They can be paid off from any assets in your estate. But if there are not enough assets
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.280]   to pay down those debts, those debts just go away. They don't get passed on to your heirs.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.200]   As a general rule, there's some weird exceptions that might pop up here and there. So it's not
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.400]   always a black and white scenario. But generally, you don't have to pass on liabilities to your
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.680]   children. But you still need to account for that plan. Because if you don't have that accounted
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.320]   for as part of your estate plan, you can actually have a creditor who will come in and say, well,
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.840]   we're going to open up the probate proceeding, for example. And we're going to call the shots.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.960]   And we're going to run the show. So it may still not be in your best interest.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.480]   Even if you don't have significant assets, everyone has something of sentimental value,
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:14.960]   whether it's a photo album or old furniture in your house is an antique. And it's something
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:20.480]   been in the family a long time that a creditor is going to say, well, that's $50 at a consignment
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.240]   shop. And they're going to look at it as dollar amounts. And it's going to deplete what could be
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.040]   sentimental inheritance to your children, for example.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.880]   So I think that makes a lot of sense. Will, seems to be something that everyone listening should
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:39.920]   have, at least over 18. What about all of these other documents? So I've written in the past about
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   the full estate plan. And I know in California, that's sometimes something that has to do with
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.560]   avoiding probate. I don't generally know across the country what all the rules are.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.880]   But what would you say is the kind of core difference between an estate plan and a will?
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.880]   And who needs to make the upgrade? Yeah, so I think the best way to think
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:07.040]   about it is an estate plan is a set of documents. And then a state plan can contain a variety of
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.240]   documents depending on your particular situation. Most typically, an estate plan will have at least
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.720]   a will and a set of healthcare documents, maybe a power of attorney or a living will
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.120]   or advanced healthcare directive, something like that. So that set is really the fundamental
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.160]   building block of an estate plan. You can also add additional documents. So a trust,
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.880]   a living trust, for example, is a very common additional document to be included in an estate
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.040]   plan. And if you start getting in more complex situations, you might have other types of trust,
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.280]   maybe your asset protection trusts or really charitable giving trust, anything like that,
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.160]   that are really specific tools for specific use cases. Not everyone's going to have those as
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.120]   part of their estate plan. But if you have that need, it is a great fit for your situation.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.880]   But that core set, will and healthcare documents. So fortunately, we're going to have Monte from
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.920]   Valor on the show in a little bit. So we don't have to get into a lot of those complex things.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.600]   But I do think it would be good to walk through the basic documents. I know,
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.320]   even I originally got confused when I was like, "Okay, so there's a will and then there's a
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.640]   living will. And it turns out the living will is not the same thing as what you think of as a will.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.000]   So maybe we could just kind of step through the common components of an
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.040]   estate plan and maybe start from the most common. So you said these kind of healthcare documents
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:27.440]   and move towards and maybe end at the living trust and talk about what they are and who might need
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.000]   them. Yeah. So you have the will. The will, the fundamental document, dispose of your assets at
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.600]   death, nominate guardians for children, final arrangements. A will only applies at death.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.040]   It has no impact on you during your lifetime. Where you fill that out or kind of compliment
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.880]   a will is with something known as healthcare documents. And this might be this group of
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.120]   documents is sometimes known as healthcare documents or disability documents, incapacity
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:56.480]   documents, a variety of names that might apply here. And within that group of documents, you
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.040]   typically see something called a power of attorney. And then you see a healthcare directive or a
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.480]   living will medical directive. Again, there's a lot of interchangeable terms here, but the basic
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.880]   concept is these healthcare documents. These apply during your lifetime. So a will applies
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.440]   after death, but healthcare documents apply during your lifetime and allow you to make decisions for
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.480]   what should happen if you are alive, but unable to speak for yourself. So maybe you've had, you
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.320]   know, a medical emergency, you're incapacitated, you stepped off the curb and got hit by that
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.280]   proverbial bus, whatever it is that you're unable to make a decision for yourself at that time.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.480]   These documents can step in and kind of fill in that gap and either speak for you or nominate
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:40.080]   someone else to make decisions on your behalf. Okay. And what kinds of decisions can you make
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.640]   in advance? What do you need to specify? Kind of what goes into the nuance of creating them?
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.280]   So each document does a little bit, each document does one thing a little bit different than each
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.680]   other document. So that's why they're typically kind of coupled together as a set. The power of
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.000]   attorney handles your financial affairs and essentially it's everything that's not medical.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.320]   So it ranges from banking and taxes to real estate, anything that you need to do as a
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.320]   transactional matter other than dealing with healthcare, that's where the power of attorney
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:11.360]   will fill in. And this essentially allows you to designate someone else to sit in your place,
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:17.200]   step into your shoes and make decisions on your behalf. That's great to cover a wide range of
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:23.280]   really common needs. The healthcare side, you have a set of documents known as either a living will,
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.880]   an advanced directive, a medical directive. Again, a lot of different terms can be used
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:32.720]   interchangeably. And these do two things. One, they specify your medical preferences. So what
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.360]   type of care do you want to receive or not want to receive? You can make choices for yourself.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.840]   But the second thing they do is they nominate someone else again to fill in those gaps.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:47.280]   So if a decision has to be made and you have it spoken in advance, who answers those questions
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.480]   for you? And that's the medical side that pairs with the financial side. Both of those two
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.400]   documents together comprise the healthcare documents as a single unit. And I know for
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.560]   having filled out these documents, one of the big decisions you often talk about is
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.800]   kind of plans for life support. So for anyone listening, and you're kind of thinking,
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.200]   "What kind of decisions would I want to make?" It's if you were in a coma, how do you want to
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:17.760]   treat that? What kinds of... The options are often like, "Go at all expense to try and prolong my
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:23.280]   life." Or if a doctor determines that we've done kind of as much as is reasonable, "Don't keep
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.280]   going." So those are the kinds of decisions that you might have a different opinion on than
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:33.200]   whoever's in charge. And you can specify in advance. Yeah, these are inherently personal
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.440]   decisions. And so your choice is specific to you. No one else can make the same choice that
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.560]   you would in that circumstance. They're also very difficult decisions. And so it's unfortunate for
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.920]   anyone to be asked to make a decision with no guidance. That can be just incredibly overwhelming
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.800]   for that individual to think, "What am I supposed to do? Am I going to hold a plug or leave them on
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.600]   life support?" I mean, they can carry that doubt and potentially guilt for the rest of their
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.000]   lifetime worrying if they made the wrong choice. So it's not always something you do for yourself.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.480]   It's really important for you to do this to think about those who are also still alive and making
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.360]   decisions for you and what the benefit you can provide to them. And who would make that decision
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.320]   absent these documents? If I hadn't nominated someone to be my healthcare... I'm guessing
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.800]   the law stipulates, "Okay, if you have a spouse, the spouse makes a decision." Is it the same thing?
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.160]   The closest living relative is kind of the person who gets to make the call?
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.480]   It does. And it follows the same set of rules. They're different rules, but they're the same
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.240]   structure, at least. So it'd be your spouse, your kids, your parents, closest living relatives. But
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.840]   you can get into a situation if you have three kids and they're equally entitled to make a
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:41.280]   decision and they disagree, what happens then? So it can be very important because you have to make
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.960]   one single decision. And in many cases, you don't have time to work out a dispute or go to court,
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.280]   get a court to intervene and make a decision on behalf of the three kids. Some of these decisions
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.400]   are very urgent. So having a plan is really particularly important for healthcare decisions.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.800]   We've got a will, we've got your medical and your power of attorney documents to cover your
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.400]   finances. What are other things people should be considering when it comes to their estate planning?
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.000]   So the other core document that many people should look at is a trust.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.400]   And when I say trust, I mean a revocable living trust. There's a whole wide range of trusts,
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.720]   but we're talking about a revocable living trust. The revocable part simply means that it's able to
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.120]   be amended or changed or even revoked during your lifetime. And the living part just simply means
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:30.640]   you create it while you're alive. So it sounds kind of complicated, but it's the workhorse of
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.920]   modern estate planning. That is the document that the majority of individuals who look to add
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:40.080]   something beyond a will will look to add a revocable living trust into their plan.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:46.160]   Like the will, it allows you to make decisions after death, but it also applies during your
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.120]   lifetime. So a trust kind of blurs the line. It allows you to handle some of those lifetime
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.080]   incapacity issues, but also allows you to plan for what happens after death, where your assets should
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.480]   go, who should be in charge, things like that. I'll just flag for anyone listening. A lot of
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.600]   times, we've all seen some TV show or movie where some kid gets a trust fund and there's
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.720]   tens of millions of dollars. And I think my original knowledge of it was like, "Trusts are
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:17.040]   just for millionaires who have so much money that they want to limit how much goes to their kids."
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.720]   I've learned over time that that is true. There are lots of trusts. They're actually usually more
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:29.120]   the irrevocable kind that have a lot of different tax and tax avoidance often benefits. And we're
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.800]   going to talk about those a little bit later because I think it's really fun to understand.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.560]   But the revocable or irrevocable trust is really not a thing just for people with millions of
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.640]   dollars. But who should be thinking about this? When does it make sense to say, "Okay,
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.760]   a will and some of these healthcare documents is not enough. Let's look at the trust."
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.640]   Yeah. So there are a few reasons you might want to look to add a trust to your estate plan.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.360]   And the first, if you focus on what a trust does, a trust gives you more control over the
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.480]   distribution of your assets. When and how those assets are distributed to your beneficiaries.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.240]   So this might be useful if you have young children, you might want to look to add a trust
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.960]   because that allows you to say, "Hey, I want my assets to go to my kids, but maybe not at age 18.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:18.880]   I want them to go at age 25 or split half at 25 and half at 35." You have a little more control
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.280]   over when and how assets are distributed. Similarly, if you're in a blended family or
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.120]   if you're a second marriage situation, a trust allows you to do a little more in terms of,
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.200]   "I want to support my spouse, but I want to ensure that ultimately those assets
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.360]   pass to my children. I don't want to worry about leaving everything to my spouse. And then my
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.600]   spouse either getting remarried or leaving everything to my stepchildren with my kids
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.560]   receiving nothing." So those kinds of complex family dynamic situations, it's a great option
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:51.360]   for a trust. Beyond that though, a trust has one feature that a will does not. A will goes
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.920]   through probate after death and it becomes essentially a public document. And a trust
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.400]   stays private. So if you want to have a little privacy in your affairs, particularly after your
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:06.000]   death, a trust gives you that and a will simply does not. But the primary reason for most people
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.160]   to look for a trust is to avoid probate entirely. And that's something that a will, by nature of a
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.120]   will, it goes through probate and a trust just simply bypasses the probate process entirely.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.280]   That can be a massive savings of not just time and effort, but money for a whole lot of people.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.920]   So I have a couple questions there. One, what is that general cost? And two,
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:34.240]   at least in California, I've always heard this, "If you have less than $100,000 in assets,
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.920]   a will can avoid probate. So think about a trust when you cross that threshold."
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.120]   Is that still true? And what does the process look like?
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.760]   Yeah. So the probate process, it deals after death. It allows you to essentially
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.920]   prove that the will is valid, appoint the executor, carry out the terms of the will.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:58.080]   It seems like an orderly process. It's anything but. It can take, you know,
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.920]   measured typically in months or years. In California, a two-year probate is close to
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:10.560]   the norm these days. So the fees involved with probate, they vary by state, but then they also
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:16.880]   vary by the facts of your particular estate. In California, the threshold was recently raised,
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.480]   and it's now 184,000 of whether or not you can have some sort of short-form probate or if you
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.440]   have to have a full probate. Once you reach that threshold, the amount that you're actually going
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.080]   to pay in terms of fees and expenses, it's basically a percentage of the overall value
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.680]   of your assets. But as a quick example, if you have a million dollars of assets in California,
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:45.280]   you might look to pay maybe $50,000 of fees all out the door to get through the probate process.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.160]   And just to clarify, that million dollars is the gross value of your assets. So if you own a home
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.320]   and you're heavily mortgaged, you maybe have a million-dollar home and 200,000 of equity,
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:00.320]   you're still paying that 50,000 on the full $1 million value. You don't just look at the net
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:06.080]   value of your assets. That $50,000 can be a pretty heavy bill for someone to pay on top of their
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.120]   ongoing costs to maintain their standard of living. Where do those assets, they just pull
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.720]   those assets to pay for probate out of whatever you had in your bank account and whatnot and sell
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.240]   your investments and that kind of stuff? Yeah. If you have liquid assets available,
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.880]   they'll come from that. Otherwise, you might be forced to mortgage a house or even sell assets
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:30.240]   that are illiquid in order to generate these funds. And that can happen. You do see surviving
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.440]   spouses who have to sell the family home because they cannot come up with the cash to pay for
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.240]   probate or they can't maintain the mortgage payments after death, particularly with a loss
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:46.560]   of a source of income. So life insurance proceeds, it's a great opportunity to pair life insurance
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.440]   with your estate to ensure that there is cash available. But if you don't have that cash
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.800]   available, it's coming from other assets. And ultimately, it's going to reduce the amount
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.280]   that passes to your beneficiaries. So California, in many different ways,
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:07.360]   is a unique state. How do the other kind of 49 states and commonwealths and territories compare
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:16.080]   in terms of a hard threshold where things get really complicated? Or do many states offer that
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.840]   kind of short form version of probate that maybe isn't as daunting or expensive or timely?
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:27.040]   Yeah. Most other states are not quite as burdensome as California with respect to probate.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.600]   California, if it's not the worst, it's competing up there with maybe a couple other states to be
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:37.200]   among the worst states in terms of probate. A lot of other states, it's a more streamlined process.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.560]   It's maybe closer to filing your tax returns. You're filling out some documentation,
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.480]   submitting it. You got to have a lot of records to back it up. It's not quite as burdensome.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.360]   It doesn't take as long. It's not nearly as expensive, but it's still not enjoyable.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.200]   And so you have to bear in mind that you're doing this immediately following a death.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.440]   So there's a lot of emotion going on, a lot of just mental struggle happening. And then,
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.960]   "Hey, let me go fill out this really complicated equivalent to a tax return."
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:06.000]   It may be easier than California, but it's still something that a lot of people might look to avoid.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.080]   Without the fees of $50,000, you can definitely get away in a lot of other states without a trust.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:18.880]   So you don't necessarily have to have a trust in every state, every situation as a universal rule.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.800]   Many people still want to trust because it does have other benefits outside of probate. Those
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.920]   additional control over distributions and the privacy benefits, but it's not necessarily the
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:34.080]   probate factor alone requiring the use of a trust. Are there other states that if someone's listening
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.800]   and in that aren't California that are equally challenging or maybe not as challenging,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.600]   but states where a trust might make a little bit more sense?
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.600]   Yeah. So there are a couple of states. So New York is actually fairly difficult,
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.680]   not surprising. It has a lot in common with California. You also get some interesting
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.080]   things like Cook County in Illinois, not the whole state of Illinois, but Cook County in
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:59.040]   Illinois can be difficult to go through the probate process. So as a general rule, if you're in a
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.960]   bigger city or a higher net worth area, you tend to have a little bit more going on. The courts
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.760]   might be more congested. So the whole process just gets a little more bogged down. If you're in the
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.800]   Midwest, most of the states that tends to move a little more efficiently. So if you aren't sure
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.320]   what your local rules might apply to you, just think about what it looks like if you were to go
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.400]   to the county courthouse and try to get any sort of application. Is that relatively easy or is that
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.840]   something you don't want to look forward to doing? And that should give you a direction of which way
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.040]   to lean on how bad probate might be. I've gone through a couple different
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:35.920]   processes in my life setting all these documents up. One time I had a legal benefit at work where
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:41.040]   it turns out I could enroll. And I just did it for one year. I paid a couple, maybe $15 a month.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:46.480]   And at the end of it, I was able to go hire an attorney to drop these docs. And then full
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:52.160]   disclosure, once we had our first child, I used trust and will. And that's how we put together
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.760]   our whole estate plan. And I'm a big fan of the product. I'm not getting paid. You guys didn't
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:05.840]   pay to come on. I just like the product. I've talked about it before. I am curious for people
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:12.560]   listening, when does it make sense to download the template of a will that I'm sure there's lots of
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:17.520]   free legal will templates? Maybe even the state provides one. When does it make sense to use a
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.040]   service like trust and will or others that help you automate and create documents that you don't
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.600]   have to fill out yourself? And when do you get to the point that it makes sense to work with an
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:35.040]   attorney to drop something a little bit more custom? Yeah. So the hard part of trusting any
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:40.480]   sort of free document is knowing, is this actually valid? Has this been updated? Does this reflect
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:46.560]   the current laws? If I create this document, do I get what I think I'm actually expecting
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.560]   to receive here? I would say what you're paying for, but that's nothing. So are you really getting
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.000]   what you're expecting there? And unfortunately, I've looked at many of these free templates and
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.080]   sometimes they're just not valid. So there's that huge risk there of what you get. Some of them are
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:04.000]   good. So I'm not saying it's impossible to do it. And in some states, you can just pull out a piece
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.400]   of paper and handwrite your will and you're good. You're out the door. The mechanics of it are less
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.280]   difficult than somehow knowing what to say to carry out your intentions. So that's where you
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.240]   might want to look at something like Trust and Will. And if you need to make a quick comparison,
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.560]   Trust and Will is kind of like TurboTax for state planning. So yeah, you can download the forms in
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:27.840]   the IRS and fill out your 1040 on your own, but most people would rather have a guided experience
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.080]   through a tech platform like TurboTax. It just seems to make it all a little more
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.440]   comfort inspiring. You get more peace of mind, a little bit easier.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.280]   Trust and Will, we really handle most needs for most people where we really start to have some
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.360]   situations where you might want to go to an attorney. If you have really complex situations
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:50.160]   or if you're expecting a fight after your death, it's probably worth it to go see an attorney.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:55.120]   Or once you get into really high net worth individuals, if you're over about $5 million,
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.000]   we can still handle that at Trust and Will. Our documents are sophisticated enough to handle those
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.360]   situations up to and including a taxable estate, 12 or 15, $20 million of total wealth.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.360]   But you're probably going to get a better value if you actually go and pay the $5,000,
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:14.880]   $10,000 to have a custom document drafted by your attorney. $5,000, if you have $20 million in the
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:20.080]   bank, not that big of a blow to you. But $5,000, if you maybe have $500,000 in the bank, it starts
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.920]   to be a little harder to swallow that bill. That's really where Trust and Will fits in for most
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:29.280]   people. Any other circumstances that might make someone say, "Okay, maybe working with an attorney
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:33.680]   does make sense?" Well, special needs children is a particularly difficult situation. There's
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.920]   a specific type of planning that can be done for that. Trust and Will doesn't currently offer that,
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.280]   although that's something that's on our roadmaps. We hope to have that offered soon.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.920]   But that particular situation, if you want to account for a beneficiary who has special needs,
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:50.800]   it's a great option to go say, "Hey, maybe an attorney is better for my use case." Beyond that,
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:56.160]   if you have things like a prenup that requires certain payments to be made at death, or even a
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.560]   divorce decree or a marital settlement agreement that says, "Upon my death, I ensure that I'm
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.760]   going to leave X amount to my former spouse." You may need to have custom language inserted
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.480]   into your documents. Typically, only an attorney can provide that and ensure that the language in
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.480]   your documents complies with the requirements of that prenup or that marital agreement.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.280]   If you have a situation where you may think everybody's unique, and I don't want to say
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.520]   anybody is boilerplate, no one's template. But if you have a situation where you go,
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.640]   "I just feel like I'm not a good fit for this particular reason." You get that tingly feeling,
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.880]   that might be enough to at least call an attorney, see what they say. Maybe you could find some
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.000]   help. Maybe they go, "Oh, yeah, I can easily handle this. It's not a problem." And you get
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.360]   a little guidance from them. But you kind of maybe use your own best judgment. If you feel that you
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.280]   aren't going to be a good fit, you probably are worth paying a little bit more just to get the
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:50.320]   peace of mind of having an attorney involved. Are there any financial or tax benefits other
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:56.160]   than avoiding probate costs that come with setting up a will? Or sorry, come with setting up a trust?
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:04.480]   So trust can have some tax savings opportunities, both on a federal state tax or even a state tax.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.440]   For most people, that's not applicable. The current federal state tax thresholds are so high
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.520]   that it's just not something most people have to care about. But a trust can be used to at least
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:18.480]   efficiently pass assets without incurring additional taxes. So if it's something that
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.360]   you're concerned about, it can do that. But on the flip side of that, the trust also doesn't
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:28.560]   really incur any additional taxes. While you're alive, a revocable living trust is essentially
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:34.240]   disregarded from federal tax viewpoint. It's your alter ego. It's moving assets from your left pocket
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.040]   into your right pocket. You don't need a new taxpayer ID number. You don't have to file a
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:44.480]   separate tax return for assets in your trust. It's known as a grantor trust. But that just means
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.520]   it's no change. So it's held in this vehicle of a trust that provides a lot of benefits,
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.360]   but it won't negatively impact your tax status while you're still alive.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:59.280]   As someone who's gone through this process, usually you fill out a form, sign it, send it in,
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:03.680]   the bank and the account now has a new title, but it's still your same account. You still get
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.160]   your debit card with your name on it. It doesn't really change a whole lot. So I think when it
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:13.360]   comes to a lot of the trust we'll talk about in a bit, the irrevocable ones, that changes a lot of
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:20.400]   things. But in this circumstance, I think it just, it feels more fancy and technical because of the
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.440]   way we've seen it in the media about kids with trust funds than it is actually more a document
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:31.520]   to kind of just keep things more organized. But one of the questions that you have to figure out
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:40.960]   is who's going to be the trustee of the trust if you were to pass and usually that is you and your
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.760]   spouse might create it and the spouse takes over. Can you talk a little bit about that decision?
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.360]   Because I think some people listening are probably going to go through this and have to think, "Okay,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:54.000]   who is going to manage these financial affairs? And let's say my kids are young and they're not
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.600]   ready for the money. What happens to it? How do those decisions get made?"
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.920]   So the trustee, they're kind of like the CEO of the trust. They have a lot of administrative and
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:07.760]   financial responsibilities. And that includes everything from keeping records, paying taxes
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:13.040]   after death, making sure the distributions are actually made. They also work with a lot of
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.080]   professional advisors, whether it's a lawyer, an accountant, somebody like that. They have a lot of
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:24.000]   maybe more sophisticated requirements. And so you also want to make sure that you have
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   someone that understands you and your decisions because they still have to exercise their own
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.640]   discretion. Sometimes it's not a black and white decision. The trustee has to make a choice.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.080]   You want to make sure that that choice that is made is one that you would agree with.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.960]   So choosing someone who can handle all of those duties well, it can be difficult.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.960]   You're right. Most people do look to name a spouse or a child or a family member as their
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.440]   trustee. But if you don't have a spouse or if your children are very young, they may not be
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:55.840]   good choices. You can look to name a sibling or a parent, but is that the right person?
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.240]   It's ultimately going to depend on what's right for you. The most common choices are spouse and
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:07.280]   children and other near family members, close friends are a common option. There are business
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.680]   partners that you can choose if you have a close working relationship. But if none of those apply,
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.880]   there are professional fiduciaries or even a bank who can step in and serve as trustee.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.280]   They charge a fee for it, but it's more of a corporate approach. You know what you're getting,
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:26.640]   you're opting into. I am choosing to have this bank serve as my trustee. They're going to make
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.720]   very corporate decisions. But sometimes that's good if you don't have another alternative that
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.080]   you can comfortably rely on to fill in and make those decisions for you.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:41.360]   For our circumstances, we didn't want to leave our children who right now are one about to be
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.560]   born and two years old with money at that age, which I don't even know if you could legally do.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.920]   So this person was going to have to manage our assets until the right age, which meant
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:57.680]   managing the investments. What happens when the funds that you're invested in pay dividends? Do
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:04.240]   you reinvest them? When do you change asset classes? If you look at a trust that was maybe
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.200]   written 10 years ago, you probably never thought maybe you'd want to invest some percentage of
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   your portfolio in cryptocurrency, but now you might. So for us, we thought about who can make
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:20.640]   those kinds of investment decisions. And it was just a very different calculus than who do we
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:27.840]   want to take care of our children? Those are just fundamentally very different. And so we didn't
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:33.200]   choose the same person for that. And it was much more of an investment kind of mindset that we
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:39.040]   wanted someone to think about and be fair with money. Because I think, am I right calling them
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:45.360]   HIMSS clauses? There's like a phrase of what kind of discretion you give the trustee over things.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.880]   And that kind of really helped me think about who could make those decisions.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.400]   Yeah. It's a really important point. And it is a HIMSS clause, H-E-M-S,
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.920]   health, education, maintenance, and support. You can talk to your favorite lawyer about it, but
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:01.120]   it provides certain instruction as the terms of when assets can be paid out to a beneficiary or
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:07.280]   when assets have to be held in the trust. But the bigger point is the person who fills the role of
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:12.720]   the trustee best for you may not be the person who fills the role of guardian or fills the role
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.920]   of executor, fills the role of your power of attorney. So the default many people think is,
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:23.040]   "I'm going to name my spouse for everything." But that may work, but maybe your spouse isn't
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.040]   the person who wants to handle these complex financial situations. So maybe you want to name
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.360]   your spouse to care for your children, obviously, and make personal decisions for you. Maybe you
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.160]   want to name your brother who's a tax lawyer to handle your financial investment decisions if
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.800]   that's more suitable for your particular needs. So you don't have to name one person in every
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.120]   role. You can name individuals that are suited for each particular role. You want to make sure
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.680]   they're kind of coordinated and able to work together. But each role should be kind of accounted
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.800]   for different or as a one-off, if you will. So it can be someone that serves another role,
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:59.200]   but it doesn't have to be one person filling every fiduciary role throughout your estate plan.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:05.920]   And one thing we did, which I think isn't required, but we kind of wrote a side letter
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:12.800]   for the successor trustee because they have this ability to control the health, the education,
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:18.080]   the maintenance, how much... Do the kids go to private school or not? That's a financial decision.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:23.040]   The trustee would get to decide that. So we just wrote a letter to that person and said, "We want
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:29.040]   you to know that here's how we would think about spending money on our children. Would we want them
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:35.440]   to have some money to go on vacations or study abroad?" Things like that, where it was less
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.760]   about we thought this person would make the wrong decision, but we just wanted to make it easier for
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:45.520]   them to make the decision we would have made. So while I don't think you guys have built in a
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.920]   feature to write a letter to a friend, which doesn't really need a product, but that is
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:54.800]   something that we did on the side, just to make sure that we weren't doing what a lot of people
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:59.920]   do. And if you Google online, there's some crazy Reddit posts about people saying, "Well, did you
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:05.440]   decide that my kids will only be able to pay for... The trust will only pay for their college if they
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:11.760]   get above a 3.7." And then someone said, "Well, I don't know. What if it's a 3.6?" And you get into
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:17.520]   these really tough situations where if a kid were to get sick or have an accident, maybe their GPA
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:23.440]   drops. Now you don't pay for their college. And so we took the approach of not trying to outline
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.520]   every little nuance of everything that would happen, but to choose a person we trusted
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:32.000]   and give them some guidance and give them the discretion to make those decisions.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.800]   That's always been my professional recommendation. It's really hard to predict the future,
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.720]   but it's a lot easier to find someone that you trust and give them direction.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.480]   And then ultimately, you're just relying on them to make the best choice that they can.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.480]   As a parent, that's all you're trying to do every day is make the best choice that you can in a
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.320]   situation. Nobody knows what next year is going to be like. If you'd asked us 5 years ago, "Were
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.800]   we going to have a global pandemic?" No one would have raised their hand. If those of you who did,
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.280]   we would have looked at it with skeptical eyes. But you can't predict the future. But what you
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.920]   can do is you can pick people you trust. And if you can do that, and you can give them the guidance
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.240]   in that letter of instruction, it may not be legally binding, but it's helpful. And sometimes
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.520]   helpful is all you need. Do you have to tell or do you recommend telling all of these people this
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.960]   thing? I know that one of the decisions that we had to make was, "Gosh, who we might want now?"
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.400]   We actually thought about it in hindsight. We said, "Gosh, if we had to make this decision
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:30.080]   5 years ago, some of those people are people that we're not as close to anymore."
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.280]   Or maybe something happens to them. And we thought, "Gosh, if we tell the person who
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:40.080]   is the trustee or the guardian now, and then we change it, that's going to be pretty awkward to
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.920]   be like, 'Hey, I know for the last 4 years, I've thought you'd be good to manage my affairs.'
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.600]   I changed my mind." Is this something you have to tell people about?
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:53.840]   You don't have to tell anybody. You don't have to. But generally, it's a good idea to tell people.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:59.600]   And when I say good idea, what I mean is having that conversation in advance is one of the easiest
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:06.480]   ways to avoid conflict or disagreement or dispute after death. You save so much hassle by having
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.200]   that conversation up front. It's not easy. People don't want to have that conversation about death
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.920]   in most cases. But it also doesn't have to be hard. It can be as simple as, "Hey,
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:22.240]   I've created an estate plan, and I've named you as trustee. Are you okay with that? Also,
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.320]   here's where my documents are in case something happens to me." You don't have to get into the
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:31.440]   details, but you can at least inform people of the decisions. And if those decisions change later,
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:36.720]   it can be as simple as, "Hey, I've updated my estate plan. I've named someone else as trustee
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.200]   to fill these needs right now. But I still have these documents in this place." Or, "You're still
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.880]   serving as my power of attorney." Whatever the update may be. People respect the information.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:52.560]   It's ultimately your choice. And is it worth trying to save an awkward conversation now
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.240]   if you know that the likelihood is that you're going to wind up having
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.000]   your family, your heirs, your beneficiaries dealing with that situation later on?
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.920]   Most people, when they think about it, say, "I'd rather just go ahead and get this out of the way
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:08.720]   and have maybe an awkward conversation. But I know I'm not going to have a fight that I'm leaving for
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:14.000]   my family after my death." "I created my estate plan. Things change in life. How do you think
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.560]   about when it makes sense to update them? Is that something you do every year or every time you have
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:24.640]   a major life event?" Many people think of estate planning as a one-and-done situation. Unfortunately,
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:29.760]   it's not that way. Estate planning should be something that evolves with your life. What's
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:35.200]   good for you now may not be what's good for you in 5, 10, 20 years from now. Your estate plan
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.600]   should change as your life changes as well. There's a simple rule at Trust & Will. We think
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:45.280]   that after any major life events, you should look to update your estate plan. If there's been a
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.360]   birth or a death, a change in marital status, anything like that, take a look at your estate
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:53.600]   plan. But even if you haven't had any major changes and you look at your plan and you go,
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:59.680]   "Everything's about how I still want this to be," every 3-5 years, it's worth just reviewing your
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:04.080]   plan, maybe even refreshing it because the laws do sometimes change. You want to make sure that
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.240]   you don't have a stale or an outdated plan. You want to make sure that your plan continues to
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:13.600]   represent your interests and your desires. Any major life events, every 3-5 years, or if you
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.360]   have some specific change, you need a new guardian, anything like that, go ahead and take a
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.360]   look. Update your plan. It's really not that hard to get a plan updated once you have the first plan
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.960]   in place. Great.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:29.120]   And you just mentioned where you keep the documents. I'll share a company that I started
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:34.560]   using on my own called Trustworthy, which is basically this family operating system where
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:40.000]   you store all the documents that, while you're alive, are great for just managing between your
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:47.120]   partner. And were you to pass, you can actually nominate people who find out in advance that
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:50.800]   were something to happen, they could reach out to the company and get access to.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:56.560]   So we've put things like our estate plan, our insurance documents, just where we hold bank
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:02.960]   accounts and financial accounts, all those kinds of different things we put there. And then just
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.200]   sent a few friends that we trusted. Here's where they are. If something happens to us,
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:12.480]   you know where to get them. So that's another company like Trust and Will that I use.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.480]   So my Trust and Will docs are in my Trustworthy account online.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.760]   That's great. Trust and Will, we've recently added the ability to upload additional documents to be
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.960]   stored with your estate plan. It's a slightly different approach. Ours is typically focused
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.200]   more on the estate planning side. But the ultimate goal is to make sure that all the documents that
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.640]   you need, which includes your estate plan and things like your insurance documents,
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.000]   other important information, they're available to the people who need them.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.560]   So absolutely, find a solution for that because having a will is the first step.
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.760]   But having a will that no one can find doesn't do you any good.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.760]   You need to make sure that people know where that is, how to access it when they need it.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   So it's important to have the document, but make sure that it's also still accessible when it's
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:56.320]   needed. I've talked to a few people that have gone through this process. And unfortunately,
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.480]   they got held up at the last step, which is getting all these documents signed and notarized.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:07.200]   It's been a couple years for me. Has anything evolved in the world of online notaries,
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:11.600]   such that getting your documents signed and executed in a way that they're
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:17.840]   enforceable by law is easier than driving to a notary or having a notary come to your house?
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:23.600]   A little bit, but not enough. Estate planning, particularly wills are the last lingering
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.840]   holdout in e-signatures and electronic notification online notarization.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.760]   You still typically have to have a paper document that you physically sign
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:35.600]   with physical witnesses watching you sign it and take it to a notary.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:39.200]   It's very old school, very complex. There has been some improvement.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:44.400]   There are up to about 10 or 12 states now that have digital wills and the electronic will law.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:49.200]   So you can create and sign a document entirely digitally and make it a valid will.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.880]   It looks like that's going to be a continuing trend. And so hopefully,
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.560]   more and more states will have that each year, but it is a slow process.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:03.120]   So it's still not the easiest thing to do. But it's also not that hard. You can go to a FedEx
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:08.320]   store or something like that, pay a few bucks, get a notary, AAA store, ARP office. There are
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:12.720]   lots of places to get a notary who can help you out. So the little bit of effort you have to put
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.600]   in, it's more than it should be, but it's not enough to let you avoid having a plan in place.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:23.200]   That makes a lot of sense. Ask your bank. Some banks I've found are willing to do
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.920]   notarization for free. Some of them are only willing to do it on non-estate planning related
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:34.080]   documents. So we were fortunate when we were doing some stuff with real estate that Wells Fargo was
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.520]   willing to notarize things for free. We were unfortunate that they were not willing to
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:43.680]   notarize any estate planning documents. So we did a search on Yelp. We messaged some
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:48.000]   mobile notaries and I was surprised that it was less expensive than I thought to get it all done
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.360]   at once. We actually walked across the street to our neighbor's house and did it all there.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:59.360]   So we weren't asking them to be our witnesses and having to drive down. So that's another option
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:07.680]   for anyone listening. Are there any other outside of the basics of document creation and some of
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.920]   the stuff that I've written about or talked about that you think people should be thinking about?
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:18.400]   Let's call it other tips, tricks, hacks on protecting your family,
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.480]   things that you've picked up along the way that are worth sharing.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:25.600]   Well, I think the recommendation that I always give is to have that discussion upfront. Tell
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.680]   people what your plans are. And if you have a plan, let people know, "I have a plan.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.400]   Here's where it's located." Maybe fill them in on some details. That is the number one tip.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:40.080]   But beyond that, you can really consider the importance of having backups plan in place.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:44.720]   You want to think about trying to over-plan rather than under-planning for any situation.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:50.800]   So your situation is unique. What I plan for may not meet your needs. What you plan for may not be
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:56.400]   appropriate for my needs. So if you are worried about some particular specific scenario that may
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:00.640]   only apply to you, or even if it may never apply to you, but it's just this nagging doubt in your
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:06.320]   head, plan for it. Put a provision in place that will buy you that peace of mind just to know that
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:11.440]   you have something there. That peace of mind, that self-confidence that is worth its weight in gold
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.400]   for so many people. The relief that people feel once they've completed this process, they then
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:21.600]   wonder, "Why did I put this off so long? This was A, not that hard. And B, I feel so much better."
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:27.920]   But the last tip to make sure that your family has a plan in place as well. So if you have kids
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.760]   and they're getting to the age of 18, talk to them about estate planning. It's awkward. It's
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:37.200]   difficult, but you're a parent, you have to guide them into becoming adults as well. But if you have
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:41.360]   siblings or parents that don't have a plan, guess who's going to be stuck dealing with that mess?
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:46.800]   You are. So yeah, it's a bit of a self-interested conversation, but talk to your family members.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.280]   Do you have a plan in place? What do you want to happen? You can start that conversation
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:56.800]   and ultimately not rely on them to start it, but you can start that conversation and you're still
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.800]   both going to be better off for having raised the topic with your family members as well.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:06.560]   Any tips for that conversation? I imagine at least in my circumstance, my parents had never
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:11.600]   really talked to me about their plans or anything like that. But I can see how it can come off a
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:15.760]   little bit like, "Hey, how much money am I going to get when you die?" That kind of conversation.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:21.120]   Any suggestions for broaching the topic in the best way possible?
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:26.000]   The easiest way to raise it is to start with yourself and say, "Hey, I've created an estate
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.480]   plan. Here's where it's located." But it made me think, "Do you have an estate plan?
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:35.840]   What can I know to ensure that your wishes are carried out after your death?" And that's the
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:40.720]   focus is what can I do to ensure that you get what you've planned for? You don't have to talk
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:45.280]   about specific assets. And if it comes up that like, "Hey, you've been named as my guardian
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:50.160]   for my children," then you can have the conversation of, "Okay, well, what would you like to happen for
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.600]   your kids? Would you want them to go to private school or public school? Do you want to go to
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   summer camp? What should you tell me that I can be as best a guardian as possible for your plans?"
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:04.880]   Ultimately, you're trying to learn how to fill that expectation as best as possible.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:09.200]   And if you focus on it that way, most people don't see that as, "Oh, you're trying to figure
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:14.000]   out what you're going to get when I die." It's not money-grubbing, greedy. It's really, "Oh,

[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.440]   I love it. It's been great. I enjoy speaking with you.
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:20.880]   When we think about trust, we think about more advanced things. And so I'm not the expert here.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:27.040]   I wanted to talk to someone who I think really understands all of the advanced tactics people
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:32.800]   are using to both avoid taxes now, avoid taxes in the future, be able to transfer money to their
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:39.040]   children. So I'm really excited to bring on Mani from Valor, who has built an entire business
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.840]   around this that's really interesting. Mani, thanks for joining me.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:47.840]   Really appreciate it, Chris. Excited to join you. And I'll give you a little bit of context on
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.800]   those things that you're talking about. And so to give you context on ourselves,
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:58.480]   at Valor, our entire idea is how do we use technology to make these tax and estate planning
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:02.080]   tactics more accessible so that everyone can build wealth more efficiently?
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.400]   And the problem we're solving is most of these things, your audience may know about it,
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:11.520]   you may know about it, but it's a black box to most people. But let's start at the top of
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.800]   what is tax planning and estate planning, which you've both mentioned.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:19.760]   When most people think about tax planning, it's how do they use legal tax rules,
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:25.120]   things that the IRS has okayed, or the government has okayed, to reduce their taxes? So this could
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:30.000]   be their taxes on their salary, their capital gains, their stock they've received from their
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.960]   company, or their side hustles. It's how do you take advantage of whatever rules and opportunities
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:40.400]   the government has laid out to reduce your taxes so you can keep as much income for your use during
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:46.800]   your lifetime? That's kind of what tax planning is really focused on. Now, estate planning is
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:51.440]   thinking about a little bit longer time horizon. It's taking the assets and the wealth that you,
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:57.040]   your family have built up, and how do you pass on as much of that as possible to the next generation?
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:02.800]   And kind of the big constraint here is the lifetime gift exemption. So I know this is
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:08.560]   something you probably know about, Chris, but in the US, you're allowed to give, there's a
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:13.840]   limitation on how much you can gift in assets to other people before the government starts to tax
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:21.440]   it. So as of now, the individual limit is a little above $12 million. So that means as an individual,
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:27.200]   you can give $12 million, or as a couple, a little above $24 million before the government starts to
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:32.560]   tax your assets with the estate tax. - Which is a really high rate, right?
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:38.800]   - Yeah, the estate tax is, it makes all other taxes look low. So just the federal tax rate
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:46.800]   alone is 40%. It does graduate, but it gets to 40% pretty quickly. And that's just federal. So
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.760]   then you can start to layer on state taxes on top of that, and it can get much, much higher.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:56.080]   Now, some of these state estate taxes actually start at levels below this $12 million,
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:01.440]   depends on a state by state basis, but the federal is the most punitive. And that's primarily what
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:05.600]   people are concerned about is, if they're trying to pass on as much of their hard-earned wealth to
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:11.920]   their kids or grandchildren, how do they work around the estate tax? And this is where estate
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:15.680]   planning comes into play. So it's a little bit different time horizon of, are you focused on,
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:20.720]   how do you maximize assets for your use? Or how do you maximize assets for future generations,
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.600]   or some combination? And that's where more of these different structures come into play,
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.800]   like irrevocable trust. - Yeah, and we've talked a bit
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:33.920]   earlier about the basics of estate planning. And I think what you're doing is interesting,
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:38.720]   because it marries the two a little bit. Some of the tactics that we'll talk about are things that
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:45.360]   you might be able to use, even if you're nowhere close to hitting $24 million with a spouse. And
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:51.600]   some of them might be less ideal, or not worth it if you're not that close. And just so everyone
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:56.080]   knows, I'm not an attorney. Monte, I don't think you're an attorney. This is not meant to be
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:01.760]   personalized financial or tax advice. But we're just gonna explore some of these tactics that I
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:06.960]   think are really mystified. You hear trust and people are like, "Oh, they're so fancy." I just
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.520]   wanna break down a bunch of them and walk through them so people understand what they are, how they
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:19.920]   work, how people are legally either avoiding or postponing taxes, and for many people, how they
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.240]   could fit into their lives and when they make sense. - Yeah, that sounds great.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:29.120]   - I wrote a newsletter a few months ago, and I did my own research. And I'm not the expert
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:34.400]   like you are. And I found... I'd known about a few of these, and I wrote about Gratz,
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.040]   and Charitable Remainder Trusts, and Islets, and Family Limited Partnerships. Those are the
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:44.000]   things I highlighted and wrote a paragraph on. And even in just preparing for this interview
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.520]   and looking at your company, I realized, "Gosh, I really didn't know what I was talking about then."
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:53.440]   And I caveated it with, "I don't know what I'm talking about, but this is my quick research." So
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:58.240]   I'm glad we can clear things up. So maybe we start with Charitable Remainder Trusts.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:04.000]   - At a high level, Charitable Remainder Trusts are typically used for people when they're selling
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.560]   highly appreciated assets, because you can take advantage of... Their core thing is their tax
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:15.440]   exempt structure. And the easiest way to understand these, and the most relatable thing is, for most
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:21.760]   people is, Charitable Remainder Trusts are very similar to a standard IRA that most Americans use
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:28.080]   to build their wealth. IRAs, just as a quick reminder, it's Individual Retirement Accounts,
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:33.520]   and the core benefit for most people is that you can contribute between $5,000 to $8,000 per year
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:40.960]   to your IRA, and the assets grow in your IRA on a tax-free basis. Until you take money out of the
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:47.600]   IRA, you can buy and sell the assets, and you won't pay taxes. And this is to the power of compound
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:53.920]   wealth, which your audience obviously knows a lot about. It creates an incredible amount of wealth
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:58.800]   for people over a long time period. Charitable Remainder Trusts are very similar to that. They're
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:04.880]   also a tax-exempt structure where assets that are sold in the trust, you don't pay taxes on
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:12.720]   until you receive a distribution from the trust. Now, the big difference and where this comes into
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:17.040]   play is, there's a couple key differences. One, you can contribute an unlimited amount of assets
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:22.160]   to a Charitable Remainder Trust instead of being limited to $5,000 to $8,000. So kind of a common
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:26.880]   use case is if someone has paid off the mortgage on their house that they've lived in for 20 years,
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:33.040]   and they want to sell it. They can't put it into their IRA, but they could move that house into a
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:39.440]   Charitable Remainder Trust and then sell it and avoid the taxes on when they sell their house and
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:44.880]   reinvest that money. So just to take kind of a quick example, let's just say the house is worth
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:50.880]   a million dollars. And to keep numbers simple, their cost basis was close to zero when they
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:55.760]   bought it. So they bought in a really great place that's exploded in value. If they lived in
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:03.280]   California, they would probably, when they sell it, pay 35% or $350,000 in taxes and take away
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:08.880]   650 grand if they didn't do anything. But instead, if they put it into a Charitable Remainder Trust,
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:14.240]   they would upfront get about 10% of that value as a charitable deduction to write off their income.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:18.960]   So $100,000 charitable deduction. But critically, when they sell that million-dollar home,
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:24.720]   the trust wouldn't owe any taxes on it. So it would keep a million dollars to reinvest,
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:29.760]   to put into the market, or any of the other investment options that they're looking at.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:34.480]   And just kind of with simple math of if a million dollars invested at the market versus $650,000,
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:40.800]   you're going to generate a lot more income and wealth for yourself. That's kind of the key piece.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:45.120]   So let's say you work at a company, you've got some shares. When they were granted to you,
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:49.520]   they're really inexpensive and you exercise them. Now they're worth a lot. Yeah,
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:54.800]   you could pay taxes and invest it. Or you could contribute these to a Charitable Remainder Trust
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:00.240]   and then not pay the taxes because it is a charitable vehicle. And you get a deduction
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:04.400]   for that donation. And then the trust can use that full million dollars to keep investing it.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:11.360]   So if you otherwise were going to donate a million dollars to charity, that seems comparable. But can
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:16.880]   you talk a little bit about how this is not just something that is beneficial to charity, which it
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:23.200]   is, but it also is beneficial to you? Yeah, it's a great question. This is where a lot of people
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:26.880]   wondering like, why is it called a Charitable Remainder Trust? And kind of the way that this
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:31.200]   works is every year from a Charitable Remainder Trust, or at least annually, you're allowed to
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:36.400]   take money out of the Charitable Remainder Trust. That amount is set up front when you create the
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:41.280]   trust of what percentage of trust assets it is. But that's kind of the critical thing is the core
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:46.960]   part of this is that you're expected to get 90% of the value out of the trust, and the charity is
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:54.640]   expected to be left about 10%. And that 10% that you leave behind, this is what enables the structure
[00:59:54.640 --> 01:00:01.040]   to stay tax exempt, so assets can grow. And you only give that 10% at the end of the trust term.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:06.800]   And for most folks, this is at the end of their life. So they'll take their highly appreciated
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:11.360]   equity in the company, they'll put it into Charitable Remainder Trust, they'll sell it,
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:16.960]   they'll keep that entire principle in the trust, reinvest it, and then every year,
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:22.400]   they can start to take distributions from that trust. And then at the end, they'll leave a
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:27.600]   little bit piece when they pass away, that'll go to a charitable cause that they care about.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.240]   So it's kind of a... The easiest way to think about it is the government is giving you kind
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:36.960]   of a 0% interest loan on your taxes, so that you can reinvest it in the market in exchange for
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:40.320]   leaving a small percentage for charity at the end of the trust.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:46.480]   Yeah. And I've seen the calculators you make on your website. And because you're able to
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:53.280]   invest money without paying taxes and grow it along the way, it turns out you end up
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:59.120]   over your lifetime, usually with more money coming back than you would have otherwise.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.800]   So you actually... The charity benefits and you benefit.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.960]   Yeah, that's 100% right. If you're selling an appreciated asset, or if you live in a high
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:15.040]   tax state, you will come out ahead personally by using a Charitable Remainder Trust to sell
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.520]   the asset and do the money that you receive over time by being able to avoid that taxes.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.680]   And as like a cherry on top, a charitable cause will also benefit. But even if you ignore that
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.600]   piece, you will personally benefit. And if you really care about the charitable cause,
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.240]   then it's a real kind of win-win all around.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:37.440]   Now, I know what you give up is a little bit of liquidity. So can you talk about the trade-off is
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:43.040]   that million dollars in my example, you can't take it all out next year if you wanted it.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.000]   Yeah, exactly. It's a great call out of... The way these Charitable Remainder Trusts work is
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.760]   every year you can take out a certain percentage of the assets. This is the downside and the benefit
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:02:00.480]   is if you sold all those assets personally in your name, that $650,000 after taxes,
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:05.280]   you can pull it out and do whatever you want with it at any time. The Charitable Remainder Trust,
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.320]   you can only withdraw a certain percentage per year. That percent depends on how long you set
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.280]   the trust up for. But let's just say you can pull out 10% a year. Instead of if there's a million
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:20.400]   dollars in the trust, that means you can pull out $100,000 that year. Now, that means that you don't
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.760]   have access to that full $650,000 or a million dollars. So you have less upfront liquidity.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.400]   And this is one of the key trade-offs you're making, is you get less upfront liquidity
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:37.280]   in exchange for your assets being able to stay in a tax-free environment and continuing to
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:43.280]   compound and grow on a pre-tax basis. So it's a little bit of the, "Do you need the money now,
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.760]   or are you trying to create more long-term wealth?" And that tilts the, "Should you sell it
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.720]   in your name or should you use this structure?" And it's not all or nothing. So if in a given year,
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:57.520]   you were to make $2 million, you don't have to put all $2 million in any of these vehicles. You
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:03.440]   could put 10% of it or 20%, correct? Exactly. So for instance, we have some
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:09.760]   customers who are tech employees. And as part of the IPOs last year, they had a couple million
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.520]   exit for their assets. And they ended up putting 50% into a shareholder remainder trust.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.320]   And then they sold the other 50% in their own name to buy a home. So it depends. It's not all
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.640]   or nothing. And there's also one of the big benefits of these shareholder remainder trusts
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:29.680]   is you don't have to put in all the assets up front. You can add assets. You can put a little
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.480]   bit of assets initially. You can add assets a year from now, two years from now. They're fairly
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:41.440]   flexible. So you don't have to make the decision up front. Now, this is an irrevocable trust,
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.640]   which is part of why you get these tax benefits. So once you do put assets in,
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.880]   you can't decide to change your mind after the fact. But you will start to get those distributions.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:58.320]   And you don't have to make that big decision up front. You can set up, put a little bit in,
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:03.360]   add more over time, or you can split your shares up. So it's fairly flexible that way.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:08.160]   And ultimately, what people do just depends on your life situation. Do you have a lot of
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.880]   big purchases coming out? Or life events changing in your life? Do you plan to take some time off?
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.040]   Or do you not need the money and you want to reinvest it and create more long-term wealth for
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.560]   years down the line when your kid's going to school or you want to take a couple years off
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.920]   from working? That tends to be very situational dependent based on the person, their lifestyle,
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.840]   what their needs are. One quick follow up. So yes, it's irrevocable. You can't take the money
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:34.480]   out. But how much control do you have over the investment? Can you set it up in a way that you
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:40.800]   have just a brokerage account and you can go in and trade and buy anything? Yeah, you can be in
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.720]   charge of making your own investment. You can set it up to have a robo-advisor control it. You can
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.720]   set it up so that you're making those investments. Charitable remainder trust, one of the great
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.680]   things is you can invest in almost any asset. There's really just two restrictions. And this
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:00.880]   is similar to self-directed IRAs for people that are familiar with it. There's what's called a
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:06.320]   self-dealing prohibition where you can't invest in assets that you will personally benefit from.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:11.040]   So for instance, the charitable remainder trust could invest in a rental property for real estate,
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:15.600]   which it's allowed to do, but you couldn't buy a rental property and then live in it yourself.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:22.160]   So as long as it's a passive investment, you can invest in it, can invest in real estate, stocks,
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:30.320]   crypto, do angel investments for people in tech. There's a huge myriad of opportunities.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.680]   And really the restrictions are self-direct is self-dealing and taking leverage. You don't want
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:41.920]   to create debt inside of the charitable remainder trust. So you don't want to be taking high
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:47.520]   leveraged options or trades like that. But otherwise, it's a fairly flexible, which...
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:51.040]   So for most people, they don't have to change their investment philosophy or what they want
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:57.520]   to invest in or who's managing their investments. It fits into their lifestyle that way.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:03.520]   Awesome. Okay. So that's charitable remainder trust. I know grats are similar in that you
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.360]   often want to donate highly appreciated assets. Can you talk a little bit about how they're
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:14.000]   different? Yeah. So one key thing is, in most cases, the people that are benefiting from the
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.400]   charitable remainder trust are the same people who put the assets in. So if you set up a charitable
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.800]   remainder trust, in most cases, you're also going to be receiving those annual distributions from
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:28.160]   the trust and benefiting personally, financially. Grats, that's kind of in the tax planning
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:34.880]   situation. Grats fit more into the estate planning bucket of solutions, where grats are focused on
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:40.480]   how do you efficiently pass on assets from one generation to the next and are really focused on
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:46.960]   minimizing your estate taxes. So just to start with, grats stand for the grantor-attained annuity
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:53.440]   trust. And kind of an interesting aside, the way that they were created was the previous favorite
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:07:00.320]   estate planning tool was called a GRIT, and Congress tried to outlaw GRITs. And when they
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:05.600]   changed the legislation to outlaw GRITs, they actually created a loophole that enabled grats,
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:13.760]   which are significantly more exploitative towards avoiding estate taxes. So they took a broken
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:19.920]   system, they tried to make it better, broke it and made it worse. Now, how do grats work? Grats
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.360]   enable you, they essentially take advantage of, in most cases, an arbitrage between what is the
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:29.600]   government's discount rate, or what is the government's assumed growth rate of assets,
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:34.880]   and what do you actually achieve? So let's take kind of an example of saying you're starting with
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:40.720]   a million dollars, and let's say the government's interest rate is 2%, where it was not that long
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:46.400]   ago. Obviously, things are changing pretty quickly right now. So the government is assuming that
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:56.480]   a year from now on that million dollars, you're going to gain 2%, or $20,000. Now, and the way
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:01.520]   a grat is set up is that the grat, you set up for a number of years, and let's just say you set up
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:08.000]   for two years in this example, it is going to pay you a, what's called an annuity stream, which is
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.120]   why it's called a Grants Retained Annuity Trust, it's going to pay you a set amount of money.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:20.800]   Let's just say it's going to pay you $500,000 for two years. So in year one, it pays you $500,000.
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:27.040]   Now, the government is going to assume that there's $520,000 left in the trust, because they
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.640]   assume assets grow at 2% a year. And then in year two, it's going to pay you another $500,000,
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:42.560]   and it's going to assume that there's that $520,000 grew to $530,000 after, and left $30,000
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:48.560]   behind. That $30,000, from the government's point of view, is going to, in most cases, it's your kid
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.520]   or whoever you're trying to have inherit your assets. So the government assumes $30,000 passed
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:58.800]   on to your kid. Now, the reality that most of us know is your assets are probably going to grow
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:04.640]   faster than 2%, right? The historical market return of the S&P is a little above 10%. So let's
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:09.920]   say your assets are actually growing at 10% a year. So after year one, that million dollars
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:17.520]   is worth $1.1 million. Okay, you lose $500,000. There's $600,000 left. After that second year,
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:24.720]   when there's $600,000, there's now $660,000 left. That $500,000 then comes back to you,
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:30.800]   and then there's $160,000 left in the trust. The government, from its calculations,
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:38.560]   only says that you gifted $30,000 to whoever is the inheritor or the beneficiary of your grant,
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:44.640]   even though you passed $160,000 on. So this is where you can essentially pass on, in this case,
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:54.560]   $130,000 estate tax-free from a federal standpoint. And the big advantage here is the higher you can
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:59.360]   grow your assets than the government's interest rate, the more you can pass on and avoid the
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:05.280]   estate tax. And this is kind of your comment on highly appreciated assets, why it's become
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.600]   so valuable. If you take, let's just say, startup equity or something that has a low
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:13.440]   current market value, but you feel like there's a good bet in two years it's going to be worth
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:20.080]   10 or 100x that value, the government's assuming if you put it in, it's worth $10,000 today.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.800]   And let's just say, three years from now, it's going to be worth $10 million. The government
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:29.920]   is assuming that $10,000 is growing at 2% a year. So it's negligibly going to be worth
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:37.040]   nothing in 10 to $15,000 in three years. All of that upside passes on without paying the estate
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:44.160]   tax. That's so interesting. So it's probably not a tool that's useful to the average person who's
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:50.240]   not even coming close to $24 million. But if you own a business or you own a piece of a business
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:56.320]   that's worth 10s or 100s of millions of dollars, or you think you might, it could come into play.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:01.520]   But the purpose of this conversation is not to necessarily share every tactic that everyone
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:07.040]   listening can use, but to unveil the mystery behind some of these things we hear about.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:13.760]   And so it's fascinating to hear how... And your example, by the way, was just for 2 years. I
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:20.960]   assume if we continue that example for 20, 30 years, the compounding of the S&P at 10%
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.640]   leaves a whole lot more than $30,000 or what would have grown at 2%.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:32.080]   Yeah, exactly. Every year that you do this, you're able to leverage the difference between
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.080]   the government's assumed growth rate and what you can get to pass on even more value.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:42.160]   To this example, one of the more prominent examples was when before Facebook IPO'd
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:48.240]   Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Dustin Moskovitz, they all set up grats. They took
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:54.720]   the pre-IPO price of their Facebook shares, they put those shares in, they set up for I don't know
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:01.120]   how many years. And then after the IPO, when the price popped of Facebook, all that appreciation
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:07.440]   was able to pass on and avoid the estate tax. So this is to your point of if you have a family
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.800]   business that's worth eight or nine figures, or you're already above that, it's a really powerful
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:19.760]   tool to minimize those estate taxes and preserve as much of your hard-earned income for future
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:25.360]   generations. That's so fascinating. Okay, we got a lot to get through, but I want to come back to
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:31.920]   charitable lead trusts and less about appreciated assets, but still helpful to avoid taxes in a
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:39.200]   high-income year. Can you talk a little bit about those? So charitable lead trusts are... The long
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.240]   name of it is charitable lead annuity trusts. And this is a really powerful tool if you've got a big
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:50.560]   bonus or short-term capital gains or high ordinary income to be able to write off your income today.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.200]   And the way that this works is you set up this charitable lead trust for a number of years,
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.480]   let's just say 20 years, and you're putting money into, let's say you put a million dollars into a
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:05.680]   charitable lead trust. You get a million dollar charitable deduction today to write off your
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.760]   income, but you're not giving that entire million dollars away now, you're actually able to reinvest
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.240]   it. So you're able to take that million dollars, you put it in charitable lead trust, you put it
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:21.840]   into the market where it's going to grow 10% a year, 8% a year, whatever you assumed is,
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.840]   and you get a charitable deduction now. Probably wondering like, why would you get a charitable
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.080]   deduction now if you're not giving away the money? It's kind of similar in some sense to
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:36.000]   a donor advice fund, where with a charitable lead trust, you're promising in the future years to
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.360]   give away a set amount of money to a charitable cause. So it could be a donor advice fund,
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:45.520]   could be a foundation, could be the American Red Cross, but you're promising to do that in the
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:52.080]   future. And so you can say that in year two, I'm going to give $10,000, year three, $15,000,
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:57.120]   year four, $20,000. And when you are setting up this charitable lead trust, essentially the
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:01.760]   government is taking their interest rate, and they're figuring out what is the present value
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:10.000]   of their future donations. And so they're taking that and they're giving you an upfront charitable
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.360]   deduction for the present value of those future charitable deductions. Now, a big part of this
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:22.560]   advantage is that discount rate that they're using, it's again, to the same kind of example
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:26.720]   as a grant, it tends to be lower than what you would be able to get if you invest your assets
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:33.440]   in the market. Right now, it's 2.2%. And I'm willing to bet that the markets are a little
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:38.400]   bit choppy now, but in a long time horizon, most of us would hope to achieve a better than 2.2%
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.760]   return in the market. So you're able to write off your high tax income now,
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:49.520]   reinvest that money in the market, and give those charitable donations in the future.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:55.680]   And any appreciation above what is donated to charity, you're able to at the end of the trust,
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.960]   so in 20 years in this situation, keep that money for yourself, or have that money returned back to
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:07.600]   yourself or future generations. So it's a great opportunity for folks that you can write off high
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:14.960]   tax income now, reinvest that money, and then give to charity later in the future. And if people are
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:22.320]   just also charitably inclined, it's a really good way to set aside money to go to a charity in the
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:29.200]   future. Very comparable to a donor advice fund, except it also has some tax planning and estate
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:34.720]   planning benefits if those matter to you as well. But it also just guarantees that, hey, this cause
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:39.760]   that you care about, you're going to set them up to receive X amount of money for how many ever
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:46.400]   years you set up the trust. So it has a lot of purposes, but it's really underutilized for folks
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:52.320]   who have a big bonus or a high tax year. I know the assumed interest rate affects
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:56.400]   everything and the government's interest rate changes. But if you take an example of a million
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:01.840]   dollars, you get that full write off, you put a million dollars in a charitable lead annuity trust,
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:06.960]   you're going to end up donating probably at least a million dollars to charity.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:12.080]   But because of the arbitrage, do you end up getting back a million dollars?
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:18.320]   What ends up coming back, kind of ballpark it over 20 years or whatever is the easiest example?
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:23.520]   Yeah. I mean, the easiest way to think about this is the longer you set this structure up for,
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:28.960]   and the faster your assets grow, the higher the rate. So if you set this up for 25 years and your
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:35.440]   assets are growing at 10% a year, you may get a 50% return on your capital than if you had done
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:41.840]   nothing at all. So it may be an additional $500,000 in absolute cash that you're going to get on top
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:45.520]   of that kind of whatever that million is going to compound to.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:51.520]   In a circumstance like this, I would give away a million dollars into a charitable lead annuity
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:56.800]   trust. There would be donations made over the years and I'd get the remainder. Had I not done
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:02.400]   that, I would have paid taxes. And I probably, if you're in the highest brackets in California,
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:07.200]   I might have paid half a million dollars in taxes and I'm left with half a million to invest.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:12.720]   Would I have been better off ever? If I don't factor in the charitable donation,
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:18.640]   do I actually ever end up being better off over a period of time? If we assume a higher interest
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.560]   rate, like you said, 8%, 10%? Yeah. I mean, this is where you can
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:27.760]   generate an additional half a million dollars. And this is the whole point. Take your situation
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:31.920]   that you brought up. If you're in a high tax rate place like California, you earned a million
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:38.400]   dollars. You may pay literally half of it or more, the government. So you only have $500,000 to invest
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.680]   versus if you're able to avoid taxes on that million dollars. If you have $500,000 in the
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:50.240]   market versus a million dollars being reinvested in the market, that million dollars is going to
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:56.400]   create a lot more compounding wealth. That million dollars, you're going to give some of that to
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:02.080]   charity every single year. But just that million dollars compounding at 8% or whatever our assumed
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.560]   growth rate is here, it's going to over a long period, over 20 plus years, 25 years, it's going
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:11.280]   to create a lot more wealth. For 25 years, taking a base case, you'll probably create an additional
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.240]   half a million dollars of wealth for yourself after taxes.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:20.080]   Not factoring in the fact that you're generating probably at least that or more in charitable
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.360]   contribution. Yeah. So it's really like you're
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.880]   creating an additional half a million dollars of wealth for yourself, plus you're creating
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:32.720]   probably $1.2-$1.3 million in charitable causes to help advance things that you personally care
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:37.360]   about. So you're doing good in the world, you're creating wealth for yourself. It's a really
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:41.520]   powerful combination. And I don't know why, but for some reason, it seems like every time I talk
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:47.200]   to someone from New York, they all seem really excited about islets, which I know are related
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:53.200]   to life insurance. Is it as awesome? Is there a reason why it's so great in New York? What's
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:59.280]   the... I don't understand, as I read them, why they are as cool as some people make them sound.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:08.640]   Yeah. So insurance is its own interesting niche, but a world where there's a lot of tax
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.920]   opportunities. Now, a big advantage of islets, the core thing is it tends to be more of an
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:19.680]   estate planning structure. The big advantage is you can buy... Essentially, an islet stands for
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:25.360]   irrevocable life insurance trust. And what you're really doing is you're buying life insurance,
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:30.320]   you're putting it into this irrevocable trust. And so you're really gifting the benefits of life
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:36.880]   insurance. So i.e. the payout when you pass away to your kids or spouse or whoever it is.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:43.280]   The big benefit is hopefully when you buy your life insurance, your risk of dying is pretty low.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.920]   So your life insurance is valued at a pretty low rate. So let's say it's worth $100,000 now.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:54.640]   It's worth $100,000, you put it in this irrevocable trust. Over time, you will continue contributing
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:00.480]   the premiums towards the life insurance and that money in the life insurance is being reinvested
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:04.240]   in the market or it's increasing the value of the policy as you naturally get older.
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:11.120]   And let's just say when you pass away, it's worth $5 million. That $5 million doesn't count towards
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:16.720]   your state gift limit. Because you contributed the asset when it was worth $100,000, it only
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:22.560]   counts if you give a $100,000 gift to your kids or your future generations, even though when you
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:29.600]   pass away, it may be worth $5 million. That's the key benefit is you're able to essentially lock in
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:36.000]   a low gift value and allow it to appreciate over time. Now, why is it so big in New York? I don't
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.640]   know. There's also a big thing to kind of probably watch out with life insurance is there's a lot of
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:44.640]   people who take a lot of cuts of the pie when they're selling it to you. And it tends to be
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:51.360]   really lucrative for brokers, agents, advisors. So people do love to sell life insurance because
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.600]   they know they're locking you in for a really long time horizon. And so there's a lot of
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:01.840]   commission that gets spread out. I don't know if that impacts New York, but it is definitely a
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:08.720]   powerful tool. But I don't know if it's quite as important for folks who aren't worried about the
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:14.400]   estate tax to start with. Yeah, my advice for life insurance has always been that term life is like
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:19.680]   the thing that makes sense for almost everyone. And unless you're working with an accountant and
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:24.720]   an estate planning attorney that together decide that there's some more complex way to take
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:31.040]   advantage of whole universal etc. life set in a trust or even... And we won't go into it now.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:36.880]   But private placement, life insurance, these other things. One, stick to term life. And two,
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:43.280]   almost all the other strategies are not really as beneficial unless you're kind of at approaching or
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:50.000]   over that 24 million estate tax limit. Yeah. Yeah. And that's... I mean, this is like 100%
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.880]   agree with that. I think in most cases, people a lot of times overthink this or they get sold to.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:59.600]   Most cases, people should just do kind of the standard, right? Like this term life insurance,
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.800]   you know what it is, you know what you're getting, you're not being sold to and kind of being ripped
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:09.200]   off. And unless you have really particular needs, or a team that's getting each different answer,
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:15.920]   where it's like PPLI, etc, which makes sense in certain situations, it's better to keep it simple.
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:22.080]   I agree. I even had a listener send me an email and say, "Hey, I spent the last 10 years selling
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:26.800]   whole life. Please don't tell anyone on your show to buy it. I won't name who they are because I
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:31.680]   don't want to get them in trouble with their job. But even a guy who sells it said he wouldn't
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:37.600]   recommend it." So... And ultimately, what I understand is with this estate tax limit,
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:43.760]   all of the estate tax planning tactics are really just about trying to take a bigger amount of
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:50.160]   money and fit it into a smaller amount now so that you can donate it when it's less and counts less
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:55.760]   towards your limit. Another one that I know I found, which is outside of the kind of trust world,
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:02.480]   so I'll do my best to explain it, is around setting up a partnership or an LLC for your family.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:09.120]   And the way I understood it was, you create this LLC, you put assets in it, or a partnership,
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:17.680]   and you give the value of that business goes to your heirs, but the control of the asset stays
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:22.960]   with you. And so the IRS will give you this benefit of saying, "Oh, well, if you're giving
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:29.360]   your children a business that has $50 million, but you control all of it, and they don't get
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:33.280]   to choose what happens, well, you could lose it all. You could make terrible investments.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:37.120]   So we're going to give a huge discount." And I don't know what that discount is. Let's call it...
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:43.600]   I think it's closer to like 80%. So now you're able to say, "Oh, I'm giving my kids a $10 million
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:49.920]   business instead of a $50 million business." And then when you pass away, well, the control is
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:55.040]   transferred. And so my understanding is that all these estate planning tactics are like,
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.480]   "How do you find a way to give large sums of money, either now or in the future,
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:04.400]   today, when you can price them or value them at a lot less?"
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:08.080]   Yeah. And there's really kind of... That nailed it on the head. And there's kind of three
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:12.640]   descriptions people often call this. They call it of like, "How do you freeze? How do you gift
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.280]   values?" And it's called the freeze. You freeze it at its current value when you expect it to
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:21.600]   appreciate it in the future. So you gift... Let's just say you have startup equity or something you
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:27.200]   expect to appreciate significantly. You gift it at the value, at the low value today. And then when
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:32.720]   it appreciates in the future, it's already in the ownership of a trust or your kids. And that future
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:37.600]   value doesn't count as your gift value. So that's the freeze. There's also a term called the burn,
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:42.080]   where it's how do you... Whether it's you paying taxes, this is where grats come into play.
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:48.160]   So in a grat, even though the assets, some of the money is coming back to you, all the
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:54.880]   appreciation passes on to your kids, you are liable for the taxes that are paid on assets,
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.120]   income realized in the trust. And the big advantage of this is you're literally... By
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:03.760]   paying the taxes personally, you're reducing the value of your estate. So in other words,
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.320]   you're burning down your estate. And then kind of the third category is discounting. And this
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:13.440]   is where it's whether it's control with kind of these family partnerships of... You can do all
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:18.480]   sorts of... Structure these things in all sorts of different ways, whether it's control, or it's
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:26.400]   hard to value asset, or you reduce the intangibles. How do you reduce the value below what you probably
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.640]   think it's worth or what you can actually realize in the market? There's kind of a famous example
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:39.280]   where Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, took Nike shares, put it in an LLC, and then he gifted parts
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:45.040]   of it over time to his son. And each time he gave it to his son, it was at a discount because it was
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:50.320]   a non-controlling interest. And so he's able to take something like a 15 or a little bit higher
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.440]   discount on those assets, even though Nike shares are very liquid. We can sell them at any time in
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:00.960]   the market, but because it was part of this structure, they're able to discount it. And so
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:06.160]   as a result, from an IRS standpoint, he was giving less value, which means there is less taxable
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:13.600]   gifting that he had to pay to the government. Yeah, I'm holding this document up here that I
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:18.720]   got from Morgan Stanley at a conference... Not a conference, like a talk once.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.720]   And it's like, "Here are the better outcomes of using all these strategies." And in this case,
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:28.240]   it's a crazy one that I'll just run through. Not the numbers, but it said, "If you just set up a
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:35.520]   basic revocable trust and you transfer money, and you have exactly $45 million, by the time your
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:42.480]   children get the money 30 years later, you're going to have $281 million, but you'll pay $112
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:48.080]   million in taxes, and they'll only get $190 million." And they're like, "But if you go
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:53.440]   through..." And in this example, they set up a family limited partnership, a GRAT, and a revocable
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:27:00.160]   trust, and then two defective irrevocable trusts. So it's the most complex, insane example that...
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:04.960]   By the way, if you have $45 or $50 million, you're probably working with someone to do stuff like
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:10.960]   this. But at the end of the day, it says, "Your net estate post-tax with this example was $500
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:17.520]   million versus the $198 million that you would have paid in the previous example, netting you
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:23.200]   an extra $300 million." So these are just... We talked about some of these strategies.
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.600]   And while they might not practically be relevant for most people listening,
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:34.480]   it's pretty crazy to dig into the way they work for certain people and how they're able to unlock
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:39.840]   in this case, hundreds of millions of dollars of value. There's one more thing that you guys do
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:47.440]   around stretch IRAs that I think might actually benefit people who are in circumstances like this.
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:50.400]   Correct me if I'm wrong. Do you want to talk a little bit about that?
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:55.840]   Yeah. And just before I get into that, to your point, it's kind of crazy. There's a lot of
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.400]   these things like the Black Arts, where people you hear about these trusts, and for most people,
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:05.200]   they don't mean much, but the returns are pretty incredible. In that situation, it's an additional
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:12.960]   $300 million on $200 million of assets. And these things, whether you have $50 million or a couple
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.600]   of $100,000, there's a lot of these opportunities. Now, the big challenge for most people is...
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:24.960]   Kind of a sad fact is the US tax code for the last 50 years has grown by 150,000 words a year.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:29.440]   What that practically means for you, your audience, they're smart, they're trying to learn
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:34.720]   these things. There's just no way you can keep up. And so what this means is unless you have that team
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:38.880]   of lawyers and accountants, you're going to miss out on these opportunities and you're going to
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:45.200]   significantly fall behind. And that's kind of... I mean, not to get too biased, that's the problem
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.880]   we're trying to solve is how do we use technology to help people find and take advantage of these
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:54.160]   opportunities? Because otherwise, the tax code is not built for someone who doesn't have high
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.200]   nine figures. It's funny, you mentioned someone who has $50 million. Most of the situations we
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:03.760]   see in this world is there's folks with that, they don't actually have access to good folks in this,
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:07.920]   because it's one of the hardest things to get access to is high quality folks who can help you
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.880]   with this tax and estate planning. Because guess what? All the family offices with billionaires,
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:18.000]   they tend to snap up the best folks in those spaces because it's just so valuable. You're
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.360]   talking about those results that you're seeing there, that's hundreds of percent of additional
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:26.400]   value for your children. If you're a billionaire, what price aren't you going to pay? And there's
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:32.240]   no way that me or you or your audience can compete on a per hour basis or salary to hire that best
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:37.200]   person that that billionaire wants. And so that's kind of... It just creates this huge
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.760]   challenge for folks to take advantage of this stuff, despite how meaningful it is.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:51.600]   But jumping to the stretch IRA piece, this is probably one of the most applicable things for
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:58.800]   most people of tax planning opportunities. For context, most Americans, when they're building
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:05.120]   wealth for their retirement and their financial safety net, they use either a standard IRA or a
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:10.800]   Roth IRA. These are trusts, they're actually irrevocable trusts that the government has
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:16.720]   specifically created and outlined benefits for to help people better save assets for their retirement.
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:23.280]   And with a standard IRA, it allows you to contribute pre-tax money and it allows the
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:28.800]   assets to grow in an IRA on a tax-free basis until you start taking withdrawals after you're 59 and
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:36.560]   a half. Now, historically, when people pass away and they have an IRA with money, they would do
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:43.120]   what's called over a stretch IRA or a rollover IRA, where let's say it was my parents. Their IRA would
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:48.480]   roll into my IRA. And so it would stay on a pre-tax basis, and it would keep growing and
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:54.560]   compounding. And I would wait until I'm 59 and a half to start taking distributions and paying
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:31:02.320]   taxes. Now, in 2020, there was a law called the Secure Act passed, which essentially stopped
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:07.520]   people from being able to roll over their IRA between generations. So now instead of my parents'
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:13.680]   IRA being able to roll over into my IRA, I have to keep it in their account and I can keep it in
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:19.040]   their IRA for a max of 10 years. And then when I do withdraw it, I have to pay ordinary income tax
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:24.400]   rates on all the withdrawals. So if you're in California, New York, you may be paying 50% to
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:33.920]   55% of those assets. The solution that's come about since the Secure Act was passed in 2020
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:40.640]   is people taking their parents' IRA, being willed and rolled over into a charitable remainder trust.
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:46.240]   And the big benefit of this is when it passes the charitable remainder trust,
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:51.440]   it can remain in there for more than 10 years and keep compounding on a pre-tax basis.
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:56.640]   So you get a lot of the benefits of the stretch IRA, where instead of rolling over from my parents'
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:02.880]   IRA to my IRA, it is rolling over from my parents' IRA to my charitable remainder trust,
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:06.960]   but can keep growing on a pre-tax basis and isn't constrained to 10 years.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:14.400]   And once it's in the charitable remainder trust, the appreciation after that rollover
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:18.160]   isn't taxed at ordinary income rates. So that appreciation isn't going to be taxed at 50%.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:23.360]   If you're in California, it'll be taxed at 35% long-term capital gains.
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:28.960]   So you get more pre-tax growth, as well as you can pay lower tax rates on the withdrawals.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:35.920]   So we see a lot of folks who are, parents are getting elderly and they're planning for how do
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:40.160]   they pass on these assets, particularly a lot of financial advisors who are trying to help their
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:47.200]   clients for intergenerational planning, really roll this out to their clientele for them to help
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:51.680]   create more wealth in the family, preserve that. And it's also right now, it's because it's
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:58.000]   Secure Act was just passed in 2020, most folks aren't aware of the best way to deal with it.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.800]   Because again, unfortunately, the tax code isn't accessible. And so you've got a lot of folks where
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:07.600]   they have money or they've earned, they've contributed money to their life, but it's
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:13.920]   really hard to figure out what do I do? And even though it is meaningful, it's a tough challenge.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:18.000]   I mean, you said some of the tax code is not accessible, but on top of that,
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.840]   a long time ago, before I think the kind of myths of the kind of tax avoidance trust to
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:28.560]   avoid state taxes, which we won't get into now, because I think it kind of came out that a lot
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:34.800]   of states outlawed them. I was looking into this and I realized, "Oh, wow." One of the reasons that
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:40.560]   this isn't easy for people to do is that the cost to administer these trusts and to set up the trust
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:45.600]   were so high that I spent all this time talking to someone and found out, "Wow, this is a great way
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:50.560]   to maybe avoid high California taxes," only to find out they were like, "Well, it's going to
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:56.080]   cost us $25,000 to set up a trust, and you're going to pay 1.5% a year for someone to manage
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:59.680]   and administer it and do the investments." And I was immediately like, "Well, you should have said
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.760]   that upfront because we're not talking about... I didn't have enough money for that to make
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:11.280]   any difference." But can you tell us a little bit before we wrap about how you guys are trying to
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:16.720]   make this a little bit more accessible and affordable, especially for people that might
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.760]   benefit from the charitable remainder, the charitable lead trust, which aren't necessarily
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:28.000]   tools for people with $24+ million? Funny enough, the situation you talked about,
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.760]   that was the reason I started the company, was I went through that exact situation.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:37.200]   And when I saw lawyers' costs and accountants' costs, it's what actually made it the ROI negative
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:42.160]   for me to set it up. And going through that process, you realize there's a better way to do
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.600]   it. And so the idea behind Valor is we've automated a lot of this setup and administration for these
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:52.560]   charitable remainder trusts, charitable lead trusts, and graphs so that there are no legal
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:57.840]   fees upfront. So instead of paying that lawyer $25,000, you're avoiding that. And then also the
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:04.160]   kind of annual fees to administer these trusts, we've dropped those. Compared to that situation,
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:08.160]   we're less than a sixth of their cost. Compared to most of the other folks we see in the market,
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:13.120]   we're less than half the cost. And the whole idea is by dropping these costs, we can make the ROI
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:19.120]   worthwhile for more folks and help them build more wealth. And we've kind of obviously both
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:24.240]   been building companies in this space. The whole premise of fintech is that you can create more
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.120]   value. You can use technology to enable others to build wealth more efficiently and open up
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:33.440]   opportunities. And that's kind of what we're doing here is how do you take these kind of black box of
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:38.400]   irrevocable trust and wealth building structures that historically have only been available to
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:44.720]   those with nine figures and help everyone build wealth. Yeah, it's fantastic. The blog posts you
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:48.960]   guys have written on the Valor site are great. They go into more detail than most companies do.
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:55.440]   I'm going to link to a handful of them in the show notes so that people can go check them out.
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:59.680]   If they have any questions or want to reach out to you guys, where should people find you?
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:07.920]   Valor.io, V-A-L-U-R.io. Always happy to chat with folks there to answer more questions. We have,
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:12.960]   as you mentioned, a lot of content. We take calls with folks to help walk them through
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:16.720]   and understand these structures as well. So that's the best place to reach us.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.520]   Awesome. Thank you so much for being here.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:32.720]   Really appreciate it, Chris. We appreciate your time and love your podcast.
