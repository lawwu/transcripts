[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   Why can't we love pleasure and love God at the same time?
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.760]   Paul seems to assume that we can't, and it's a text that confuses a podcast listener
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.240]   named Gabriel, who writes in to ask this.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.260]   Hello, Pastor John, and thank you for Ask Pastor John.
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.780]   My question is about that phrase in 2 Timothy 3:4, "lovers of pleasure rather than lovers
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.160]   of God."
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.840]   Has this established a dichotomy between seeking pleasure and seeking God?
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.700]   If so, why is it impossible to do both?
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.100]   Why can't we love pleasure and love God at the same time?
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.680]   Pastor John, what would you say to Gabriel?
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.000]   It is about time that we get this question.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.020]   I mean, we are Christian hedonists, and there's a text just crying out for attention.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.080]   So let's put the text in front of us.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.900]   Here's what he says, 2 Timothy 3, 1-5, "In the last days there will come times of difficulty.
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.900]   For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.700]   to parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control,
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.060]   brutal, not loving, good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit," and here it comes,
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.580]   "lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having the appearance of godliness but
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.380]   denying the power."
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.580]   Avoid such people.
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.580]   Now Gabriel is certainly right to flag this text as something that needs special attention,
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.900]   especially from a Christian hedonist like me.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.660]   Lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:52.780]   Is this then not an indictment of Christian hedonism, which says we should pursue our
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.860]   fullest and lasting pleasure in God no matter what it costs?
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.820]   That's what I believe and have devoted my life to arguing for and trying to live.
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.340]   Gabriel wants to know, can't we pursue pleasure and God?
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.140]   Can't we love pleasure and God at the same time, which Paul seems to say, "No, you can't."
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:24.860]   So what we have to do with a text like this is not turn away from the text and start making
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.300]   up our own views about pleasure and about God, but stay with the text and let Paul tell
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:40.700]   us how he's using his words, namely the word "pleasure" and the word "God" in particular.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:49.540]   Paul is clearly treating them as competitors for our affections, for our love.
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.340]   Loving pleasure rather than loving God.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:01.740]   He's treating God as an object of our love, and he's treating pleasure as an object of
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.740]   our love.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.420]   And when you think of them that way, pleasure is clearly being perceived as an idol, an
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.540]   alternative to loving God.
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.140]   That's the way Paul is setting it up.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.140]   Paul is not asking the question whether, looked at another way, God might be our pleasure.
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.380]   He's not asking that.
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.460]   He's not talking about that.
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:34.500]   If God is our pleasure, then pleasure can't be in competition with God, but pleasure is
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.660]   virtually the same as our love for God.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:48.580]   So Paul is using the word "pleasure" as an object of delight, not an act of delight.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.580]   Mark that.
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.420]   That's so important to get our categories clear.
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.700]   He's treating the word "pleasure."
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.900]   He's treating the reality of pleasure as an object of our delighting, not the act of our
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.900]   delighting.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:09.540]   If pleasure is an object of delight, something we delight in, then it competes with God,
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.820]   and we have to choose God above pleasure.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:20.500]   But if pleasure is viewed not as the object of delight, but the act of delighting, then
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.700]   God can be the object of that delighting.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.420]   He can be our delight, be our pleasure.
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.560]   And in that sense, pleasure and God would not be in competition at all.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.860]   But that's not the way Paul is thinking here.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:45.980]   Paul is thinking here of pleasure as a physical or psychological sensation that we crave more
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.360]   than we crave God.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.420]   And in this sense, pleasure has to become an idol, and we must choose between pleasure
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.740]   and God.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.820]   So let me tell two stories that illustrate what I think Paul is getting at.
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:09.540]   I remember—here's the first story—I remember over 20 years ago interviewing Sam Crabtree
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.820]   as an executive pastor candidate for Bethlehem.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.300]   He's been at Bethlehem ever since.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:25.100]   In the interview, he said something that made me love and admire him and his insight.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.100]   We hired him.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.100]   I love Sam.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.600]   He's still wise.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:38.220]   He said that he worries about some churches which in their worship services seem to be
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.060]   "loving, loving God more than loving God."
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.500]   Let me say it again, because it struck me—that's why I remembered all these years later—he
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:57.860]   was concerned that in some worship services people seem to be "loving, loving God more
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.460]   than loving God."
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:07.060]   So a person might say he's taking pleasure in God in worship, and that would be good,
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:14.940]   but he might slip over into taking more pleasure in the pleasure of taking pleasure in God
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.380]   than in really taking pleasure in God.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.260]   And we all know this danger, right?
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.140]   We can slip into loving the emotional music, or slip into the emotional fellowship, or
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:31.100]   slip into the various physical and psychological sensations that attend a focus with God, while
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.620]   God himself slowly disappears.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:42.540]   The beauty of his character and the beauty of his ways just drop out of our consciousness.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:49.220]   That would be a religious form of the kind of thing Paul is concerned about here—loving
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.180]   pleasure rather than loving God.
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.140]   Now, here's the second story.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.100]   It's an even more pointed illustration, I think.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.740]   Soon after Noelle and I were married, I read a book about sex in marriage, and it made
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.420]   this amazing statement that I had not thought of before, but ever since have considered
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.140]   it just stock, beautiful, glorious, obvious wisdom.
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:26.820]   It said, "One kiss after sexual climax is worth a thousand kisses before sexual climax."
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.820]   Whoa!
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.420]   Now, why would that be?
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:36.820]   It's because all the kisses of foreplay are ambiguous.
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:46.980]   They might be owing to strong affections for your spouse as a cherished person, or you
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:55.000]   might have gotten so caught up in the love of pleasure, the sensations, that the kisses
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.060]   have no connection with the preciousness of the person and are only expressions of sexual
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.300]   abandon and sexual sensation.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:14.460]   But after sexual climax, when there are no overpowering physical sensations carrying
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:25.800]   you, but only the preciousness of the relationship, then a tender, eye-to-eye, heartfelt kiss
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:33.880]   says, "You are more precious to me than all those sensations.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.600]   And if I had to choose, I would choose you.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   You.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.220]   You, Noelle.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:48.280]   Not mainly the sexual sensations that you give me, but you are my cherished treasure."
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:54.680]   Now, that is, I think, what Paul is getting at in relation to God.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:02.000]   Remember, it says—this is amazing—it says in verse 5 of 2 Timothy 3 that these people
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.700]   have an appearance of godliness while they are loving pleasure more than loving God.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:17.120]   But in fact, they are being sustained not by the power of godliness, not by the power
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.960]   of the beauty of God's person and the preciousness of his fellowship; they're being sustained
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.680]   by the secondary pleasures of being part of the Christian community.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:36.720]   So the answer to Gabriel's question is, you can't love pleasure and love God when
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:46.360]   pleasure is conceived as an alternative object of your affections luring you away from a
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.800]   superior delight in God.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:10:00.040]   But you can pursue pleasure and pursue God at the same time if God himself is your pleasure.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.080]   Amen.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.600]   That is a good, clarifying word on this text.

[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   life?
