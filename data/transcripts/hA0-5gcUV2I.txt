[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   We're continuing to talk about Billy Graham and your memories of him, Pastor John.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.380]   And the Piper family history is tied up with one particular controversy surrounding Billy
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.480]   Graham.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.800]   And listeners may not know about this.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.760]   So can you explain for us a little of what happened between Billy Graham and Bob Jones,
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.480]   and how did that controversy between them impact your father?
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.800]   In Greenville, South Carolina, where I grew up, there's a university across the highway
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.400]   from where I live called Bob Jones University.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   It's big.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.640]   I don't know, four or five thousand students, maybe.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.800]   I haven't checked more recently.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.840]   A very strong and very influential fundamentalist institution.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.920]   That's a word that they love and would use.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.960]   My dad was happy to call himself a fundamentalist.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.500]   Lots of people would call me a fundamentalist.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.120]   What a fundamentalist is historically is not only someone who embraces all the fundamentals
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:14.000]   of the faith, but has a doctrine of separation and defense of the faith that is fairly militant.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.840]   George Dollar wrote a history of fundamentalism one time called "The History of Fundamentalism,"
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.080]   and the cover of the book was a Bible with a fist on it.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.440]   And the subtitle was "A Militant Defense of the Historic Faith," or something like that.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.280]   And so that sense of being willing to fight, go to the mat, separate from people who are
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.760]   not truly faithful, that marked historic fundamentalism.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.000]   And to this day, it does.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.920]   And frankly, I have a high level of respect for that approach towards Christianity, and
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.140]   would only differ from it probably in some degrees of how we deal with culture and how
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.840]   we handle certain disagreements.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.720]   So yes, my father went to school there, was one of those, loved that school, cherished
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.560]   what he got from it.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:15.360]   And in 1957, a dispute between Billy Graham and his crusade strategies and methods, and
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.520]   the fundamentalists on the other side, who thought he was compromising the gospel by
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.280]   the way he was supported by liberal people in his crusades.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.480]   That controversy came to a head, and my father, who was on the board of Bob Jones, had to
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.880]   make a choice of whether he would remain on the board and side with those who were saying
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:47.200]   Billy Graham's crusades were sub-Christian or of the devil even some, or whether he would
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.160]   stay with the school he loved.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.420]   He felt like he needed to resign, and he did.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.920]   And so all the rest of my growing up life, I was 11 then, all the rest of my life then
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.960]   was under the shadow of that disagreement.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:10.920]   And it broke my dad's heart, and to my great gladness, there was a sweet reconciliation
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.200]   between him and some of the leaders at Bob Jones in his 80s.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:24.040]   And my dad died in a nursing home owned by Bob Jones University.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.760]   So symbolically, he came full circle.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.240]   The issue came to a head in 1957 because of the New York crusade.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.160]   The New York crusade was historic, it was phenomenal.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.760]   Billy Graham went there, I'm not sure how long he was planning to be there, but he wound
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.600]   up preaching every night for 16 weeks in New York.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.400]   That's an unprecedented evangelist.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.040]   That's four months in Madison Square Garden.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.560]   Jesus Christ is being lifted up to a full house.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.360]   The problem is, Billy wanted as many people to say yes and support him as would be willing,
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.600]   and there were people who supported him and even sat on the platform who were clearly
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.920]   liberal, didn't believe the doctrines he believed, and that was felt to be a profound contradiction
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.160]   of faithfulness to the gospel by some.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.360]   And Billy always said that he'd go anywhere and preach under any circumstances if he was
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.560]   allowed to say what he wanted to say.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:42.640]   So I have really sad memories about that disruption between my father and the school and fundamentalism
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.800]   in general over that issue.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.640]   But I'm really happy with the decision that my father made.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.200]   I think he made the right decision.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.880]   In other words, I think it's possible to disapprove.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.800]   My father did disapprove with Bob Jones of some of Billy Graham's strategies.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.680]   He said to them in correspondence that I've read that he said, "I agree that I would not
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.240]   do it this way, but I can't say that Billy Graham's crusades are of the devil.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.920]   I can't write off the work of God.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.080]   I can't say that God's not moving here.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.400]   I can't withdraw my support from Billy's gospel efforts for these disagreements."
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.480]   Yeah, so how influential was this episode in your life, this conflict between Billy
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.680]   Graham and Bob Jones and your father's hard decision?
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.160]   How influential was this in how you personally think through which conferences you will speak
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.160]   at now?
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.840]   You know, I don't know the answer to that, Tony.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.280]   I don't know the causality of a lot of the convictions that I have, but I think it would
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.160]   be honoring to my father and probably faithful to history to say that what we experienced
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.080]   growing up has really significant, almost subconscious effects that may show themselves
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.040]   30 years later.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.560]   So that I find myself today being very much at home with my father's preaching.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:12.000]   In fact, I was listening to my father preach just two days ago.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.120]   My wife and I were on our anniversary.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.680]   We did not go to church.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.560]   We were way up in the mountains at bed and breakfast, and we said, "Let's have our own
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.040]   little church here."
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.320]   And we couldn't get internet, so I couldn't listen to my living favorite preachers.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.440]   So I listened to one of my dead favorite preachers, namely my dad, because I have a whole bunch
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.800]   of his sermons on my computer.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.600]   And as I was listening to him, I said, "I love this guy.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.680]   I love what he preaches."
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:47.080]   And so I don't doubt that his approach to this was influential on me and that I can
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.680]   go into a conference, and I might say, "I don't like this music," or, "I don't like
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.720]   some of the slapstick that's happening on the platform.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.440]   I don't like all the things that the other speakers are saying."
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.120]   But they're going to let me talk to a lot of people here about the supremacy of God
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.760]   in all things for the joy of all peoples through Jesus, and that's what I'm called to do.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:15.520]   And so probably my approach to be willing to lift up my vision of God in places where
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.880]   it might not be completely shared has been influenced by my father's choices.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.880]   Yes.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.560]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
