[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.520]   the chapter we read at the beginning, Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians, chapter
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:17.160]   four, beginning reading verse sixteen again. The sixteenth verse in the fourth chapter
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.040]   of Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians. "For which cause we faint not, but though
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:34.840]   our outward men perish, yet the inward men is renewed day by day." Now, I call your
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.840]   attention to this statement, coming here as it does in this magnificent chapter, in order
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.280]   that we may say one further thing about a theme that has been occupying us for the last
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.880]   two Sunday mornings, and that is the whole problem of how to live in this present evil
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:03.480]   world as Christian people ought to live. This is indeed, of course, a perennial problem,
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.480]   and one which we shall go on to consider, God willing, next Sunday, when we resume our
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.480]   studies in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, in chapter six.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.680]   But it did seem to me that before we left this particular way of looking at it, we should
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.600]   add this further word. I do so, of course, because of the days in which we live and the
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.120]   unusual sense of crisis which most people must have had during these past weeks. These
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.640]   are the things that test our profession of faith. Circumstances like this show very clearly
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.520]   whether we are truly in the faith or whether we have been deluding ourselves. And we have
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.400]   been reminding ourselves of certain things which are put before us in the New Testament,
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.320]   indeed, in the whole Bible, everywhere.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.360]   The first point we made was this, that there is nothing so important at such a time as
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.720]   to know and to realize that Jesus Christ, our Lord, is not ashamed to call us brethren,
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.160]   the full content of that. And then last Sunday we were looking at a parallel statement, "Wherefore,
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.200]   God is not ashamed to be called their God." There it is. There is nothing beyond that.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.720]   There is no greater privilege than that God is not ashamed to be called our God. And it
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.920]   can be taken individually, should be taken individually, personally, and in the singular.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:44.840]   Are we able to say, "My God," and know that God is indeed, verily, our God?
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.680]   Well now then, here we are looking this morning at the experience and the life of a man who
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:59.320]   was able to say that without any hesitation or doubt at all. The greatest thing he could
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.720]   say to the Philippians, as I was reminding you at the end last Sunday morning, was this,
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:14.200]   "My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus."
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.080]   The apostle is fond of using that expression. He talks about "my gospel." This thing
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.860]   was individual to him. Now here in these words that are before us this morning, and as you
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:34.200]   noticed in the whole chapter, the apostle deals with his own actual experience. And
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.280]   it seemed good to me that we should illustrate the principles which we have been laying down
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:50.440]   in this way and manner. Because here the apostle leads us right into the secret of his life
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.800]   of triumph and of victory. He describes his circumstances. He does so in considerable
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.960]   detail and in a most honest manner. He was in the midst of the most trying and cruel
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.880]   circumstances imaginable. Read again for yourselves the list of the troubles which he tells us
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.440]   were literally surrounding him at that very time when he was writing the letter. And yet
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.280]   you notice that in spite of that he is able to write in this way, summing it up in this
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.360]   sixteenth verse, "For which cause we faint not in spite of all that. But though our outward
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.600]   men perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day."
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.840]   Now as we look at this, let us remind ourselves that the apostle was really writing in the
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:48.160]   midst of these most cruel and adverse circumstances. So often I feel we miss the teaching of a
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.800]   statement such as this because we tend to idealize the whole situation. We tend to think
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.040]   of it as the fusion of a literary man sitting down in comfort in a study surrounded by his
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.880]   books and suddenly his imagination is inflamed and he writes things like this. Well that
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.400]   is a very false picture. The apostle was literally experiencing these things when he wrote. It
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.840]   is not a man sitting back and taking a kind of idyllic view of life. It is a man in the
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.080]   midst of all these untoward circumstances, literally telling us what his experience is.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.280]   And you notice the honest way in which he does so. He does not conceal anything at all.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.800]   He exposes himself and his feelings to us in order that we may know exactly how he was
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.360]   and how he felt. Well now this I say should be of great encouragement to us all. Whatever
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.280]   may be happening to any one of us, it is certain that we are not being called at the moment
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.200]   to experience anything in any way comparable to that which the apostle was experiencing
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.000]   when he wrote these words that are before us.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.720]   But here it is. Here is a pattern. Here is an example. If he was able to react like this
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   in his conditions and circumstances, how much more so then should we be able to triumph
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:23.100]   and prevail and know great joy in our lives surrounded as we are by difficulties and uncertainties
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.320]   and the trials of life in this world at this hour.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:34.800]   Well now let us see how he succeeded. He tells us fortunately. He lets us into the secret.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.440]   And there is nothing, I again assert, that is more important for us as Christian people
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.120]   at this present hour than just to understand this. The thing is urgently practical for
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.280]   this reason. I am thinking not only of our own peace and comfort. That is important,
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.880]   of course. If our faith does not help us when we are in trouble, well, what is the value
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.880]   of it? There is no value in a fair-weather kind of faith. The test of any belief is the
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:07.920]   way in which it stands up to trials and tribulations. So from our own standpoint it is tremendously
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   important.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:15.960]   But there is something much more important than that. And that is the condition of men
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:22.840]   and women outside the Church and who are not Christians. There is in some ways today an
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.320]   evangelistic opportunity such as has not been the case for many a long day. I mean by that
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:36.600]   a personal evangelistic opportunity, an opportunity for each one of us as individuals. In other
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.000]   words, we are in this world as it is at this moment, the same as everybody else. And everybody
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.600]   else is bewildered and does not know what to do nor where to turn.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.520]   Well now here comes our glorious opportunity of showing what a difference it makes to be
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:57.280]   a Christian. Whatever our circumstances, we can do so. We react to everything in a different
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.960]   way from everybody else. When we are taken ill, we are not like other people. When sorrow
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.080]   and bereavement visit us, we do not react like the ungodly. We are not without hope
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.480]   and we do not mourn as those who are without hope. Whatever it is that goes against us,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.400]   we should be able to face it in such a way as to give people the impression that we are
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.840]   here, that we have something that they have not got, and that it is because of this secret
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.440]   that we are able to live as we do, and that in turn will lead them to inquire as to the
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:35.840]   secret that we do possess. This is therefore a matter of great responsibility for us. The
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:44.000]   world, I believe, is looking at us more and more, scrutinizing us more and more carefully.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.440]   It is bankrupt. Everything it trusted to us is gone. And I believe that at last it
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.400]   is beginning to look at Christian people. Well, we all have this opportunity then, wherever
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:09:00.600]   we are situated, and it is for this most urgent reason that I am pressing this consideration
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600]   upon you.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:07.280]   Now then, let us proceed to see how the Apostle tells us he was enabled to react in the way
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.840]   that he did. It is all here in a sense, summed up in this one verse. The first thing we notice
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:22.200]   is this, that the Christian is a realist, that he always faces the facts. Though our
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:31.120]   outward men perish, he is facing it. He is looking at it straight in the eye. He is in
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.160]   no way trying to get away from it, or to run away from it.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.600]   Now, here is the most important point. The charge that is commonly brought against us
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:46.960]   as Christians is that we are escapists, and that we come to our services in order, as
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:53.840]   it were, to drug ourselves, to turn our backs upon life, enter into some kind of mystical,
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:01.200]   almost mythical, fairy-tale realm, and thus don't face the facts and the problems of
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   life.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.120]   Well, the only reply to that is that it is completely false. Of course, I am prepared
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   to admit that there are people who do use religion as a drug. There is no question about
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.720]   that. But I am not here to defend them, I am here to denounce them. They are the people
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.000]   who do the greatest harm to the Christian faith. That is not the Christian faith.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.120]   The claim we make for the Christian faith, as I say, is this, not only that it is realistic,
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.720]   but that it alone is realistic, and that there is nothing else in the world this morning
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:39.340]   that so invites people and encourages them to face facts as they are, as this gospel
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.940]   of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:48.160]   It is the world, of course, that is guilty of escapism. It doesn't know that, it doesn't
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:55.480]   realize that. But what is all its pleasure mania but a form of escapism? That is its
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:01.260]   way of running away from it. Whether it spends its time today in reading a whole series of
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.240]   Sunday newspapers or whatever they do, it is all escapism. They are getting away from
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.800]   it, minds being occupied by something else and all their various forms of pleasure and
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:17.540]   of entertainment. That is nothing but sheer escapism. And, of course, it is observable
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:23.680]   that as the crisis deepens, so the pleasure increases.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.880]   Because people just become desperate, I often have been reminded of what happened at the
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.640]   very beginning of the last war. Many of you probably remember it. The first few days of
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.080]   the war, all places of entertainment were shut. It was a part of the blackout regulations.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:47.880]   Cinemas, theatres, all such places were shut for a few days. But you remember what happened.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:53.680]   Immediately, there were loud and persistent protests from the masses of the people, urging
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.040]   the local authorities to open these places again. The reason they gave was this, that
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.800]   if these places were not opened, they would go mad. And, of course, the thing was perfectly
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.880]   true. It was quite right. It was a true psychological statement. They would have gone mad. Why?
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.120]   Well, because they could not take it. They could not stand it. They had to have some
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:18.080]   means of escape. And that was their normal, customary means of escape. And suddenly bereft
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.640]   of it, and left to themselves, they did not know what to do.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.240]   Well now, that is the world, and it is still the world. The world does not like to think
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.040]   of old age. The world does not like to think of death, and regards that as morbid. But
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.600]   you see, the apostle is not like that. He says, "Though our outward men perish."
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:41.760]   He says, "I know. This body of mine is decaying." He was not a very old man when he wrote this,
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:48.320]   but he was older than his years because he had worked so hard. He had preached so consistently,
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.840]   indefatigably. He had travelled and had suffered so much. He was an old man. He calls himself
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:58.160]   Paul the Aged, though actually in years he was not, I say, an old man. But here it is.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.560]   Now, he does not try to hide that from himself, and try to so handle himself, and to do things
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.160]   to himself to persuade himself that he is still very young and fit. Not at all. "Though
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.480]   our outward men perish," he is looking it straight in the face. He is not evading it.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.360]   He is not avoiding it. Now, this is, I say, a great characteristic
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:22.000]   of the teaching of the Bible everywhere. It is realism. The Bible holds us face to face
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.840]   with the facts. It is the Bible alone this morning that reminds us all that our life
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:34.080]   in this world is but a journey. We are but strangers and pilgrims. We are travellers,
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.840]   journeymen. This is but a temporary existence of ours. The Bible is always holding that
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.400]   right before us. And the world, of course, is shocked and says, "Oh, you miserable Christians,
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.680]   always looking at the fact of death." Well, by saying so, it admits that we are right
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:54.800]   when we say that the Bible and its teaching are alone realistic in an ultimate sense.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.280]   Very well, here is the first thing. If you are concerned to have just a little bit of
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.120]   comfort to make you forget your troubles, you are already outside the Christian way
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.440]   of thinking. Christianity does not gloss over things, does not just cover them over, that
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.320]   everything may be all right for the time being. No, no, it is too radical for that. It is
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:20.160]   too profound. So it invites us to look at things as they are, not to refuse to listen,
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.840]   but to face them, drag them out, put them in front of you, and look them squarely, though
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.280]   our outward men perish. That is the first point. But then let us notice this, that the
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:38.600]   Christian faces the facts in a very special way, and in a unique way, and in a way that
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:44.560]   he alone can do. Now, this is the point of differentiation. Because there are people
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:52.880]   who are not Christians who do face the facts. There are not many, the masses of people do
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:15:00.680]   not, but there are some men, given perhaps an unusual gift of intelligence, who do believe
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:06.280]   in facing the facts. They may be so constituted temperamentally that they do so. We grant
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:13.680]   that. But no, here is the point of differentiation. They do not do so in the way that the Christian
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:23.280]   does so. The Christian, you see, puts it like this, "For which cause? We faint not."
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.960]   The Christian does not faint. Now, this means, of course, that he is not conquered, he is
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:36.840]   not defeated, he is not cast down. He is not utterly demolished, as it were, by the things
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:42.040]   that happen to him. Now, the apostle, of course, has been making this point in these extraordinary
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.160]   contrasts that he has been giving us all the way through. He says, "We are troubled on
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.280]   every side." The Christian is not a cheery man who says, "Everything is all right."
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.640]   Not at all. He says, "We are troubled on every side." It is never a true Christianity,
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.560]   that which pretends that there are no problems and difficulties. That is psychology. It is
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:05.400]   not Christianity. But, you see, this is Christianity, that though we are troubled on every side,
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:12.480]   yet we are not distressed. We are perplexed. The apostle Paul was perplexed, you know.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.360]   Do not think that you are not a Christian if you find yourself in perplexity about certain
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.600]   things this morning, if you do not quite understand why certain things have happened to you. Do
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.280]   not feel that you are not a Christian because of that. The apostle says that he was perplexed.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:31.360]   Well, what is the difference? Oh, he says, "Not in despair." That is the difference.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.760]   Persecuted? Of course. The Christian does not live a charmed life. Again, I say that
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.280]   is psychology, which says that believe this and you will never have any troubles again.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.280]   Christianity has never said that. Persecuted? It tells you that you will be persecuted,
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:52.600]   yes, but not forsaken. Cast down? That is to say that at times he is almost overwhelmed
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   by the thing. But he says, "Not destroyed." That is it. He is not destroyed. Well, now
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.760]   here I say we have got the same thing again, that though these things are happening, he
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.440]   says, "We do not faint. We do not fall down. We do not go out as if we were. We do not
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:14.600]   become unconscious. We are not utterly defeated by the thing." But the question is, how does
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:20.960]   this happen? What is it that keeps him from fainting? And here again I say we must draw
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:29.440]   the most important distinction. It is not that he just resigns himself to his fate and
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.480]   to what is happening to him. No, there is that point of view, as you know. There is
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.160]   that kind of philosophy, which says, "What is the use of doing anything about it? It
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.120]   has happened to you, there you are. What is the use of crying over spilt milk? There is
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:46.280]   your past. What is the use of being worried in the present? All your worry does not change
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.400]   anything at all, and your going over it and keeping yourself awake all night is not going
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.920]   to make the slightest difference to anything at all. Therefore, do not be a fool. Do not
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.680]   do it." Now, that is a kind of resignation. Of course, it is better than fainting. There
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.400]   is something about it that one cannot but admire. There is an element of courage in
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:10.560]   it, and an element of understanding. There is a very strong element of common sense in
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:17.280]   it all. But that is not the Christian position. But there is that position that you resign
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:23.920]   yourself. Of course, it is ultimately an attitude of complete hopelessness. It is just a refusal
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:29.120]   to think at all, because you know that there is no point in thinking. It is an acknowledgement
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:35.440]   that facts are as they are, and the inevitability of it all. And saying very well, "What
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.800]   is to be, will be. It does not matter what I or anybody else may do about it, this is
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:45.200]   what it is going to be." Now, there are some people who keep themselves from fainting simply
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.760]   by thinking like that. And as far as it goes, I say it is all right, but it is not the Christian
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:57.800]   position. What is the Christian position? Well, it is all here in one word. "For which
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:05.400]   cause," he says, "we faint not." But "though," that is the word, the word "though."
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:11.760]   Now, the whole of Christianity is in a sense in that one word, "though." "But though
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.520]   our ultimate man perish." You see, there is already a note of defiance. There is already
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:23.000]   a note of victory. "Though this is true, nevertheless." "Though" is a word that
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.920]   never stops at itself. It points forward. It always suggests a contrast. And there,
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:35.280]   I say, is the whole essence of the Christian faith, "though that is true, nevertheless."
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:42.680]   Now, here, I say, is the thing that we have to grasp above everything else. The Christian
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:50.920]   does not stop merely at the recognition of the inevitable. He does recognize the inevitable.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.920]   He does not blink at facts. He does not try to conceal them. He does not try to change
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:00.440]   them or manipulate them. He does not try to do something to himself by just ignoring them.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:07.320]   No, no, he looks steadily at them, and then he looks through them. He looks beyond them.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:13.120]   He brings in this "though" of his. He throws his mind and all that is in him right
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:20.360]   above them and through them and beyond them to something that he alone knows beyond it.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.280]   In other words, the Christian has something more to say. And I like to think of it like
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:32.320]   this. This is the difference between the Christian and the non-Christian. The non-Christian,
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:39.840]   at his best, as I say, describes the facts, paints them as they are, looks at them as
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:46.280]   honestly and as squarely and in as manly a manner as he can. And having done so, says,
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:52.240]   "Well, there it is. I've got to get on with it. I can't do anything else. I can't
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.320]   change them. I've got to stick it. I've got to grin and bear it." These are his
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:01.920]   terms. And he thinks this is wonderful. You remember we had it during the war, "London
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:07.160]   can take it." This philosophy of courage and of endurance. I don't want to criticize
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.080]   it, but I do want to show that it isn't Christianity. That's my point. It's all
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:18.440]   right as far as it goes. But you see, having painted his picture, having looked at them,
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:24.160]   having described the situation, he says, "Well, there it is. And I'm not going
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.120]   to faint. I'm not going to whimper and cry and run away. I'm going to stand and
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.440]   go through with it." And there he stops. He's got nothing more to say. Of course
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.800]   he hasn't. You see, it's entirely negative. It's nothing but sheer resignation with
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.280]   nothing positive about it at all. He finishes. He's said all he's got to say.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:51.040]   What's the Christian? Well, the Christian, by definition, is the man who goes on. Indeed,
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.600]   in a sense, the Christian is a man who begins where everybody else ends. The Christian is
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:03.280]   a man who begins to speak when everybody else is silent. If you like, as a general principle,
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:10.840]   you can put it like this. Man's extremity is God's opportunity. Man's come to the
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:17.480]   end. It's the extreme. It's the limit. It's the end. Man's extremity is God's
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:24.000]   opportunity. He's just beginning. Where the world ends, heaven begins. Where man ends,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.800]   God begins. Yes, where the non-Christian ends, the Christian begins.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.200]   You see, here are the two men. They're both looking at the same scene, and they're
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:40.240]   both giving the same description of it. And the non-Christian says, "There it is."
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:46.320]   The Christian says, "Oh, this is true, in spite of the fact that this is true. Nevertheless,
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:53.360]   here it is. He makes a protest. He's lifting up his head. He hasn't finished. He's
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:58.720]   really only just beginning." Now then, my friends, here is the question
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:05.600]   that we have to ask ourselves this morning. Are we like this? Is there this "though"
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:12.600]   in your life? Is there this protest against sheer pessimism and despair and final hopelessness,
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:18.320]   whatever the circumstances, the whole international situation, and everything that may be happening
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:24.680]   to you as an individual? Are you protesting? Are you saying "though"? Are you saying
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   "nevertheless"? The Christian defies the worst. He's able, I say, to see through
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:38.920]   it, see beyond it. He is able to rejoice in spite of it, where he is at this very moment.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:46.400]   Now here, then, I say we are face to face with the real test of our whole position this
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:53.400]   morning. Can we and are we saying this "though" our outward men perish? Very well, now then,
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.720]   let's see what it is that enables him to use this word "though." That's all it comes
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.840]   to. You know, this is the profoundest truth in the world, and yet it's essentially simple,
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:14.400]   as all God's works are simple, as the flowers are ultimately very simple when you analyze
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.360]   them. God's truth is really very simple, and it's all here for us in this one verse.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:25.920]   What enables the Christian to say "though"? What enables him to say "nevertheless"? What
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:31.120]   enables the Christian to go on speaking when everybody else has become silent? Well, here's
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:38.120]   the answer. Though our outward men perish, yet the inner men, the inward men, is renewed
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:49.600]   day by day. Now then, look at him. You see, he gives us the answer, as it were, in the
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.440]   opening words. For which cause? Here's my reason, he says. This is the explanation.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.680]   For which cause? In other words, the Christian can always give a reason for being what he
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   is. But if you can't give a reason for it, you haven't got the right thing. There are
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:14.400]   some people, of course, who are born with a hopeful, sanguine, optimistic temperament
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.240]   and outlook. And you say to them, "Well, really, this is very remarkable that you should
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:24.440]   be reacting like this." And you say to them, "Well, now, tell me exactly what is it that
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.240]   enables you to react like this and to behave in this manner in these extraordinary circumstances?"
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:34.280]   And all this kind of person can say in reply is this, "Well, really, I don't know. I just
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.400]   find myself like this. I seem to be made like this. I don't know what it is, but this is
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.320]   just how I am." And of course, he's quite right. He hasn't got any reason. It's a pure
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.880]   accident that. It just depends whether you're born like that or born a pessimist. And you've
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:53.600]   got no control over that at all. We don't control our temperaments. We are born with
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.760]   our temperaments. We are born with ourselves as we are. And you'll never do anything about
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.720]   that. In other words, you can't change your temperament. But Christianity can enable you
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.000]   to triumph, whatever your temperament is. But nothing else can.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.640]   So you see, the Christian can give a reason for which cause. Here's my reason. Here's
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:18.160]   the reason why I can say, "Though, nevertheless." Well, what is it? Oh, well, it's all this
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:27.280]   question you see about these inward men. "Though our outward men perish, is dissolving, going
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.760]   into decay. I'm aware of it. My powers are failing. My breath is shorter. My life, I
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.760]   know. It's just the last bit of the least. That's all I've got. My outward men," says
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:46.200]   the apostle, "is perishing. Visibly. I am well aware of it. Every day I live." "But
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:56.800]   it's all right," he says, "because the inward man is renewed day by day."
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:04.800]   Now here is the whole secret of the Christian's position. This inward man. Oh, I must put
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:10.660]   it in the form of a question before I proceed. Have you got an inward man? That's the thing
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.800]   that tells us whether we are Christians, that you have an inward man. "But what do you
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.080]   mean by your inward men?" says somebody. Well, I'll start by putting it like this, then,
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.760]   that it's something that only a Christian has. Nobody else has the inward men. That's
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:28.320]   the whole tragedy of the man who's not a Christian. He doesn't know anything about the inward
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.160]   men. He's only got the outward men. Well, what does all this mean? Well, let's follow
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.400]   out the contrast. The inward men, of course, is, as the apostle shows us, the exact opposite
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:44.800]   of the outward men. What's the outward men? This outward man of ours that is perishing.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:50.680]   Well, you start by saying it means the body. It includes the body itself, our physical
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:57.360]   frame. That is a part of the outward men. We live in these bodies. They have been given
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:03.680]   to us in order that we might express ourselves through them. This is how a personality lives
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.000]   in this world and does all that he has to do. The body is the instrument through which
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.560]   he does all this. Well, there is a part, then, of this outward man that is decaying and that
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:20.680]   is dissolving. But it doesn't stop at that. The outward men include something beyond the
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:29.040]   mere physical aspect of living. It includes this. It includes the whole of our life as
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:36.520]   it is lived only in terms of the body and what the body can do. Now, I think that is
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:44.160]   the best definition of it. I say we express ourselves through these various instruments
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:51.140]   and faculties that are a part of our body. And man, by nature, lives entirely in terms
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:58.520]   of his body and what he can do with and through and in his body. What does that include? Well,
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:04.560]   it includes a great deal. It includes all our outward contacts with this world in which
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:12.500]   we live, the world and its way and its things. For instance, I appreciate the beauty of nature
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:20.120]   through my body. That is a part of my outward man. It is that in which, and by means of
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:25.960]   which I am enabled, I say, to make contact with the universe in which I find myself,
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:33.160]   my eyes, my perception, my critical ability, my power to assess, my power of appreciation.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:41.080]   All this is a part of my physical life. You see, the brain is involved, and various other
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:48.100]   faculties, various other impulses, instincts and things of that kind. That is all a part
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:54.960]   of this life of the outward man. It is a part of my life that I express, I say, and I appreciate
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:00.240]   and I enjoy through the powers of my body. It is all my contact with the world that is
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:08.040]   out around and about me, but it includes my contact also with other people. Have you ever
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:13.000]   thought of that? How do you communicate with one another? What is it that enables us to
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.960]   enjoy fellowship with one another, to enjoy one another's society? What is it that determines
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.800]   this? Well, when you track it right down, you will find that it is a part of this life
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:30.320]   of the outward man. You see, the part of us that is known by other people is the outward
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.960]   man. There is a phrase which says, "The heart knoweth its own secrets." Nobody else
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:42.120]   does. Our contacts with one another are all a part of this life lived in the body. That
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.360]   is the kind of life that there is. We express it, of course, in our talk and conversation,
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:52.880]   in our looks, in our reactions, in our interests, in our excitements, in our imagination. It
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:57.800]   has a thousand and one ways of expressing itself, but it is all a part of this outward
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:04.360]   man. Have you ever thought that society lives on that? That is its level. That is the plane
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:11.480]   in which it exists and goes on. Let me put it like this, then, to prove that what I am
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:18.680]   saying is right. Are you justified, sir, someone, in saying that all that is a part of this
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:23.080]   outward man? What about appreciation of great music? What about appreciation of great poetry
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:33.240]   or something like that? Well, this is my answer. What is the effect upon all that of physical
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:39.880]   and bodily illness? That is the way to test it. Are you able to do all that when your
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:45.240]   body begins to fail, when your mind begins to get tired, or perhaps when it begins to
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:50.080]   get a little bit atrophied, or when any part of you begins to get tired or weary or to
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.920]   atrophy? Don't you find that you are cut off immediately, to some extent, from all
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:00.160]   these things? You have got to be in a certain fit physical condition before you can enjoy
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   and appreciate these things. And if somebody came along when you were really ill and brought
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.920]   one of these things, you wouldn't want to hear it. You can't take it at that point.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.800]   You can't make any contact with it. Why? Well, you see, it is all a part of this outward
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:16.400]   man, and it is all dependent upon the condition of the body. It is dependent upon physical
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:21.600]   fitness. Now, the life of society is a life that is being lived entirely in that realm.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:29.200]   It is all in terms of this outward man. It needs health, it needs money, it needs certain
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.800]   conditions. And when those are suddenly cut off, the thing itself that you have been living
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:40.840]   for and living on is suddenly cut off from you. That is the life of the outward man.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.760]   So the apostle turns and says, "Though our outward men perish," he means his body and
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.400]   all that he is enabled to do through the body alone and as such. What is the inward man?
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:59.240]   Well, I say it is something essentially different. Here is the life of the soul and of the spirit.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:06.840]   Here is something apart from the body, something distinct from the body. This again may express
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:12.800]   itself at times and often does through the body, but it exists apart from it. It is an
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:21.940]   entity on its own. It is ourselves apart from everybody else and apart from everything else.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:29.940]   It is my soul and spirit making me what I am, apart from my body and all its contents.
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:36.320]   It is something that will go on when my body has dissolved. It is something which functions
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:44.360]   though my body may be decaying. What is this? Oh, this is that which links me to God, that
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   which links me to the realm of the spirit and the eternal and the unseen. The apostle
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.680]   talks about it in the next verses. He is talking about it everywhere. "Our light affliction,
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.560]   which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.040]   glory while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.960]   seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:12.960]   Here then is this inner man, if you like, this new man as the New Testament also calls
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:19.720]   it. It means that I am aware of the fact that the most important thing about me is not this
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:25.200]   social life of mine, not this life which I live entirely and only in the body, not these
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:30.720]   contexts which I have with people and affairs and things solely in terms of my physical
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:38.680]   powers and propensities and capacities, but something that is apart from it all, something
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:43.960]   that is outside it all, something that is deeper than it all, something which can be
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:48.760]   increasing while that is actually decreasing, and therefore proves that it is not dependent
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:54.880]   upon it. Now then, here I say is the most vital distinction of all. It is my knowledge
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:00.640]   of the fact that I am a living soul. It is my knowledge of the fact that I have a spirit
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:06.240]   within me that is immortal, that goes on. It is a knowledge that I am related to God
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:12.920]   and that I am in communion with God. It is my realization that this is the thing that
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:23.600]   really matters, that all else ultimately goes, but this goes on. Something indestructible,
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:28.920]   something which is quite independent, I say, of what may happen to me, what may happen
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:36.960]   to my body, what may happen round and about me in this world. Though our outward men perish,
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:44.920]   the inward man is renewed day by day. My dear friend, do you know about this inward man?
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.480]   When everything else is dissolving in your body and round and about you, do you talk
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:56.520]   to this inner man? Are you aware of his presence and of his existence? Is he there, as it were,
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.760]   speaking to you and reminding you of who you are and what you are and your destiny and
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:10.840]   your relationship to God, the inward man? Now let's put this as a simple test. Do
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:17.640]   you fall back on this inward man when everything else goes? Imagine yourself cut off from every
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:25.720]   external contact, from everything that comes through the outward man. No television, no
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:35.640]   wireless, no newspapers. Friends all busily engaged somewhere else, and you are left alone.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:42.000]   How do you get on? How do you spend your time? What do you do with yourself? That's the
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.880]   way to test whether you know about the inward man. Is there this inward man that you are
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:56.840]   aware of within you? Are you able, as it were, to speak to him, and does he speak to you?
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.840]   Is there that which says, "Well, all this disappearing doesn't make any difference
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:06.280]   to me. That's never been my real life. Of course, it's been here. God has given it.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:11.120]   We're meant to enjoy life in this world. We don't become monks or hermits or anchorites,
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:17.400]   but that's not my life. I've never lived on that. I could go on without it quite well."
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.000]   Are you able to talk to yourself, as it were? And are you able to know that the disappearance
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:29.440]   of all that, finally, is not important for you because of this other man that is here
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:34.400]   and that's going on, and will go on even when your body is rotting in some grave? Well,
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:38.960]   but the apostle tells us that there's something over and above that even. It's what happens
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:45.240]   to this inward man. This inward man, he says, is being renewed day by day. Though the outward
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:51.120]   man perish, the inward man is being renewed day by day. "That's why I am what I am,"
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.200]   he says. "This is what's happening to me. Here's the work of the Holy Spirit, of course."
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.400]   You see, we dealt the first Sunday morning with that our Lord Jesus Christ is not ashamed
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.840]   to call us brethren. Last Sunday, God is not ashamed to be called their God. God the Son,
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:11.000]   God the Father. Here's God the Holy Spirit. And you know, he's not ashamed of us. He's
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.600]   not only not ashamed of us, he's come to dwell in us. He delights in being our companion.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:21.560]   He is always with us. He is this other comforter that Christ said he's going to send when he
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.040]   goes. He'll be in you, he says. He's not ashamed of us. The Holy Spirit of God, the
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.720]   third person in the blessed Holy Trinity, comes to dwell within us. He's not ashamed
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:36.080]   of us either. The Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are not ashamed of us. And he
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.920]   renews this inward man day by day. How does he do it? Well, let me just give you some
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:45.840]   headings to think out for yourselves. Look at verse 10. "Always bearing about in the
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:51.160]   body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:39:00.400]   in our body." You see, he says it works like this. The Holy Spirit enlivens the inner man,
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:06.160]   and it enables him to think, and it gives him an entirely new view of suffering. Here
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.320]   we are suffering. Things are going against us. Perhaps you're being persecuted or reviled
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:15.520]   or misunderstood, or things are going against you. And at first you tend to flag and to
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.400]   faint and to falter, but as a Christian you don't. Why? Well, the inward man's being
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:23.520]   renewed by the Spirit, and he thinks, and this is what he tells you. He says, "You
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.960]   know, what you are really doing now is you're just bearing about in your body the dying
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:34.920]   of the Lord Jesus." He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. No one had a more
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:41.200]   difficult time in this world than the Lord Jesus Christ. Subject to our infirmities,
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:47.160]   he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh. He knew it all, nothing that you and I have
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.920]   to go through, but that he went before us, tempted in all points like us, we are yet
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:58.000]   without sin. Very well, says the inner man. What is happening to you now is just this,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.120]   that you in turn are bearing, carrying about in your own physical body, physical frame,
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:11.440]   the dying of the Lord Jesus. You are entering into the fellowship of his suffering. And
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:16.600]   you see, the more the outward man perishes, if you think like that, the more it drives
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.720]   you to think of the great privilege that's being given to you to be sharing with him
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:26.160]   in the fellowship of his suffering. In other words, the more your outward man perishes,
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.560]   the more you are driven to think of your inward man. That's how the inward man is renewed
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.440]   day by day. You see, the other man says, "My outward man is perishing, my faculties are
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:42.880]   failing, I'm obviously dying among the brink of the grave. There's nothing to be done,
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:47.600]   there's no use crying, I've just got to go. Oh, there's nothing more tragic to me
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.760]   than that Christian people should be facing the end of their lives like that. How do you
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.000]   face middle age? How are you facing old age? How are you facing the fact of approaching
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   death? Are you just shuffling to it, saying, "Well, it's got to happen, it happens to
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.240]   everybody." You know, Christian people shouldn't face the end like that. The inward man should
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.280]   be renewed day by day. There should be an advance and a development, and that's how
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:14.280]   it happens. The Spirit enlightens us, and we say, "Yes, oh, these things are things
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:20.000]   that our Lord himself knew. I'm following in his steps, I am bearing about in the body
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.920]   the dying of the Lord Jesus." But then there's a second thing. Listen to this. Why is this
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:31.480]   happening? He says, "That in order that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:36.400]   in our body." He repeats it in verse 11. "For we which live are always delivered unto
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:42.000]   death for Jesus' sake." Why? "That the life also of Jesus might be made manifest
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:50.880]   in our mortal flesh." Now then, here's the positive aspect. The life of Jesus is
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:57.000]   being made manifest in my mortal body, in my mortal flesh. What does he mean by this?
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.440]   Well, this is the most tremendous thing of all. As my outward man perishes, I'm aware
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:06.920]   of another life that has come in, and it's growing and increasing. Indeed, I couldn't
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:12.280]   carry on at all were it not for this other. What is this? This is the life of the Lord
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:19.520]   Jesus Christ in me. It is indeed a fulfillment of what he himself taught in John 6. I'm
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:26.240]   going to read from verse 54 to 58. "Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:32.280]   eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:38.520]   my blood is drink indeed. Now then, he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:48.120]   in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father, so
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:57.320]   he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. This is that bread which came down from heaven.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:02.120]   Not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead, he that eateth of this bread shall live
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:10.840]   forever. I am crucified with Christ," says Paul in Galatians 2. Nevertheless, I live.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:20.000]   Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me. That the life also of Jesus might be made manifest
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.920]   in my mortal body. In other words, he comes into you, and he lives his life as it were
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:31.480]   in you. And you are more aware of his life than you are of the death and the decaying
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:39.560]   of the outward man. The inward man is renewed day by day. The more you see the failure of
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:44.080]   everything else, the more you are driven to think of him, and to realize that he is with
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.720]   you, that he is holding you, that he will never leave you nor forsake you. He will always
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:51.960]   give you strength sufficient unto the day, and he will be in you forever and without
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:57.280]   end. Then carry on to verse 14, "Knowing," he says, "that he which raised up the Lord
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:05.160]   Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with him." The outward man
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:12.880]   is perishing. "Well, there it is," says the non-Christian, "even at its best. I'll be
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:19.120]   a man even until the grave. I'm not going to whimper and cry. That's all he can say.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:27.000]   He can say no more. But listen to the Christian. My outward man is perishing. Yes, but I know
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.320]   this, that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:37.960]   present us with you. The more I'm conscious of this body decaying, the more I'm driven
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:42.720]   to think of the resurrection of this body, because it's coming. That is the Christian
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:47.120]   hope. The Christian doesn't end with the life of the body. This body is going to be raised,
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:52.160]   glorified, renewed, and we're going to be presented to God with all glory and infinite
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:56.880]   grace. This is the renewing of the inward man, so that as you feel your old body is
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:02.680]   decaying and going, and all that around you is collapsing and disappearing, you say, "Well,
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:06.760]   of course, this is but the prelude to what's going to happen to me." And so your inward
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:11.120]   man is being built up and he's growing, and you're rejoicing. You were too weak to do
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.400]   anything else when you were left to yourself, but the moment you think of this, your body
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:19.360]   begins to thrill as with electricity. The thought of the resurrection, the life of God
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:24.920]   in the soul, the coming glorification even of the body. There it is. The inward man is
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:30.080]   renewed day by day like that. Do you know what it is in weakness to be thrilled with
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:36.520]   thoughts of the glory? There's no more precious experience than that. It's so wonderful that
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:40.360]   even your body can't stand it, and you have to stop thinking at times. You have to say
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:45.440]   to the inward man, "Well, don't go on, because if you do, you'll kill me even at this moment,
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:49.120]   and I meant to go on a little bit longer." The inward man's being renewed, and you feel
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:54.760]   his strength and vigor and power, though your natural faculties are failing in you and around
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:59.840]   and about you. And I add one other thing to it all. For all things are for your sakes
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:05.720]   that the abundant grace might, through the thanksgiving of many, redound to the glory
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:12.720]   of God. This is how the inward man is renewed day by day, the abundant grace of God. And
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:18.800]   my dear friend, it goes on day by day. God doesn't just give us a gift of grace when
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.840]   we are converted and become Christians, and then you gradually draw on that the rest of
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.120]   your life, and like your bank balance, it goes down and down the more often you draw
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:32.760]   checks upon it. That's not God's way. It's renewed day by day. As he sent the manna day
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:38.600]   by day, he sends this grace day by day. It's inexhaustible. It'll never come to an end.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:44.320]   Indeed, it increases. The inward man is renewed day by day. He gets stronger. He said that
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.480]   at the last verse of the previous chapter. "We all, with open face, beholding as in
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:56.480]   a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory."
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:01.600]   It's an advance. It's a development. You don't just get the same amount every day
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:07.120]   and exhaust it and then have nothing at the end of it. Not at all. It's increasing. It
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:14.120]   becomes larger and larger and from glory to glory. This abundant grace goes on giving
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:21.760]   to him that hath shall be given. And the more he has, the more he'll receive. It's a constant
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:27.920]   progression, change from glory into glory, till in heaven we take our place, till we
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:34.920]   cast our crowns before him, lost in wonder, love, and praise.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:42.920]   Well, my dear friends, there it is. This is the glory of being a Christian. Though our
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:49.920]   outward men perish, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. Is your inward man
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:48:00.560]   being renewed? Are you aware of his growth and his development? Are you receiving daily
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:07.600]   of this abundant grace, fresh supplies? New every morning is thy love. Does it come to
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:14.080]   you? Well, look to him. Wait for him, and he'll come. Live in the realm of the inward
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:20.840]   man. The outward is perishing. It is. We are perishing. The world is perishing. Change
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:27.840]   and decay in all around thy sea. This old world is obviously mortifying, putrefying,
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:36.160]   dying, and will die, will end. But is your inward man being renewed? Are you living this
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:44.280]   life in the Spirit, in the realm of the soul, in communion with God? And can you say quite
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:49.600]   honestly that the more you're aware of the decay of the outward, the more you're aware
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   of the growth and the development of this inward man? Dwell in the realm of the inward
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:05.120]   man. Ride very loosely to life, and all that comes through the outward man, that must end.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:12.360]   But this will go on to all eternity. Changed, I say again, from glory into glory, till in
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:23.480]   heaven we see his face, till we cast our crowns before him, lost in wonder, love, and praise.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:36.800]   Thank God that we can say, "No!" Nevertheless, because of the inward man in Christ Jesus.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:45.840]   Amen.
