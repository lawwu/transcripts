[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.120]   Welcome back. When we first started this show, our assumption is, most people would ask questions
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.520]   about the markets of their portfolios. That's the kind of stuff that came into my inbox.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.320]   Hence the name, Portfolio Rescue, right? But as the show has gone on to bring a more range
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.200]   of questions in, things will continue to expand. So we get questions now, barely any of them on
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.040]   markets or portfolios. Some of them are, but mostly it's taxes, retirement, insurance, spending,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.600]   housing, debt, and just a bunch of other topics, too. Sometimes people ask me fashion advice,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.160]   which I'm more than happy to give. So we felt it was time for Name Brand to better
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.680]   align the show with the questions that are coming in from our audience, because you guys are the
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.040]   ones that are giving us the topics every week. So Portfolio Rescue will now be called Ask the
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.760]   Compound. And it worked because we already had the email, right? Duncan, AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.280]   So it's not like it's a huge departure. Still going to be lots of investing in markets and
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.520]   portfolio-related questions, but Ask the Compound just makes more sense when you consider the breadth
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.920]   of questions that we get. We also weren't really rescuing that many portfolios. We had people
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.640]   writing in, "Hey, I make $400,000 a year." We're helping on the edges, right? Yeah. They were
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.320]   asking questions. So remember, AskTheCompoundShow@gmail.com. Our sponsor today is Bird Dogs.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.120]   Duncan, I just got a new shipment in of these bad boys. See them? They're so comfy. You got--
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.040]   Oh, yeah, yeah. I have those. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. The liner's great. My favorite thing is still the
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.440]   side pocket, because you put your wallet in there, and you don't sit on it. You don't think your rear
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.160]   end falls asleep if you're sitting on a wallet. I hate that. Go to Bird Dogs, BirdDogs.com. Use
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.760]   the code BenPR. BenPR. Still using the old Portfolio Rescue references here, but that's what
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.520]   they gave us before. You get a free Tumblr. I don't use a lot of Tumblrs, because I'm not a
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   coffee drinker. I know a lot of people use them, though, right? So remember, BenPR. Really quick
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.720]   here, the whole premise of this show has always been that our audience dictates the content,
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.920]   right? So the content. Each week, we pick the best or most relevant topical questions. Last week,
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.200]   there was a handful of questions with people who have six-figure salaries or seven-figure net
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.800]   worths, right? I have all this money, not to brag, all this stuff. A few people in the chat, listen,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.680]   I'm in there. I'm listening to you people. I'm hearing the feedback. They said, "All these not
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.840]   to brag questions are useless to me, because I'm not in that same financial stratosphere." Fair
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.680]   pushback. I'm willing to listen to feedback. I will say, though, a lot of this stuff does
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.840]   scale, though. You know, like, even if you don't have $4 million, a lot of the principles still
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.400]   apply that we're talking about. Here's the thing. So many of these finance questions are useful if
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   you know how to apply them to your circumstances, right? I started my career in the institutional
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.320]   asset management business. I worked with nonprofits who had portfolios of hundreds of thousands of
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.200]   dollars, millions of dollars, sometimes tens of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.800]   up to a billion dollars, right? So the circumstances were different for each of these organizations,
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.560]   depending on the size of their portfolio. But there were still plenty of similarities to how
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.160]   we manage the portfolios, right? Each investment plan looked at the organization's risk profile
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.960]   and time horizon and spending needs, and then created an asset allocation based on those
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.360]   premises, right? So the way I saw it is the investment philosophy is universal. The strategy
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.120]   is just personal. So I always thought, like, the billion dollar or hundred million dollar
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.800]   portfolios, it was just an extra zero. You still have to think of investing the same way. And I
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.280]   think that the personal finance topics are the same thing. Sure, this person has $6 million,
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.760]   and maybe you only have $60,000 saved in your IRA, but they're still thinking about a lot of
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.200]   the same things. Sure, your financial life becomes a little more complicated, and we have more money,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.400]   and maybe there's some other strategies on the edges that you have to think about. But the big
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.040]   questions, the behavioral stuff, getting the big building block stuff right is still exactly the
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.280]   same, no matter how much money you have. I've always thought that. And so what you're saying
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.520]   is go back and watch all of our old episodes if you haven't yet. Yeah. And what do you know,
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.440]   we got a handful of questions from viewers that don't involve not to brag situations this week,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.360]   so let's get into one. Yeah, and thanks for the questions, because yeah, we literally said last
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.480]   week, I think, these are the questions we're getting. You want to hear something different?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.640]   Send some questions. And people did. So up first, we have a question from Matt. "A few weeks ago,
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.520]   you got a question about paying off a 6.5% mortgage early versus investing that money. It
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.040]   seemed the consensus was against the early mortgage payments. Well, I have a 6% five-year auto loan on
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.840]   a truck that I use to haul a camper, which I live in full time. Since I do not benefit from the
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.160]   mortgage interest tax deductions, would it make more sense to aggressively pay off the loan in
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.360]   this case? I currently have enough money in stocks that I could pay this off if I sold everything,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.960]   not counting my retirement accounts. I own land that I plan to build a house on in the next two
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.240]   to five years. I'm 33, single, and I owe $40,000 on my truck. I have no other debt and make about
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.320]   $50,000 a year." This one sounds like a "House Hunters" episode. I like this one though. So the
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.200]   auto loan is different from a mortgage because we're dealing with different time frames and
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.160]   different financial assets, right? Houses have generally appreciated in value over time and make
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.080]   for a good inflation hedge over the long run. Automobiles, on the other hand, are a depreciating
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.160]   asset. I think the good rule of thumb is the minute you drive it off the lot, an automobile
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.680]   is going to be worth 10% less. I don't know if that's an old wives tale, but I've also heard,
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.320]   "Take an additional 10% off the sticker price every year for like five years." And that's your
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.360]   car depreciation, right? Housing is a form of consumption that I think has similarities to a
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.000]   financial asset. Automobiles are a form of consumption that have similarities to a liability.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.480]   That's the way I look at it. So, a hurdle rate of 6% per year is pretty simple on this one,
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.800]   but you should probably consider the tax implications of selling if you have any
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.560]   gains in the brokerage account. And you can do some cost-benefit analysis. I did a little back
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.120]   of the envelope here. $40,000 in debt at 6% over five years, we're talking $6,400 in total
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.240]   interest payments over the life of the loan. So, that's not egregious, but you can save
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.040]   yourself some money if you pay it off. So, that's your bogey in terms of taxes and opportunity
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.120]   costs if you decide to sell some stocks to pay it off. I think this one really comes down to
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.440]   psychology. Your expected return should probably be higher in the stock market, but if this is
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.080]   part of your living situation, that's potentially a different story. I think if you do sell some
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.960]   stocks to pay this off, and you pay the loan, just make a pact with yourself that you're going
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.920]   to use those monthly payments you would've been paying towards the car loan, and dollar-cost
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.640]   average right back into the market, or save for your house maybe that you're going to build
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.160]   sometime. So, if you're going to pay it off, don't let those payments go to waste if you
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.560]   decide to take care of them. Put those to good use, because then if you're taking away from a
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.360]   financial situation, you should help it out in other ways. Duncan, camper? Maybe is that
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.960]   your housing situation fixed? No, no. I'm happy to announce, I mean, we've talked about it, but
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.080]   yeah, after eight Airbnbs to start the year, I'm actually settled down in a new place now.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.480]   Seriously, eight Airbnbs? Yeah, eight Airbnbs. So, I did my due diligence. I'm not a shareholder,
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.680]   but yeah. All right, I am, so I'll take it. All right, let's do another one. Good experiences.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.920]   Overall, very good experiences. That's good. Yeah. Okay, so up next we have a question. I
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.960]   don't see the name. Okay. We have about $30,000 in credit card debt. My wife and I have decent
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:02.440]   jobs and live with a modest middle class Midwest lifestyle here in Wisconsin. I'm trying to picture
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.640]   what that means, but find it hard to put much towards the payments other than minimums. We are
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:14.280]   making credit card payments of $750 a month with $450 of that being interest, and they say their
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:20.400]   rates are between 14 and 20%. My wife recently left her job and has a $200,000 ESOP, is that
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.920]   employee stock option plan? Nailed it. Yeah. Balance that we need to roll over into an IRA.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.680]   I'm thinking of taking an early distribution on $30,000 to pay off these cards. I understand that
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.200]   there's a 10% penalty, but getting rid of a $750 monthly payment would be great for our peace of
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.960]   mind. What do you think? Love the show. Shout out Grand Rapids. My wife and I grew up in Western
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.640]   Michigan. Lots of Western Michigan shout outs. We're just blowing up here on the West side of
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:53.440]   the mitten. One of the things my father ingrained in my head from a young age, this is Ben's rule
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.840]   number one of personal finance. I'm not a shouter. I don't pound the table much. Pay off your credit
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:04.240]   card balance every single month. That's it. We're talking 15% to 20% interest. John, give me a chart
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.800]   on the average credit card interest right here. I think it's close to 18% or something. It's
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:17.920]   ridiculously high. This is an annual return that would make Buffett blush. There's no other
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.080]   expected return on investment that's going to do better for you than paying off your credit card
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.160]   debt. At the extremes, I think there's two types of credit card users. One, people who pay off
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.760]   their balance each month, and then they use a credit card for convenience or the ability to earn
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.720]   rewards. This group just doesn't or shouldn't care about what the rates are. Two is people on the
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.920]   other extreme who pay the minimum balance, have a hard time paying it down, and accumulate more
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:43.520]   debt over time because that's a huge compounding rate against you. So I like the idea of using
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.200]   credit cards to earn rewards, maybe build up your credit score, but if you're paying the minimum,
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.840]   you're just falling behind every single month. So you could do the cost benefit here of paying
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:59.760]   that 10% penalty. I'm guessing there's no benefit of not using that money to pay this off. So this
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.200]   person never really said how they got into credit card debt. That's probably maybe the first thing
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.840]   they should do after they pay it off. It probably makes sense to consider how you got in a situation
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.440]   in the first place, but I'm guessing it'd be a huge relief to pay it off, especially if you're
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.960]   only making the minimums. But I would think long and hard about how you got into in the first place.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.280]   Was this a big one-time expense that you had to do to get into it? Or is this just budgetary
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.040]   problems where you made some bad choices or you had no other choice, but you just credit card debt?
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.960]   So paying it off is great, but if you just go back into debt, that's not going to help much.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.320]   You know what I've found is the average person really does not understand how credit cards work.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.600]   And I don't even understand all the intricacies myself, and I've read quite a bit about it.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.240]   But people do not understand the compounding aspect of credit card interest rates.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.160]   Oh, no. I remember my sister, when she first got out of college, she said, "It's great. I'm just
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.280]   putting all this stuff in my credit card, and all I have to pay is the minimum every month." And I
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.640]   said, "Yeah, that's all you have to pay, but do you realize how much money you're accruing?" She
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:56.240]   didn't realize that the debt grew on itself. She didn't know. She had no idea. But this is the
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.720]   simple stuff where, yeah, you get rid of this, whatever you have to do, the Dave Ramsey snowball
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.920]   approach, whatever it is, get out from under it. And when are they going to bring these rates down?
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.400]   27% or 24% interest rates on credit cards? If credit card rates didn't come down with
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.240]   0% interest rates, I think they just never are. I think it's just unsecured debt, and they're
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.880]   always going to have people default. I mean, before you pay it off, it's worth it to call
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.000]   your credit card company and say, "We're paying the minimums here. Can you help us out a little
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.600]   bit?" Sometimes they could help you a little bit. They may laugh in your face and say, "No,
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.960]   pay it off," but it's worth asking. I'm kind of surprised that Elizabeth
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.120]   Warren hasn't gotten up in there and done something, you know?
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.000]   All right. Let's do another one. Okay. Question three is from Miguel.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.880]   "Big fan of all the shows. Thanks for the info you provide. I recently accumulated
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.160]   100 shares of a couple of blue-chip stocks -- Apple, Disney, Google, and AMD. Is it a good
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.840]   idea for me to start selling covered calls on these stocks?" Covered calls are something we
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.880]   never got questions about until the bear market, basically.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.440]   Yes. It does seem like a bear market. Let's bring our favorite stock prognosticator on here,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.720]   Mr. Josh Brown. Josh.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.640]   Hey, Josh. Hey, guys. So great to be on my favorite show.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.200]   Thank you, guys. Thanks for coming.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.640]   And a new background. Josh, these are the kind of things --
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.520]   I don't know if you know this. This is actually a penitentiary behind me.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.120]   It's a few snipers -- It does look like you have a prison yard behind you.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:27.280]   This is 39th Street, and our office faces -- no, not 39th. What is this?
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.120]   I don't know. We're on 40th, right?
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.200]   40th. We face 40th.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.280]   No, that's 40th -- no, 40th is the front of the building.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.240]   Yeah, yeah, you're facing 40th.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:44.720]   Okay, let me fix this. The western exposure of our headquarters looks over Bryant Park.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:52.240]   So you see, right? But that's facing down 40th in the corner, and then behind us is 39th.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.040]   It was nice of you to use your six minutes of sunlight to be with us today.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.000]   That was very nice.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.360]   So, Duncan's right. Covered calls are a bear market phenomenon.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.840]   No one talks about this when stocks are going up and we're in a bull market.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.880]   But when stocks are going sideways or going down, people say,
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.360]   "This is a free lunch. I'm generating income on the shares I own. What's the downside?"
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.120]   So do you ever dabble in options at all? I honestly don't.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.160]   I think it's like an extra added layer of complexity. That's not for me.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.160]   Some people swear by the income you can get.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.720]   I think it just adds a layer of complexity that some people don't understand.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.160]   Yeah. As a retail broker, we did this, and we loved it because it was two commissions
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.600]   on the same trade. You would sell a guy a stock, and then you would sell him a covered call
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.320]   to "protect the stock." And then if he got called out, it was even better.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.920]   Then it's another commission, and then another commission because you have to buy a new stock,
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:52.080]   of course. So retail brokers loved selling option strategies to retail clients,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:59.280]   but that's 20 years ago. So does this make sense for Miguel? I think no, because he said
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:05.360]   he's accumulated a couple of hundred shares. So what is the covered call premium that you're
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.280]   able to bring in from selling those options contracts? I mean, we're talking about not a
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.880]   lot of money for a lot of annoyance, a lot of aggravation to not really bring in that much
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:22.800]   money. Because if you get called out of one of these stocks, meaning you bought it, it worked,
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.600]   the stock went higher, and it was called away from you at a lower price than where it is,
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.440]   then what do you do? You buy it back, or you have to go find a new stock because you don't want to
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:37.120]   pay up for the stock you just lost. So I don't like it from that standpoint. Then there's tax
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:43.120]   consequences wrapped up in that as well. And then the other thing is, why are you buying them to
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:50.800]   begin with? Is it a trade? If it's a trade, and you want to use options to risk manage the trade,
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:56.880]   all right, I suppose. But this sounds like when you say the word accumulate,
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:04.880]   it sounds like you're accumulating an investment. So why would you want to put a ceiling over the
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.520]   upside of those stock positions? If you're going to be a long-term owner of these shares-
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.880]   Like I'm not sure what it accomplishes. Yeah. Get your income.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.840]   In the same way. Last thing, in 0% interest rate land,
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.520]   yeah, you got to do some stuff to generate income. But you don't need that now. You can
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:27.680]   buy a six-month or a one-year T-bill, and you can generate current income and leave your stocks
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:34.880]   alone. So I am anti that approach. And we've had people before reach out and say that there's ETFs
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.120]   you can get too. I would much prefer if you're going to do this and try to earn some option
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.880]   income, have a professional do it for you instead of trying to do it yourself. Understanding the
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.240]   absolute premiums, and that's hard. There are covered call strategies that are now
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:54.800]   in an ETF wrapper. So if you want to make that part of your portfolio strategy, I think you can
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:01.040]   do that in a pretty low-cost way and not have to be logging in and checking options all day.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:07.520]   So look, if you're talking about a million-dollar position, and it's a company you worked for,
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:13.920]   and you can't sell it, and there's a huge tax liability, but you want to protect that position,
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:20.800]   options are a smart way to do that. But that doesn't sound like this is the scenario that
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:26.560]   Miguel is describing. Yeah. It's not a free lunch. It sounds like it is, but it's not.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.040]   There's so much more that goes into it. It's much work. You're accumulating shares.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.600]   Yeah, it is. Keep it simple. Okay. I'm being told by Nicole to back up from my mic.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.040]   Thank you. Is this good? You guys can say it on the air. You don't have to hold up cue cards.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.960]   Hey, we try to be professional around here, you know?
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.480]   What is this, The Tonight Show? Just say, "Josh, back off your mic."
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.840]   We're working on it. We're working on it. Okay. Up next, we have a question from Tom.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:58.000]   "I'm in my late 30s, so I know I should look at this environment as an opportunity to buy
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.040]   at lower prices, but I'm sick of the bear market." Me too. "I got caught up in investing,
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   in tech in 2020 and 2021, so I'm down way more than the S&P 500, probably down 25% to 30% from
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.480]   my previous highs. It would help to hear your best and worst case scenarios between new all-time
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.520]   highs this year and a 1970s environment where we go sideways for years." I can relate to this
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.560]   question because I'm kind of bored. It's getting boring. Well, I think the last three years have
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.320]   kind of taught people the wrong lessons, that they think everything is a top or a bottom,
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.440]   and everything has to be like we either go up really fast or down really fast.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.520]   It's hard to wrap your head around this. Most of the time, the stock market is somewhere in the
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:41.920]   middle. Just by sheer definition, the stock market can't always be at a top or a bottom.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.680]   John, throw the chart up here. I looked at the new all-time highs by decades. It's actually
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:52.480]   been a decent amount in the 2020s. This is a great chart. I think there's roughly 2,500 trading days
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.760]   per decade. So if you average this out, it's like, I don't know, 6% or 7% of the time that we hit a
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:05.280]   new all-time high. So it doesn't happen as often as you think to hit a new all-time high. Even in
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:11.120]   the 1970s scenario where we had all this volatility and stuff, I think the stock market before
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:17.040]   inflation was still up 6% per year. So it's not like you went nowhere. It's a more volatile/boring
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.760]   market. I think people just want there to be an event that happens that, "Okay, we're back," or,
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.040]   "No, we're not," because we are kind of in the middle ground. The stock market was down 25%.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:32.720]   Now it's down, I don't know, 12% or 13%. So it does feel more boring, but maybe people should
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.800]   take that as a good thing. It's not always a bad thing that the stock market is not as volatile as
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.560]   it was the last few years. So I had this conversation with my driver yesterday coming
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:49.280]   back from the airport. And he's talking about how frustrating the market is right now. And
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.600]   he wants it to go back to new high. First of all, the two words that you need to remove from your
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:03.680]   vocabulary is "boring" and "exciting." Neither one of those should have anything to do with
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:09.760]   investing. That's one. Two, how old are you? Why do you want new all-time highs? Aren't you a buyer?
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:16.000]   Is this it? You're not going to buy a stock ever again? You bought tech stocks in 2021 and you're
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.040]   done? That doesn't seem likely. Are you 100 years old? So I actually don't understand why people
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.400]   can't... I mean, I do understand. It took me a long time. I shouldn't say that. I think that
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:37.920]   people need to refocus their energy and what they get excited about, because we're all forced savers.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:43.520]   My driver's young. This guy's younger than me. I don't understand. You're going to buy stocks next
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.000]   year, you want to pay up just so that the old stocks you bought are higher? What does that do?
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.040]   Are you selling them all and living on the money right now? Probably not. So if you're not a seller,
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:19:00.160]   like you're an accumulator, you're a buyer, boring is great. Flat market is great. 1970s would be
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:05.520]   okay. It's not great for our lives, but we don't have control over what's going to happen.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:11.840]   The one thing that the 1970s were great for, and 2000 to 2009, which was also a lost decade,
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:19.040]   is that every 401(k) contribution you made, you were heavily rewarded for during the next bull
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.160]   market. You just had to wait. So if you're not using the money tomorrow, I don't know why you
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.680]   want all-time highs. I think that's the biggest question. When do you need the money? And your
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.920]   point about the 70s, they didn't have 401(k)s back then. They didn't have the ability to invest a
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:39.040]   little bit of money out of every paycheck. And yeah, so having things... I know my retirement
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.840]   money is not going to be touched for, I don't know, 25, 30 years. It's sure it's not fun to
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.000]   look up at what your account used to be worth and realize like, "Oh, it's worth less than that now."
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.080]   But long-run returns are the only ones that matter. Yeah, right.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:20:00.000]   Listen, in an IRA, in a 401(k), you can't touch it. So what the hell do you want to... And you're
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.440]   contributing more to it. So you want to buy your parents' stocks from them at record highs? I could
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:11.680]   see why they would like that. Why do you want that? Yes, exactly. So I think that's kind of
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.600]   where you have to come down on, is just understanding that if you have the ability to
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.400]   make 12 or 24 or however many purchases you're going to make out of your 401(k) or IRA this year,
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:26.720]   and the market just kind of goes nowhere. And it is funny, though. People say the market's boring.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.840]   The S&P is still up, I don't know, 7% this year. That's kind of a lot for not even halfway through
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:37.360]   the year. So I know it seems boring, but... You know what else is funny? All the commercials
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.960]   on the radio. Like if you listen to Bloomberg Radio, CNBC Radio. So I often, when I'm driving,
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   I'll listen to Sirius XM. All the commercials are like people selling, like the way they sell
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:58.240]   is they start the commercial with, "In today's volatile times." Dude, just today? They were
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:04.000]   rolling that years ago, too. Yeah, back when... Yeah, every year. We've had less volatile years
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.280]   than this year, but we've had way more volatile years. We have a guy in West Michigan who's on
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.920]   all these billboards and he sells insurance and annuities, of course, and he's literally holding
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.200]   two safes on his arms. Like an actual safe. Like, "I'm going to keep you safe from the stock market
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.640]   volatility." It's so gross. You're right. Can we get Ben a billboard? Let's get Ben a billboard
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:31.600]   in Michigan. We don't... That's not how we roll. We only do business with fans. We don't trick
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.800]   people with billboards. If you're a fan of ours, you can become a client or stay a fan. You can't
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:43.040]   come in here through some bizarre channel where we put billboards up with a picture of a safe.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.520]   Never make it through our process. I've got no slogans, Duncan. Sorry.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.080]   Okay, okay. I tried. Last question. Okay. It was more fun, though, I have to say,
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.720]   when the market was going up every day. I miss those days.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.520]   Well, of course. Everyone feels better when the market's going up, but you should... Yeah.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:06.720]   It's like, "Am I up 3% or 4% today?" No, I'm just kidding. Okay. So question five is from Frank.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:12.480]   "My wife and I are 34 and we have very different views on finance. She would rather take more
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:18.320]   trips and spend more now while I have a savers mindset and want to work towards early retirement.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.280]   I enjoy the occasional trip each year, but not one each quarter. We also have a newborn on the
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.600]   way in two months. I'm of the mindset that we'll never be able to save enough, and that's based on
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   my upbringing. My wife's family did very well financially, so she's never seen the other side
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.680]   and what the struggles are like. I'd like to take more trips to make her happy, but I don't want to
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:42.000]   sacrifice early retirement. Should we lower our retirement savings rate in favor of more after-tax
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.400]   investing? We could still save but have access to the money if we wanted to take these extra trips."
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.880]   All right, this is the kind of thing that... This is a relationship problem.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.840]   Yeah. This is a psychologist kind of thing. I just got to get on the same page. Yeah.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.080]   Have you read the Die With Zero book yet by Bill Perkins?
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.360]   I haven't. You've heard this, Josh, or not? I know of it, but I haven't read it.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.880]   Okay. He was a hedge fund manager, an energy trader. I don't agree with everything in it,
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.040]   but I think it's kind of eye-opening. His point is that you should be spending now
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:14.800]   so... and not, say, waiting for the future. Just go for it, and your net worth should peak way
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.360]   sooner than you think. Your net worth shouldn't peak at 65. It should peak at, like, 50 and start
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.960]   spending it down. So that's one side of it. The other side is, how do you think about having a
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.960]   huge, like, just, like, philosophical disagreement with your significant other about how you should
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.080]   spend money, right? Like, I don't... That seems like something that almost should be handled before
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.200]   you get into the relationship as opposed to during, because I don't know how you're going
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.400]   to change the fact that I'm a huge saver and you're a spender. Where do we meet in the middle?
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.920]   I think it works. My wife and I are the opposite. Like, I get emails from, like,
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:58.480]   Madison Square Garden and Barclays and the UBS Arena, like, "This concert is happening." I'm like,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.240]   "I'm buying it. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going." She's like, "What are you doing?"
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:11.200]   But we hash it out, and we end up at a reasonable compromise. If it were up to me,
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:17.760]   I don't even know how much money we would have saved, not a lot. And I wouldn't... My attitude
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.400]   is I'll just go make more, because I'm insane. And I don't think about early retirement. I'm
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:29.360]   going to die doing this. Maybe today. Stay tuned, guys. So, listen, if you're doing something that
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:35.840]   you hate, then early retirement maybe is a goal. But hopefully, that's not the case. And maybe
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:42.080]   that's the bigger issue, that you're so focused on stopping working that you're willing to go 30
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:48.880]   years denying yourself things like family trips. And, like, in the end, like, what do you have to
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:55.200]   show for your life? It's the moments that you remember forever. Like, we took the kids to the
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.280]   Caribbean, or we did a cruise. I don't do cruises, but we did a cruise. Or, like, those are the
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.880]   things that really matter when all is said and done. And so, if you're not doing those now,
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:10.560]   when do you want to do them? I promise you, it doesn't become more fun when you're 60 or 70.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.920]   Here's the thing, too. If you hold everything back now and retire at 55,
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.440]   you're not going to hit a switch when you turn 55 and all of a sudden be okay with spending.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.840]   At that point, it's going to be even harder to turn this big around.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.720]   It's worse.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:28.320]   Yeah, you're right. The compromise thing is part of it, to say, here's our travel budget per year.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.320]   We're going to take either one really great trip or two smaller trips, whatever. You have to have
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.960]   some sort of compromise where you plan it out and put it into your budget and then figure out the
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:43.200]   saving from there. But yeah, I'm a big proponent of -- I'm more of a balanced person. Yes, I'm a
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:48.960]   big saver, but you have to get those experiences out of the way once you -- I'm middle-aged now.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.400]   I know that it's not going to last forever.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.800]   Out of the way? No, you have to -- it's your life.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:57.200]   Out of the way. All right, we knocked that one off the list. What's next?
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.040]   Listen, I'm a planner.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.080]   Hey, Seattle Michelle in the chat is pointing out -- I can't believe I've never
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.240]   noticed this before -- how much Duncan looks like The Edge from U2.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:21.440]   The reason that's relevant is I'm going to be in Vegas in October for one day,
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:28.640]   like a business trip, and it happens to coincide with U2, they're doing a residence at The Sphere.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:33.760]   And The Sphere is -- Madison Square Garden opened this state-of-the-art entertainment
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:39.200]   destination on The Strip, and I think U2 is the opening thing for it.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.400]   So I'm just trying to get sprinkles to buy a ticket and come with me,
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.480]   and let's go see U2 at The Sphere. And she's like, "Yeah, but we have to take
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:54.800]   our daughter to see two more colleges." And I'm just like, "Yeah, but when is this ever
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.040]   going to happen again? I happen to be in Vegas for something cool like this."
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:06.000]   So that balance, I'm not saying I'm always right or she's always right,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.120]   but you have to have those conversations. And so maybe this is less a financial question,
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.720]   it's more like a relationship question. And maybe you should just leave her.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.960]   No, I'm not saying that.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:23.200]   My wife and I are kind of similar. My wife, she'll spend on a lot of the small stuff and
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.800]   not think about it. When it comes to big stuff, she's like, "I don't know if we should get this."
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.400]   And I'm kind of the opposite. It's the little stuff that kills me for some reason, but the big
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.840]   stuff, I don't mind about. So it is this balancing act where I think it's good to have some give and
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.080]   take, but then you have to figure out what's the middle ground and what are your limitations
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.360]   you're putting on any of it. And also, John, we need a side-by-side of Duncan and The Edge,
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.920]   because that's a great call. Oh, man.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.400]   It's nice to see that Frank is empathetic here, right? Frank is trying to think about
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.520]   her side of the situation and trying to do right by her and not just be like,
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:01.680]   "We have to save every dollar." And we've had questions from people talking about spending
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.040]   tons of money on joining a country club or something, right? To me, something like taking
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.360]   trips is probably something that is going to enrich your life more. I don't know. I've never...
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.920]   Yeah, as long as you're not wasting your money on handbags. Yeah.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:19.040]   It's situational, because where I live, or not really my town, but on the north shore of Long
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.320]   Island, the country club becomes the center of your social life. It's where you meet with your
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:30.400]   friends every weekend. The guys play cards, you golf with your wife and another couple,
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:35.680]   and then your kids grow up with the kids of the other families, and it becomes like...
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.320]   I thought that was Starbucks.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:44.640]   No, no. It becomes a community. So I think it's a walk of life question also, when you're like,
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:52.080]   you can't just be like, "I'm not a country club guy. I have five seconds of attention for golf."
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:56.880]   But I'm saying that question, like, "Is this a good use of money? Is that a good use of money?"
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:02.080]   What's the context? What does it mean for your life and the experiences you're going to have?
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.920]   Do the people you care about, are they into that shit? Because then maybe that is the right way
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:14.960]   to spend money. So these are very rarely boiled down to a nickel and dime financial question.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.320]   A lot of this stuff is lifestyle.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.400]   - Our next spinoff is Couples Rescue.
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.920]   - I like it.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.480]   - Couples Rescue.

[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.800]   - Don't have me on for that.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.280]   - Josh, we have a new compounded friends tomorrow, correct?
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:32.720]   - We sure do. I can't spoil who our guests are, but they are a lot of fun,
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.000]   and we're going to have a great show.
