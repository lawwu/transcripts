[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   I think a lot of the airline run lounges, I would say there's two types of airline lounges.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.340]   One is the top tier carrier that actually cares about the product and cares about the
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.540]   customer experience a lot.
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.160]   But then there's another tier of airline lounges where the airline maybe doesn't care
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.900]   about the customer experience quite so much.
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.960]   And they offer it as an amenity just because they feel like they have to or something like
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.400]   that, or they might even operate it as a revenue driver.
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.240]   So for example, there's some places where airlines operate lounges that they don't
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.380]   even fly out of, but they do it because they want the revenue from Priority Pass or from
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.600]   other airlines paying them.
