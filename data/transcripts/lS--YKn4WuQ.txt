[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Today's question is about quarantine habits.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   We've all had a lot of time at home this year, and this is
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   a searching question from a young woman who wants to know what her quarantine
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   entertainment habits revealed about the state of her own
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   soul. Here's her email. "Hello Pastor John, it has taken this
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   period of total pandemic lockdown for me to realize that I don't read the
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Bible and pray when I'm stressed out. I had never noticed that
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   all I do is eat, sleep, and watch movies in my most
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   stressful times. This is exactly what I did in the first
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   two weeks of quarantine. I thought it would change, but after months
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I still have found little time to commune with God.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   It's both scary, sad, and I'm really
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   unhappy and tired. My question is this, if I went
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   so long without communion with God in this season of
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   anxiousness, does this mean I don't really love or trust
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   God to begin with?" I'm going to break that
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   into two questions. One is,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I think the least we can say is that your
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   experience in the last two months has shown that you do not love
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   and trust God the way you should. And my
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   question is, why would I say that? Why is there
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   a correlation between eating and sleeping and movie watching and saying
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   you haven't trusted and loved God the way you should? That's my first question.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Why would I even go there? And the other question is,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   how would we go about discerning whether you
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   don't really love and trust God at all
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   and are not a Christian, not born again? How would we do that?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   So let's take these one at a time, because both
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   are, you can see, really important. Heaven
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   and hell important. So first question, why would I say
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   that a young woman who devotes her discretionary time, especially
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   stressful times, to eating and sleeping and watching
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   movies, rather than say to solid
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   reading, meditating, praying over God's Word
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   and over rich food of good books that
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   mature and insightful people have written over the centuries
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   as well as other wholesome tasks, why would I say
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   that such a person does not love and trust God the way she
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   should? And the answer is, because loving God
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   means that God holds a place of
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   value in our heart, that it makes us
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   want to know him better and enjoy him
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   more and be near him in friendship and fellowship.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Movies are not well designed to do that. In fact,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   most of them are well designed to hinder that
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and to undermine the very thing that the
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   love of God implies, namely a passion to know him, a passion to
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   enjoy him and be close to him. Movies do not have that effect.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Therefore, defaulting to movies day after day
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   is at least a sign that love for God is weak
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   and probably growing weaker. John said in 1 John
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   5, 3 and 4, this is the love
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   for God, that we keep his commandments
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and his commandments are not burdensome. For everyone who has been
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   born of God overcomes the world, and this is the victory that has overcome
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   the world, our faith. What this passage
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   does is bring together the two things that this woman
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   is asking about, love for God and trust in God, love and
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   faith. First, John says, love for
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   God, delight so much in pleasing God and being close to God
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   that obedience to his commandments is not burdensome.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And then he attributes that sense of
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   burden, lifted enjoyment of God to the fact
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   that we have overcome the world. In other words, that
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   worldliness is not the dominant controlling
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   force in our lives anymore. It has been
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   broken, overcome. And then he explains, this is the victory
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   that overcomes the world, namely our faith. So, in
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   John's way of thinking, faith is the kind of
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   reality that receives God. Faith receives
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   God, receives all that God is for us
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   in Christ, receives him as such a precious
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   deliverance and help and treasure
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   that the world loses its power
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   to be the most attractive thing in our lives. So, love
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   for God and faith in God are, in John's
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   mind, overlapping or interlocking
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   realities. Each one is part of the other. And the
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   double effect of both, love and faith, together is, one,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   the power of the world to be our controlling treasure is
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   broken, overcome, and two, obedience has ceased
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   to be burdensome. It's not a burden to be told that
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   you must be done with what you hate to do. It's not a
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   burden to be told that you should indulge in what you love.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   That's not a burden, that's freedom. So, when this
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   young woman indulges in the excitement of movies
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   with more pleasure than she gets from the riches of
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   God's Word, John would say there is a defect here
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   in love for God and in faith in God. That's
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   my answer to the first question, why would we suggest a defect of faith
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   and love if she's just spending all her time eating, sleeping, and watching
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   movies? Now, here's the more important question, the one she actually posed, I think.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It seems to me that she is saying, "I went so long without
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   communion with God in this season of anxiousness.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Does it mean that I never
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   really loved and trusted God to begin with?"
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And here's the way I'm rephrasing that. How would we
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   go about discerning whether you don't
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   really love and trust God at all?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   How would we decide if you're not truly a Christian,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   not born again? And here's my answer.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's relatively simple. I would not spend
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   much time analyzing the failures of the
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   past two months, or even a more distant memory
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   of conversion and whether it was real or not. I think that kind of
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   introspection and past experience analysis
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   by and large does not produce the hoped-for outcome,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   namely assurance of salvation and peace of mind.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Our hearts are simply too deceptive. Our memories
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   and our powers of assessment about the past experiences
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   are too limited to see what we need to see. So my
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   answer is, repent now
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   with great seriousness about the failures of the past.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Name the sins and problems that you see. Tell the Lord
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   how you feel about that. Renounce unbelief and
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   lovelessness and disobedience and worldliness, and then
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   make a decisive turn away from the past toward
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   the future, the future of the next five minutes and
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   five months and five years and five decades and five centuries
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   toward that future, and believe Him,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   trust Him, and love Him henceforth. Now I'm
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   taking my cue with that answer from 2 Peter 1.10.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Be all the more diligent to confirm your calling
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   and election, for if you practice these things
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   (so he's talking about what to do right now and henceforth into the future)
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   if you practice these things, you'll never fall, for in this
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. In other words,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   the confirmation that we are truly called
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   and truly elect, truly the children of God, truly
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Christian, happens, the confirmation happens
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   by stepping into the future with faith
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   and obedience. Assurance of salvation does
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   not primarily come from the analysis of the past,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   but from the God-given earnestness of present
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   and future faith and obedience. So my
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   word to our young friend is, turn away
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   from the failures of the past two months, turn away
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   from speculations about whether your love and faith
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   was ever real, turn to the Lord of mercy,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Jesus Christ, and turn to the future
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   and walk with him boldly,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   joyfully, into that future with trusting
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   him and with loving him. Well said.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   There's an important little footnote I think to put on this episode. It's something I learned from you,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Pastor John, and really find helpful when we talk about entertainment. You alluded to
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   it at the beginning of this episode, and you've said it for years, and I just want to make it clear
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   as we conclude here. But the problem with entertainment is not necessarily that our
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   movies and our TV shows are inherently sinful
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   or celebrate sin or show no consequences for sin. All of
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   that is a problem, a big problem. But the most pervasive
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   problem with entertainment is that it presents a worldview in which God
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   is obsolete and he's presented as irrelevant
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   to our lives. Yeah, or to say it with more precision, he's
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   not presented at all. I mean, it's
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   the absolute void. I used to say back when people read
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   newspapers that you open the Star Tribune and you go page, page,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   page, page, page, and here's a whole section on business, here's a section
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   on leisure, here's a section on travel, here's a section on sports, a whole
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   section on sports, zero section on God. Not one
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   paragraph on God. I mean, the most important reality
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   in the universe gets zero attention in the newspaper.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Same would be true of most movies, or, like you say, if he
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   does get presented, it's presented in a way that does not
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   inflame our love for him, but questions his reality
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   and his usefulness. Yeah, that's good. That's good. As John Newton says,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   "The top headline on every newspaper every day should be, 'The Lord Reigns.'"
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Amen. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for joining us today.

[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   4:12-19, and it's a word
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   we all need to hear. That's up next time. I'm Tony Ranke.
