[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Unfortunately, due to the very poor quality of the original recording, the first few moments of this study in the book of Revelation by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones have been lost.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   The doctor has, in his introduction, summarised the various schools of interpretation of this book as follows.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   There are three main views.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   1. The Preterist view, that everything in the book has already happened.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   2. The Futurist view, the bulk of the book is yet to happen.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   3. The Historical view, that the things prophesied in the book started to happen immediately after John was given his vision,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   and that they have been happening ever since, and will continue to go on happening until the final judgement.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   The doctor now goes on to explain the Historicist view further.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Now, there are three main divisions, you remember, of this particular view.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   There is the so-called Church Historicist view, which says that the book of Revelation is nothing but a kind of praese, a praese of Church history.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   You know that you may read a great history book and then, for the sake of convenience, you make a praese of it,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   so that you may have the complete history, as it were, in smaller bulk and in a smaller form.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And there are those who have taught that that is the nature of this book.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Most of the Protestant reformers took that particular view.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   I mustn't stay with this, but it seems to me that that is a view that we rarely cannot hold,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   because it's too precise and has some of the defects which I'm about to elaborate in connection with the next subdivision of the Historicist,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   which is called the Continuous Historicist.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And perhaps, having dealt with this, I can just word again about the Church Historicist.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Now, the Continuous Historicist is the view which teaches this,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   that the things recorded here, these visions, were a vision given to John of things that were actually going to happen in a historical sequence.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   First of all, what we are told about the sea, and that they follow in chronological order, one to seven,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   and that the seventh contains in itself the whole trumpet series,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   but that the things there come one after another, trumpet number one, number two,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and that all these are distinct, separate events in history,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   one following the other in a chronological and historical order,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and that they will go on until the end.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And according to that school, it is estimated that we are now in the position roughly of the sixth vial, or the sixth bowl,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   which you will read of in the sixteenth chapter of this book.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I want to suggest to you that it has certain defects, which rarely, as far as I'm concerned at any rate,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   make it quite impossible to hold as a view.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And for these reasons, I would argue that what you get in chapter twelve alone is sufficient to prove that this view cannot be right.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You remember that last week we saw that in chapter twelve, you go back again to the incarnation, to the birth of our Lord.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Now, that in spite of the fact that in chapters ten and eleven, you obviously come to the final judgment, and to the end of all things.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   If the continuous historicist view is correct, well, then there can be no going back to the beginning again.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   In chapter twelve. And yet it seems so clear, as we shall see later, that you do go back like that to the beginning, in chapter twelve.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   To the very birth of our Lord.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Then another defect which this view has, it seems to me, is this one.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   That obviously it demands a very detailed knowledge of history.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   The history of the centuries.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   If we really are to derive any benefit from it.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   If all these things have reference to particular detailed historical events,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   then as Christian people, we can only derive benefit from the reading of this book,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   if we are real experts, not only in the total history of this country,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   not only in the total history of Europe, but in the total history of the whole world.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   It demands a detailed, expert knowledge of world history.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And therefore I think that is sufficient to demonstrate that that cannot be the true interpretation.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   For this was written for Christian people, most of whom were not very educated,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   and the Christians who have read it and have benefited by it throughout the centuries
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   have not by any means been great historians or experts in world history.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Yet that view in a sense demands such a detailed knowledge
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   before the book can be edifying for us.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Surely a very serious defect.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Another way of putting that same point perhaps is this.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   That if you do read the writings of those who hold this particular interpretation of the book,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   you will find an almost endless diversity of opinion amongst them
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   as to what the particular things mean.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   No two of them in a sense almost agree.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   One fixes on one great event in history to fit one particular sign or symbol,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   and another fixes upon another.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   So that you are really in a state of confusion,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   because these different symbols are applied to different historical events
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   by different members of the school,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   and I say in the end you feel that the whole thing is futile
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   and you really don't know what to believe.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Surely at that point the book has ceased to be edifying.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   In other words, I would argue that this is also true to say in general,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   that that very school of interpretation obviously opens a very dangerous door.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   We all know how easy it is to persuade ourselves
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   that we can fit certain statements in the scriptures to suit certain facts.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And the result is, you see, throughout the centuries
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   that people have been absolutely confident and sure
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   that a certain beast meant a particular person and so on.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   You know how in the time of Napoleon
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   they were absolutely certain that certain things here
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   unmistakably pointed to Napoleon and it couldn't possibly be anybody else.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   They knew, some of them, that previous ages had fixed it all on somebody else.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   In our time, of course, we don't think of Napoleon even.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   They were quite sure in our age that it was Hitler.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   The thing was absolutely perfect,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   and a certain detail had been discovered by somebody
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   that established it beyond any doubt at all, it was Hitler.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   But we no longer think that it's Hitler, and on you go.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Now, surely any scheme of interpretation
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   which tends to produce such a result cannot be the true interpretation.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It not only leads to confusion,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   but it surely does tend to bring the entire book into disrepute.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And as I have had occasion to say so many times,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I am increasingly convinced that large numbers of Christian people
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   have ceased to read this book, leave alone to try to understand it,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   because they're aware of facts like that
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   and they feel that by now the position has almost become ridiculous.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   In other words, can we not put it like this,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   that the moment you begin to try to attach the teaching of this book
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   to particular presents or events,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   you are in grave danger of turning from the spiritual to the material.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And indeed I think it is true to say, without being at all uncharitable,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   about many friends who belong to both the futurist and the historicist schools,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   that most of their talk and their conversation and their lecturing
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   does seem to be more political than spiritual.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   I remember hearing a few years ago,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I went to preach in a certain place in a certain part of this country,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I remember being told there that a friend of mine
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   who belonged to the futurist school had been preaching in that same place
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   just about a month before,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   and he had been preaching along these lines
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   and he had made a great announcement to them,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   that in secret history had come his way,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   to the effect that Stalin, with whom he identified one of these symbols,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   secret information almost had reached him to the effect
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   that Stalin was actually suffering from a growth in his stomach
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   and that his death was not going to be far removed.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Now this is going back about ten years ago
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   and I don't think that Stalin did die of a growth from his stomach.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I'm saying this to illustrate this point,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   that here is a man of God,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   who really seems to have spent most of the evening in talking about Stalin.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And I say that once you begin to interpret this book along those lines,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   you will find almost imperceptibly that you are doing so.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   You become interested in times and seasons,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   in particular events, in political events,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   and unconsciously your emphasis is there
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   rather than upon the spiritual content.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   I think I once did relate also an incident,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and I say this simply to illustrate the point I'm making.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   I'd once related on a Friday night when we used to meet upstairs in discussion,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   how I was travelling on another occasion to preach in a certain place
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   and at a certain station where the train stopped, a young man came in.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And I observed at once that he was carrying in his right hand
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   a copy of the times and the Bible.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   And I was able to forecast exactly what he was going to do.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And I was correct, he was going to a meeting
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   where he was going to give an address on prophetic questions.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And you see, he carried the symbols in his hands,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   not only the Bible but also the times.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Because you see, he understood the times from the Bible.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   What he'd been reading in the times was in the scriptures.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And he was going to give them the times as well as the scriptures.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Now, that is the kind of position that you tend to arrive at
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   if you adopt either the continuous historicist view
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   or indeed if you take certain aspects of the futurist view.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And surely, the moment we begin to do this, I say,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   we are ceasing to treat the book in a spiritual manner.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And yet it is a spiritual book with a spiritual message.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Now, I feel that considerations like that are surely sufficient
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   to make us reject the continuous historicist view.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And again, I would say that the same thing in general
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   does also tend to apply to the church historicist view,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   which says that it is oppressive.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   You are up against the same difficulty
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   of identifying particular historical events
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   with the things that are recorded here.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Very well, that leaves us to consider
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   what we may call the spiritual historicist view.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   The view which would teach that this is a book
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   which presents to us principles,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   the spiritual principles concerning the life and the conflict
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   and the final triumph of the church of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Not the exact historical details,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   but the great principles that are illustrated
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   and have been illustrated from the beginning until tonight
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   and are still being illustrated and will be illustrated
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   until the end, the final judgment.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   What confronts the church is here shown us in principle.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Well, now then, let me try to give you
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   some sort of a positive exposition of that view
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   of this book of Revelation,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   in order that we may compare it and contrast it
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   with the preterist, the futurist, and the historicist views
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   which I have already put before you.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Now, let's try to make an experiment.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Let's imagine that we have no theories at all,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   that we didn't belong to any school,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   but that we come to read the book of Revelation for the first time.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   We take up the book and we read right through it.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Let's observe certain general impressions
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   that the book makes upon us.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Now, these, I suggest to you, are certain things
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   which are quite inescapable if you allow the book
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   to speak to you directly itself.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   The first impression you get is that obviously it is a book
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   about the Lord Jesus Christ and his church.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   You see, it starts with him.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   It's a revelation that God gave to him
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and which he passes on.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   who bare record of the word of God
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   and of the testimony of Jesus Christ
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   and of all things that he saw.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   That's the great thing.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   And as you go through the book, well, you just see that everywhere.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ is before us the whole time.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   His church is before us the whole time.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   That's the great theme of the book.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   It was written to the church.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   It is written about the church.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   It is written to help and to comfort
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   and to stimulate and to edify the church.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   For John goes on to say, "Blessed is he that readeth
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   and they that hear the words of this prophecy
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   and keep those things that are written therein."
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Now, never forget that.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   There are some people who seem to think that the book of Revelation
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   is just a question of prophecy
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   and that it gives you facts and details
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   which you can fit into your jigsaw puzzle.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   But remember, we are told this.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   "Not only is blessed is he that readeth
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   and they that hear the words of this prophecy
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   those that keep those things which are written therein.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   For the time is at hand."
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   There is a great deal of moral exhortation here
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   and instruction to us.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Well, now, that's our first impression.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   The second thing that I would emphasize is this.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   It is a book of Revelation.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   It's a book that's meant to reveal.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   It's a book that is meant to unveil something to us.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   It's the apocalypse, the unveiling.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   It's a book in which the veil is drawn back
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   and we are given a sight of certain things
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   and an understanding of them.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Now, I'm very anxious to impress that for this reason.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   That these interpretations, I suggest,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   which we've already been considering,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   seem to have almost the exact opposite effect of it.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And they simply lend us in a state of utter confusion.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   So much so that people, as I say,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   have stopped even reading the book.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Because they say, "I don't know where I am.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   I'm absolutely muddled by these theories
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   and by these details and by the way things are added
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   which I don't see in the text
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   and where I find this great gap between the end of 3
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   and the beginning of chapter 4,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I don't see it in the text but I'm told it is there
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   and all these things and all this historical knowledge,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   I really am so bewildered, I don't know where I am
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   and the book says nothing to me."
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And yet the book is given to open our eyes.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   It's a revelation, an unveiling.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   It isn't meant to lead to confusion.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   It was meant to do the exact opposite.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Here was the early church suffering persecution
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   and the Christians were naturally bewildered.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   They didn't understand it.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   This book was given to them specifically and specially
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   to open their eyes to what was happening to them
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   and to what was going to happen.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   It's an unveiling.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   It's meant to bring things to our understanding,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   to help us to see things.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   An apocalypse, a revelation.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Yes, but I must hasten to add to that this,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   that the way in which it gives us this unveiling
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   and this knowledge and information
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   is by means of symbols.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   It's by means of signs.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Now did you notice a word in that first verse of the book?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   The revelation of Jesus Christ,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   which God gave unto him to show unto his servants
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   things which must shortly come to pass.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Now listen, and he sent and signified it
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   by his angel unto his servant John.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Now you'll find that some of the more recent translations,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   I believe I'm right when I say the revised version
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   and the standard revised version and so on,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   they talk about making known.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Now there's no doubt once more that this old authorized version
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   is very much near the original meaning.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   It puts signify,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   because the word that is actually used here
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   is a word that comes from the same word that means a sign,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   or a symbol.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And here it is at the very beginning,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   the revelation is given by means of signs and symbols.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   It isn't put absolutely plainly and directly.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   It is a revelation,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   but it is a revelation that also seems to partly conceal.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   It's a revelation in signs and symbols,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   and as you read through the book,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   you will constantly come across this sort of expression.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   "And I saw another sign in heaven."
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   It keeps on talking about signs.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   In other words, the knowledge and the information
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   which is given to us
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   is presented to us in this book in that particular form.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Now obviously, this is the most important point
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   and the most important principle in the interpretation of this book.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   You see, it starts off with lampstands.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   It talks about seals and trumpets and bowls and beasts
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   and things like that.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Now that's conveying truth,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   but it's doing it obviously in a pictorial manner
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   by means of signs and by means of symbols.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And I think so much of the trouble
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   with regard to the interpretation of the book has arisen
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   because people have tended to forget that
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   there is always this innate desire in us to literalize everything
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   and not to see that the book itself tells us at the very beginning
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   that it is an unveiling
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   and yet it does it in this particular, symbolical manner.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And not only does it do it in terms of lampstands and seals and trumpets
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   and bowls and vials and so on,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   but of course it uses numbers.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   You can't read this book without being struck
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   by the frequency of the use of numbers.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Take for instance the number seven.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Do you know that the number seven is used 54 times in this book of Revelation?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Seven heads, seven eyes, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls and so on.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Now, clearly these figures and other figures like time, times and half a time,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   three and a half years, 42 months, 12, 144 which is 12 twelves,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   and 10, and 10 multiplied by 10 multiplied by 10 meaning a thousand and so on.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   It's obvious at once that we are dealing with a book
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   which is conveying its truth by means of symbols.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   So that the figures that it uses are obviously not meant to be literal figures.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Six, six, six, the number of men and so on.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   It's most interesting to make a collection of the different figures that are used in the book.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   And you will find that the figures like these other signs that are employed
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   are obviously all of them symbolic.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   And the trouble arises when we forget that.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And when we tend to say, "Ah, but this figure must mean the exact number that it says.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   It says so and so, a thousand for instance, and a thousand must mean a thousand."
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   But surely if you read the book as a whole,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   you will see that there at certain points you simply cannot take these figures literally.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And that they're obviously not meant to be taken literally.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   It isn't merely 144,000 people who are going to be saved.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   No, no, that's a complete number.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   It's 12 squared and then the thousand comes in with its cube of 10.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   In other words, the whole thing is symbolical.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Figures of completion, figures of partial character.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Three and a half is half seven.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   And that's the prophetic way, as we saw in our hurried consideration of Daniel's prophecy,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   that is the way in which prophetic scripture does convey its truth always.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   It doesn't give it with that mechanical, literal exactness.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   It gives us exact knowledge, but in this symbolical manner.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   So that we are given principles without being given detailed knowledge in particular.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Now, in order to make this point quite clear,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   I'm suggesting to you that the book of Revelation does exactly the same thing
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   our blessed Lord and Savior did when he used parables.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Parables, you see, at one and the same time, reveal truth and yet, as it were, conceal it.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Parables do make straightforward statements of truth.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Yes, but because he spoke in parables, it wasn't clear to the outsiders,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   it wasn't always clear to the disciples.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   And when they had our Lord on his own, they asked him, "What did you mean by that parable?"
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Now, that is the characteristic of a parable.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   It is meant to convey some great truth.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   And it does convey truth, but it does it in a symbolical manner.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   It does it by means of a picture, by a figure, by a sign.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   And clearly, when you're reading a parable, you're not meant to press all the details.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   I think you've all probably either read or have heard examples and illustrations
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   of the kind of foolish and almost fatuous position at which you arrive
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   if you begin to take all the details in a parable and to apply them.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Many stories are told in that respect.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   I certainly once myself listened, when I was quite a boy,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   to a man preaching on the parable of the prodigal son in that way.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And he took hold of every single detail in the picture.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And he spiritualized it and fixed it onto something.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   But of course, time was passing.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   And the poor preacher had to give up at the point when he simply had to tell us
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   that had he more time or leisure, and perhaps he would do it the next time he came to us,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   he would deal with the fatted calf.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Now, that is the kind of monstrous position
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   at which such interpretations of Scripture inevitably tend to arrive.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Let us then take hold of this great principle
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   that our Lord is unveiling,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   but he is choosing this particular way to do it.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   And of course, it doesn't surprise us at all.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   John was writing to these early Christians who were living in the Roman Empire
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   and who were suffering certain things because of that fact.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And he wants to deal with that fact, but obviously he can't say it openly
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   because of the consequences, not so much to himself, perhaps,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   as to the people to whom he was writing.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   So he has to deal with the thing in principle, and he does it through a symbol.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   They would understand the meaning conveyed to them by the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   but the Romans reading it would understand nothing.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And the same thing is applied throughout the centuries.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   The thing is here in principle.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   You can apply it to particular facts.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   You don't say the book was dealing with those particular facts.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   No, no. But there is a common principle in these forces that work against the Church
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   and are antagonistic to our blessed Lord.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Very well. We notice that he does his unveiling, his unfolding,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   in this symbolical manner, exactly like the parables.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   So my final point under this general heading will be this one,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   that we must never lose sight of this fact, that this book is meant to edify.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   It isn't merely meant to give us interest.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   It isn't merely meant to excite us.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   It isn't meant to play up to our curiosity
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   and to our interest in current events and things of that kind.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   It was written, I say, with the object of comforting,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   consoling, giving instruction, exhorting,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   bracing these Christians for that which they had to face.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   And not only the first Christians, but all who should subsequently read this book.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   And as I've already reminded you on previous occasions,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   this book has been the strength and the support
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   and the sustaining power of God's people in times of fearsome persecution.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   You can read again the story of the Reformers
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and the Covenanters and the Puritans and others,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   and you'll find that they saw here in principle
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   the very thing that was happening to them,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   and it enabled them to go forward.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   It is a book, therefore, I say, that is meant unto edification.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   It isn't a book that is meant to enable you or me or anybody else
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   to be able to say, "Ah, of course, this is what I read of in the book of Revelation,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   and I can tabulate all the current events and find it here."
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   That satisfies one's intellectual curiosity,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   and we become interested in times and seasons,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   and we may appear to be very clever, and we're on the lookout for odd things.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   We may hear or read in a book about some person
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   who most people have not yet heard of.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   He's living on an island somewhere in the Mediterranean,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and he's the coming Antichrist,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   and he's going to do this and that, and haven't you heard it?
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   It's marvelous, and you hear all these details.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   But you know, people have been doing that sort of thing throughout the centuries.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Now, that, I say, is not the function of this book.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   It is a book that is meant to edify God's people,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   not to arouse a kind of unhealthy and almost morbid curiosity,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   and to make us more interested in persons and events
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   than we are in the truth of God,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   the truth concerning our blessed Lord and His church,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   and the great purpose of God for the Lord and the church
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   throughout the ages and right up until the very end.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Very well.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Read the book in general,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   and I think you will be forced to come to some such conclusions as those,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   so that obviously as we come to an interpretation of the book,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   I've always got to bear these things in mind.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   I must remind myself of its symbolical character,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   that it was deliberately put in this way,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   and I must look for the edification that I am to derive.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Well, having said that, I want to make another suggestion,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   that as you read through this book,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   you cannot fail to be struck by the fact that there are certain natural divisions in it.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   Now, I say natural divisions, not artificial divisions.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   There are certain natural divisions,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   and I want to put them before you this evening for your consideration and for your further study.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Now, take for instance the first three chapters.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Don't you feel as you read this book that these three chapters obviously go together,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   and they have a particular message?
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   It is the Lord Jesus Christ in the midst of the church.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ, if you like, in the midst of the churches,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   because the church is divided into churches.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   There he is, you start with that great vision of him,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   and he is there amongst the lampstands,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   which we are told signify and represent the churches.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   and the seven golden candlesticks.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Now, the danger at once is to say, "Ah, seven churches, seven particular churches,"
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   but again remember that these figures are used, these symbols,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   and seven is one of those perfect numbers.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   So the seven churches, I suggest to you, are the church, the church as a whole,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   and the Lord Jesus Christ in the church.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Not only that, you notice also in this first section
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   that it seems to span the entire history of the Christian era.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   In verse 5 of the first chapter I read,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   "And from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood."
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   You start with the blood of Christ, the death and the resurrection.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   But you see, you also go on to the end.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   "Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   and they also which pierced him, and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him."
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   The beginning of the Christian era, in the death and resurrection of our Lord,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   the end of the Christian era, in the final judgment, and not only that,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   there is teaching here about the redeemed, there is teaching here about the lost.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Now those are the essential, big characteristics of this first section.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   But go on to the second section, which runs from chapter 4 to chapter 7.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   What do you get from chapter 4 to chapter 7?
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Well, you notice you get the same things again.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   In chapters 4 and 5 you get this wonderful picture of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   The great scene in heaven in chapter 4, and then the consternation
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   because there was nobody big enough in heaven or earth or under the earth
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   to open the seals of the book, and then the announcement by the angels,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   "Weep not, it's all right." The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   is in the center, as he was in the first section in chapters 1 to 3.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   And again you see, we are made to look at him crucified and risen again,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   as a lamb as it had been slain.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   We are not allowed to forget that, but he is risen also, he has triumphed.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Very well, here is the Lord once more, and what has he got this time?
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   Well again, he has got a message for the church.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   And what is the message? It is this.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   It is that he is the one who controls history.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   He not only controls the life of the church, as we saw in the first section,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   here he is, you see, with this great book of history,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   nobody else can unfold, nobody else can control it,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   nobody else can break the seals, he can.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   He is the Lord of history. He can break the seals.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   He is the master of history.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   That is the message which he gives here to the church.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   And so you find him breaking the seals and unfolding the history.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   And what about this history?
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Well, again you will find that it is history that goes right on
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   to the very end of the age and to the final judgment.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   You will find that in chapter 6, verses 12 to 17.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   "And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   lo, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth of air,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   and the moon as blood, and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs," and so on.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   "The heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   and every mountain and island were moved out of their places," and so on.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   "The kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich, and the chief captains,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   and the mighty men hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   and said unto the mountains, Fall on us, why,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   the great day of the wrath of the Lamb is come, and who shall be able to stand?"
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   And you will find the same thing in the seventh chapter, verses 9 to 17.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   But on the other hand, there is this marvelous picture
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   in the seventh chapter of the redeemed,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   and we have already found them in the fifth chapter.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   These people have come up out of the great tribulation and have washed their robes.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Can't you see that in essence it is an exact repetition of the first section?
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   The Lord again revealing things to his church, and revealing this in particular.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   And it goes from the beginning right up until the end of the era to the final judgment.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   And we are shown the difference between the redeemed and the lost.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   The next section, chapters 8 to 11.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Now here we are told that after an interval of half an hour in heaven,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   something fresh is again given.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   And at the beginning of that eighth chapter we are given a wonderful picture
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   of the Lord Jesus Christ as our high priest,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   bearing our petitions and our prayers up unto God.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   And the result of that is that certain things are done.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   And you come to this extraordinary vision of the trumpets, the seven trumpets.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Obviously again a distinct section on its own.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   And what are these? Well, these are warnings of judgment.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   A trumpet is a warning always, and they are warnings of judgment.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   And read right through.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   And once more you will find that having started with the Lord at the beginning,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   you go on again right until the final judgment.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   The day of judgment at the end.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   You will find that in chapter 10, verse 7.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   You will find it in chapter 11, verses 15 and 18.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   But on the other hand, you will find a description of the church in chapters 10 and 11.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   You see, once more, we obviously are dealing with the same things.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   The Lord and his church and people, what happens to them in the world,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   the final judgment, the redeemed and the lost.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Same thing.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Then the next section runs from chapter 12 to chapter 14.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Here again you go back right to the beginning.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   There is that extraordinary description of the birth of our Lord, referred to as the man-child.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   You start with his beginning, you are shown the opposition to him,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   and how he was raised up into heaven, his death and resurrection, once more.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   The beginning of the Christian era.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Then the opposition that comes in, the devil and the beasts to which he gives power,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   and Babylon and so on, all these enemies of the church.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   But again the story goes on right until the final judgment.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   You will read in chapter 14, verse 8, "Babylon is judged."
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   The prophecy of that is given.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   You are obviously dealing with the end again.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   But on the other hand, in chapter 14 you are given that marvelous description again of the redeemed.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   You see, in essence we are looking at the same thing once more.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ is in the center, his people, his seed, the opposition,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   but the final judgment, the redeemed and the lost.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Go on to the next section, the fifth section, which you will find in chapters 15 and 16.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Again you start in heaven, and again you read about the Lamb,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   and again you read about his people, who are with him.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   They are always with him, and he is always with them.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   And again you come to the amazing description in chapter 16 of the bowls of judgment,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   the vials of rot that are poured out, and the final great battle of Armageddon.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Once more again you see you arrive at the last judgment,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   and you have the same distinction between the redeemed and those who are finally lost.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   The same elements, the same characteristics, the same features still appear.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   You go on to chapters 17 to 19, which is the sixth section.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And here again you have got another theme.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   And the theme this time, once more, is the way in which the enemies of our Lord and of his redeemed are dealt with.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   You will read there an account of the final destruction of Babylon, of the two beasts, and all their followers.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   But on the other hand, the redeemed appears as the bride of Christ, and the great marriage feast takes place.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   The final judgment has arrived once more, and still there is this great distinction between the redeemed and the lost.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   And the Lord himself appears in his glory, riding his white horse with the sword coming out of his mouth.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   The same essential characteristics.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   And that brings us to the last section, the seventh section, which runs from chapters 20 to 22.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   And again, I think you will find the same essential characteristics.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   The particular feature here is the final doom and destruction of the devil himself.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   And opposed to that, the triumph, the final triumph of the church, the eternal glorified state ushered in, the city of God coming down.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   The whole thing is finished and is complete, and the Lamb is in the midst of it all.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   And there is no need of the sun or of the moon, because he is there, and the light and the brightness of his face is sufficient.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Well now, there I suggest to you is something which you find if you read through this book
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   without concentrating very much at first upon any details at all.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   You are just allowing certain broad impressions to be made upon yourself.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   And I suggest that that is what you find.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   And that's a convenient point, therefore, for us to stop for this evening.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   We are suggesting that there is obvious in this book a principle of repetition, recapitulation,
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   a kind of parallelism in the different sections, and that these common features are to be found running right through the book.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Well, I say we can leave it at that for the time being.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   I do plead with you once more to read the book right through in the way that I am suggesting.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   Try to forget theories, try to forget anything particular, but just allow these big, broad impressions to be made upon you.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   And I think you will agree with me in coming to this conclusion, that whatever else this book is meant to do,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   it certainly is meant to tell us about the conflict between the Lord Jesus Christ and the devil and the powers of hell,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   the conflict between the Lord Jesus Christ and his church and his people on the one hand,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   and those other terrible forces on the other hand.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   And I suggest to you that as we look more closely into it, we shall see that that conflict began when our Lord came into this world.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   It began in Herod, and it has continued ever since, and will continue until his final victory, which is certain and assured.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
