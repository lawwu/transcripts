[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.600]   Old Testament Saint Daniel prayed three times a day. It was his daily spiritual pattern.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.200]   We see this in Daniel 6.10. And apparently everyone knew it was his daily pattern according
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.960]   to Daniel 6.13. John Piper picks up this point in the 1991 sermon and addresses whether consistent
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.600]   spiritual discipline is legalism. Here's a listen to what he said.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.600]   Daniel's prayer was a testimony not just to the glory of the Lord, but to the fact that
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.280]   his life was built on prayer. He was making a statement, not just about God, but about
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.880]   his relationship to God. Had he not prayed, God would be the same, probably his relationship
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.200]   would have been the same, but one thing would have been different. What the satraps thought
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.240]   about Daniel's relationship to God. Oh, I see, when it's dangerous, he doesn't do it
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:05.360]   anymore. Daniel knew that his testimony was at stake and therefore he got down on his
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.600]   knees on the second floor before the open window three times a day and he prayed. He
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.320]   lived by prayer. He consulted what God thought and he asked God to act.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.920]   Daniel's prayer was disciplined and regular. When the time for a demonstration came, he
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.480]   didn't have to do anything different than he was already doing. He had disciplined himself
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.080]   for years probably at that window three times a day and he simply said, "Will I maintain
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.960]   my discipline or will I forsake my God-given discipline?" And he said, "I will not forsake
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.800]   it at the cost of my life. I will not forsake it."
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   I wonder if it strikes you as strange, like it does me, that very few Christians in the
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   American Evangelical Church pray like this, statedly disciplined three times a day. Does
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.920]   it strike you as strange that nobody prays that way these days? And I think there are
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.960]   a lot of people who would say, "That's real good because it shows that we have discovered
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:15.880]   freedom from legalism." Now, I might believe that. I might believe that if I saw people
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:24.320]   who did not have Daniel's discipline as powerful in prayer as Daniel was. But I don't believe
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:32.120]   it. In fact, as I analyze the American Evangelical Church today, the creeping legalism that I
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.600]   see is not Daniel's disciplined prayer three times a day. I do not think spiritual discipline
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:49.320]   is the Trojan horse in which legalism is making its way into Troy the church. No way, Jose.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:56.800]   We are not in a thousand years in danger of becoming legalists through spiritual discipline
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:05.240]   in the American Evangelical meet-my-need, cushy Christianity. In fact, I think that
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:13.000]   the kind of legalism that is creeping in today is virtually the opposite of spiritual discipline.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:23.240]   It has two sides to its coin. On one side is fear. The fear of anything that comes close
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:32.640]   to sounding or looking like biblical discipline, expressed in sentences like, "Train yourself
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.840]   in godliness. Strive to enter by the narrow gate. Take up your cross daily. Work out your
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.200]   salvation with fear and trembling. I pommel my body and subdue it. If you're right, I
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.520]   offend you. Gouge it out. Strive together with me in prayer." Anything that comes remotely
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.520]   close to sounding like such discipline is feared in the new legalism. For centuries,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.880]   the disciplines of the Spirit have marked the great saints, and today they are feared.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:20.040]   The other side of the coin of the new legalism is a demand for psychologically correct speech.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.960]   Not politically correct speech. We all know what that is. Psychologically correct speech.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.520]   If you don't use certain language to describe morality, ethics, duty, and the commandments
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.520]   of God that are psychologically correct, you are a defective people helper and do more
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.160]   harm than good. Taboo. A new list of taboos in the legalism that I'm talking about. And
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.280]   the new list of taboos is "Thou shalt not use must. Thou shalt not use should. Thou
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.560]   shalt not use ought. Thou shalt not use warnings like 'Those who do such things shall not
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.480]   enter the kingdom.'" This is the new legalism and the new list of taboos. You must not say
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:12.760]   must. They are simply not psychologically correct ways of talking about reality. The
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.760]   creeping legalism in the American evangelicalism today, I believe, is not the spiritual discipline
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:27.040]   of Daniel, who prayed three times a day. I urge you to consider whether some of our
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:35.440]   weakness rather in cushy, self-indulgent, so-called spontaneous "meet my need" American
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.600]   Christianity is owing not mainly to bondage to legalistic lists of do's and don'ts,
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.480]   but rather to the fact that we have forsaken biblical discipline.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.040]   To write. That's a short point worth thinking about. 24 years after this sermon was delivered,
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.400]   the audio quality is a little bodgy, but that is a classic clip from John Piper's 1991
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.360]   sermon, "Daniel's Defiance of Darius in Prayer." And it was sent in to us by Jessica
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.600]   Cole in Sydney, Australia. Good on ya. Okay, enough of the Australian slang for today.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.480]   If God is most glorified in me when I am most satisfied in him, does this mean that God
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.960]   is never glorified by those who don't love him? John Piper joins us tomorrow to answer
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.800]   a really important question. I hope you join us. I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.480]   tomorrow, mates.
