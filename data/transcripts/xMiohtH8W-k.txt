[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360]   In assessing how serious somebody is, you said, it's fair, you called it the F word.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.360]   I like that.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'll never forget that.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.480]   Just ask a fair question, like, how much money do you think you deserve?
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.200]   Or would that be a good example of a very direct question?
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.160]   Or is it, how likely are you to walk away if we don't give you the money?
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.560]   Because I could imagine there's all sorts of reasons why people would be dishonest about
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.560]   answering those questions.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.920]   Well, and then how much money do you think you deserve is a really good question.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.200]   Not necessarily what the answer is, but how they answer it.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.040]   You're going to get how quickly they fire back and whether or not they stop and think
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.120]   about it.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.680]   How and what questions typically are best to judge the other side's reaction, and the
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.700]   answer is secondary, because the how or what question causes what we would refer to as
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:10.280]   deep thinking, slow thinking, Danny Kahneman, behavioral economics, thinking fast and slow.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.940]   Slow thinking is in-depth thinking.
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.000]   You ask a how or what question to make the other side think first and judge their reaction
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.560]   to how they think about it.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.920]   And do they actually think about it, or do they fire right back at you?
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.000]   It gives you a clearer picture of who you're dealing with, where the outcome is going to
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   go.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.260]   How much money do you think that you deserve if they immediately, you know, $10 million?
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.360]   So this is, I got a shakedown artist on the other side.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.760]   Or they say, all right, if they stop and think about it and they give you a thoughtful answer,
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.880]   that's a completely different person on the other side.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.840]   You're asking a question to get a, to diagnose how they respond first, the answer is second.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.000]   And sometimes I, if it's a cutthroat on the other side, I'm going to start peppering them
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.440]   with how and what questions just to wear them out.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.920]   That's passive aggression.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.660]   If I, if I got a cutthroat aggressor on the other side, I'm going to drop into passive
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.600]   aggressive behavior to slow them down and wear them out.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   One of my hostage negotiation heroes, a guy named Johnny Pico, was John Domenico Pico,
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.820]   not Johnny like Johnny Rockets, Italian Johnny, John Domenico, got all the Western hostages
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:38.760]   out of Beirut in the mid 80s, wrote a book called Man Without a Gun, negotiated in person
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.000]   face to face with Hezbollah, the only guy that ever did that, got everybody out.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.400]   And in his book, he wrote one of the great secrets to negotiation is learning how to
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.720]   exhaust the other side.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.560]   And when you've got a really dangerous adversary on the other side of the table, you don't
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560]   go nose to nose.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   You don't argue.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   You don't, you're not combative.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.040]   You wear them out, exhaust them.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.840]   And if you get somebody really combative or cutthroat on the other side, start peppering
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.400]   them with how and what questions because to even think about the answer tires them out.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.080]   And it's passive aggressive and it's deferential and it really works.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.440]   So if the person on the opposite side of a high friction negotiation is aggressive, the
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:35.760]   goal is to slow things down, fatigue them, and get them to just either relent or to reveal
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.520]   something that's a loophole.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.080]   If I have to make the deal, then I'm going to wear them out.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.200]   I'm interested in drilling a little bit further into this process of wearing them down and
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.800]   the passive aggressive way of reducing the aggressor's stance.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.720]   And I want to highlight for people that what we're talking about here isn't manipulation
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.960]   to extract something.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.960]   We're actually talking about the reverse.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:12.680]   We're talking about a bad actor who's aggressive and trying to defang that bad actor.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.840]   What does that process of wearing them down look like or sound like?
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.840]   Could you give us a couple of examples of, let's say I'm the bad actor, we could play
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.840]   this game.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.120]   I won't be very good at this.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:34.160]   And I am saying, look, I want x number of dollars by this date or you're not going to
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.280]   get what you want.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.280]   They're going to die or disappear.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.560]   Is that simple?
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.920]   And I'm a stonewall kind of approach.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.800]   What is the approach that you take to wear that person down?
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.480]   Well, they're going to be questions that are mostly how and what.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.200]   And they're going to be legitimate questions, which is how do I know you're going to follow
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.560]   through?
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.160]   What does that look like?
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.800]   Like if I do what you want, how do I know you're going to follow through?
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.760]   So get them to talk about the alternative.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.760]   Okay.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.000]   So if you were to, well, if you deliver by that date, I'm going to pass them to you
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   without fail.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.600]   So they're just getting kind of brief answers where the person is just, again, this kind
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.840]   of like rigid stonewall approach.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.360]   Well, and so there's a phrase that we use all the time, vision drives decision.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.480]   So if you're really going to comply, if I give in, and when I said, how do I know you're
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.120]   going to follow through, I'm not talking about the threat.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.840]   I'm not trying to get you to clarify the threat.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.960]   I'm trying to get you to clarify what implementation looks like.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.400]   So I need to know I'm based on your reaction to that.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.840]   If you plan on following through, if I comply, you will already have that in your head or
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.560]   be open to it.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.560]   Vision drives decision.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.360]   You've thought it through in advance.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.160]   What does letting the hostages go look like?
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.760]   If you have no intention of ever releasing the hostage, if I follow through, then you're
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.680]   not going to be able to answer the question and you're probably going to throw it back
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.280]   on me really quickly.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.160]   And so then now I know like, all right, so you got no plans on complying.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.320]   If I give in, you're not going to comply.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.600]   So I, but you still want the money.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.920]   Then I'm going to ask, well, how am I supposed to pay you if you don't have any plans for
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.400]   complying?
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.880]   And if you're willing to entertain a conversation about what compliance looks like, there was
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:58.240]   a kidnapping that my unit worked just before I was in it in Venezuela, where they weren't
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.240]   entirely sure that the bad guys were going to, the FARC I think had the hostage.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.400]   They agreed on an exchange point to let the hostage go that was some distance from where
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.120]   they had a pretty good idea the hostage was being held.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.080]   So they figured they're not going to drag the hostage all the way to this river crossing
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.080]   if they're not going to let them go.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.480]   It's just too much effort.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.680]   And then it was one of the few times there was going to be a simultaneously, theoretically
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.840]   a simultaneous exchange, but they're going to have to send the money across the river
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.480]   before the hostage was let go.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.320]   So if we agree to this, all right, so they're not going to drag this guy all the way to
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.320]   this river crossing.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.720]   If they don't plan on letting them go, and if it's a long way to drag them and they got
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.400]   their money, do they want to drag them back?
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.520]   Like even if they're ambivalent, once they get there, if they've gone through all the
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.520]   effort to get to the meeting location and the hostage is there, we've now just increased
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.960]   the chances significantly they're going to go ahead and comply because it's a pain in
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.340]   the neck to take them back.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.880]   This is all human nature stuff, human nature investment.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:08.440]   How do you get them to engage in actions and behaviors and then verbal commitments that
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.080]   actually mean something to them?
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:15.120]   When I was working kidnappings, the very last thing we'd always have the family get the
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:21.680]   bad guys to say it, last, not first, but last, was we'd actually get a verbal promise to
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.440]   let them go.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.880]   Again, at the end, because we've been talking to them long enough at this point in time,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.680]   we got a pretty good idea of what they sound like when they're lying and what they sound
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.280]   like when they're telling the truth.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.560]   If somebody tells the truth, they pretty much tend to tell the truth the same way every
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.200]   time, if they tell the truth.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.040]   You talk to somebody long enough, you got a line on, do they ever tell the truth?
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.680]   If they do, what does it sound like?
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:53.040]   People lie 20 ways, they tell the truth one way.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.600]   We've been coaching in negotiations with the kidnappers long enough that we know what they
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.760]   sound like when they tell the truth.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:04.960]   When they ask at the very end, if we paid your promise to let them go, it's not that
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.660]   they answered, but how they answered it.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.520]   That'll be the last thing to seal the deal.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.360]   How do you continually stack the odds in your favor for implementation?
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:21.760]   [MUSIC]
