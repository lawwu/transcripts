[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.720]   Paul's second epistle to Timothy in the first chapter and the twelfth verse. The twelfth
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.520]   verse in the first chapter of Paul's second epistle to Timothy.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:29.240]   For the witch cause also I suffer these things. Nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I know
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.320]   whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.000]   unto him against that day.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.040]   Now I am calling attention to this great word for the third time and again I must remind
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.720]   you of the context of the statement because as I am trying to show it is a statement that
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.480]   can only rarely be understood if it is taken in its own context and setting. Nothing is
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.480]   more dangerous than to extract texts out of their context. So let me start reading at
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.720]   verse six where the apostle says in writing to this young man Timothy, "Wherefore I put
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.680]   thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.400]   on of my hands. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.280]   and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of the Lord, nor
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.120]   of me his prisoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.840]   the power of God who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.600]   our works, but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.280]   before the world began, but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.760]   who hath abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.520]   whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles, for
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.640]   the which cause also I suffer these things. Nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.520]   whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:25.560]   unto him against that day. Hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.400]   in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus, that good thing which was committed unto thee
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:41.200]   keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us." Now then, there is the context and the setting.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.080]   But what we are primarily concerned about is this mightiest separation of the great
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:55.720]   apostle who was writing from prison, with his life in the hands of one of the most capricious
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.800]   despots and dictators that the world has ever known, the Emperor Nero, who might decide
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.640]   at any moment to put him to death. The apostle, here he is, he has become old before his time
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.720]   and can call himself Paul the Aged because of his strenuous labors and because of his
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.640]   sufferings. Here is a man who had brought into being a number of groups of people called
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.040]   churches in different parts of the then known and civilized world, started a great work,
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.160]   but in this precarious position, having as it were to leave it all. And here is a young
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.400]   man, one of his followers and disciples, Timothy, who is very troubled and perplexed and unhappy
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.560]   and bewildered, knowing that this mighty man, this kind of foundation is liable to be moved
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.720]   at any moment, and therefore filled with foreboding and fears with respect to the future. The
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.640]   apostle writes to him, and in a sense he just tells him to pull himself together. He does
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.840]   not stop at that, of course, because if he stopped at that it would not be the gospel.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.840]   He does not tell him to cheer up that everything will soon be all right. He does not say that
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.520]   because that is just psychology or coercion and not of necessity true. What he does is
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.440]   to say this, "Pull yourself together and remember what you have heard of me." That
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.880]   is what he tells him to do. In other words, he points him to the gospel. And he does that,
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.080]   of course, for this reason, that it is the gospel that gives us everything that we need.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.920]   Look at this man, the apostle himself. Here he is in prison, I say. He says, "I am in
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.000]   prison because I am a preacher, as you know. If I had not been preaching this gospel I
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.760]   would not have annoyed my fellow countrymen, the Jews, and they would never have handed
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.520]   me over to the Romans. I would still be enjoying life as it were as a Pharisee. But I am in
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.320]   prison, and I am in prison because of these things. Nevertheless, I am not ashamed."
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.280]   He does not mean by that merely that he is not ashamed of his gospel. He means that he
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.600]   has not been put to shame. He is in no difficulty. He is not unhappy. He is in no trouble. Quite
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.960]   the reverse. He uses this figure of speech called "Laitetes," in which he uses a negative
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:16.480]   to say a positive. Another illustration of that is what you get in Romans 1.16. The apostle
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.320]   says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ." What he really means is, "I am
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:29.120]   exulting in it. I am very proud of it." We sometimes make statements powerfully by
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.640]   using a negative, don't we? It is said to be the characteristic English mode of expression,
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.880]   that you don't use superlatives but that you express ideas which are superlative by
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.840]   means of negatives. You say, "I am not ashamed." You mean, "I am tremendously
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.120]   proud of it." And that is what the apostle is saying here. "I am not in trouble. I
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   am not in difficulties. I am not wondering whether I have been wise and right in preaching
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:00.880]   the gospel." Quite the reverse. "I am in a gloriously happy condition because I know
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.720]   him in whom I have believed and am persuaded and I am certain that he is able to keep that
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.720]   which I have committed unto him until that great day." Very well.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.840]   Now then, the whole case I am putting to you is this. It is the apostle's own case.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:27.600]   That what enables a man to face everything in this way is the gospel. Our claim for the
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.640]   Christian gospel is that it is the only thing offering itself to the world tonight which
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:40.320]   enables us to face life, death, and eternity. It is comprehensive. There is nothing for
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.920]   which it does not cater. And our whole argument is that that is the secret of this great apostle.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.560]   He is not able to speak like this just because he has got a peculiar temperament,
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.760]   because he happens to have that particular sanguine psychology. It is not that. The
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.320]   gospel can make you a natural pessimist as happy and as joyful as your natural optimist.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.000]   It has done so on thousands of occasions in the long history of the Christian church.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.120]   We have got a great record, you know, of confessors and of martyrs. You think of the
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.040]   great covenantors in Scotland and all the great Protestant martyrs and many other martyrs,
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.720]   all testifying to the same thing. It does not matter what your temperament is.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:29.760]   You can be given this mastery of life if you only become as the apostle was. It is not his
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.240]   temperament. It is not that he has taken up a certain belief, a certain philosophy, or anything
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.400]   like that. There is only one explanation. And that is what he tells us himself. It is his belief in
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.880]   the gospel. He says, "That is why I am what I am. It is because of my faith. It is my belief in the
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.680]   gospel." He reminds Timothy of that. He says, "Look here, Timothy, you must hold this fast,
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.960]   you know. This form of sound words that I deliver to you, you must hold on to that. You must be
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.360]   absolutely certain of it. That deposit that was given you, guard for all your worth. Then you
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.720]   will be all right. If you do not, you will be timorous, frightened, alarmed, panicky, even as
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.920]   you are at the present time." Now that is the essential argument of the great apostle. And I
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:20.320]   say it is still our great recommendation of this gospel this evening. Now you notice that I say
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.040]   the great recommendation of the gospel. Do not misunderstand me, my friends. I am not here
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:31.200]   as a kind of salesman or representative of the church, trying to improve the church by trying
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:38.880]   to get you a patronage. It is exactly the other way around. I am here to tell you of the blessing
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:46.640]   that God alone can give you. I am simply recommending in that sense, because of this
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:54.320]   great gift which the gospel holds out to all men everywhere. Very well then, I say, the essential
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:01.600]   question before us is this, what is this gospel? If the apostle is as he is because of his belief
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:07.120]   in the gospel, if he is telling Timothy that he can be the same if he holds fast to this belief
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:13.920]   in this gospel, well then the vital question is, what is the gospel? And here is the question that
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:20.640]   we are facing together. And as I have been pointing out, unfortunately it is a question
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.560]   that has been made difficult for the modern men because of all this modern confusion.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:34.320]   Because men are saying that something is gospel which is not a gospel. Ah, but sir, somebody,
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.440]   that is only your opinion, is it? Well, let us examine this situation. Let me remind you of what
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.840]   we found so far. There are some people who tell us today that you cannot even tell what the gospel is.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.680]   They do not like doctrine. They say they do not like theology. They do not like definitions.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.440]   The gospel is a wonderful spirit which you catch. It is a wonderful feeling that you have some great
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.760]   experience. And they say, but you must not talk about definitions. You must not talk about
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.800]   propositions. Well, I have dealt with that. The apostle says that he is a teacher,
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:12.960]   and a teacher must have something to teach. He tells this man to hold fast the form of sound
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.160]   words. There must be words then that are not sound. This great apostle, it has spent a good
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.240]   deal of his time in correcting error and heresy, in condemning it, in showing that it was not what
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:32.080]   he calls in the next chapter, my gospel. He is dogmatic. He says there is a deposit of truth,
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.280]   a deposit of faith, and if you do not believe that, it is not a gospel. He tells the Galatians,
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:43.120]   these others, he says, are preaching another gospel which is not a gospel.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.040]   There cannot be more than one gospel. He says, though we or an angel from heaven preach any
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:55.280]   other gospel unto you than that which we have preached, let him be accursed. Listen,
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:02.160]   hold fast, he says, the form of sound words which thou hast heard from me. This is the thing,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:08.080]   this testimony of the Lord. If your gospel cannot be defined, my friends, it is not a gospel.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.440]   The New Testament is full of warnings about antichrists, about false teachers. How can you
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.960]   test? How do you test the spirits? Every spirit is not the spirit of God. How do you test the
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.640]   spirits? How do you test any teaching? Has any man got a right to get up and say, well, I am a
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.040]   twentieth century man and I am living in a scientific age and I think that all that has been taught in
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.480]   the past is wrong, this is God, not as you have always been taught, I say this. Has a man such a
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:45.520]   right? According to the New Testament, he has not. How do I arrive at that? Well, I tried to show that
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:51.680]   last Sunday night. You arrive at a knowledge of truth not by means of reason, but by accepting
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:59.120]   revelation. The world by wisdom knew not God. And this idea that you need something fresh or new
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:05.200]   in the twentieth century is, as I see it, the greatest denial of all of the Christian gospel.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.360]   If centuries make any difference, well, then we can never know what the gospel is.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:19.520]   You will say that what was true in the first century was not true in the second, not true in
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:24.640]   the tenth, not true in the twentieth century. Truth is always shifting and changing. It is
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.360]   not something stable, it is not something once and for all given, but something tentative.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.240]   And then you are certain, even as you accept it, that it will be proved to be wrong in fifty or a
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.760]   hundred years' time. This whole notion that you cannot define it or that it is always changing
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:47.600]   is a denial of the very elements and foundation of the Christian faith. No, no. There is an
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:54.640]   authority, and the authority is the authority of revelation. We know nothing about God apart
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:01.200]   from what we are told in this book. I mean in an ultimate sense. And therefore, as I point out,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:07.280]   you either trust your own reason or else you will submit to this. Or as the apostle puts it,
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.640]   "If any man willeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be made wise."
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.760]   He means this. If you do submit yourself to this, you will be dismissed as a fool. They will say,
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.560]   "Why, that man, where is he living? Doesn't he read the books? Doesn't he know anything
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:27.040]   about science? Is he still believing that old Bible message?" They will say that you are a fool.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.680]   "Let them say it," says Paul. They were saying that in the first century. But he says it is the
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:38.400]   only way to become wise. You submit to this and you will get real knowledge. The world, by wisdom,
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:44.640]   knew not God. And man knows no more tonight about the great fundamental questions of life
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:52.480]   than he did in the first century. This is still our only authority. Very well, what is its message?
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.320]   What is this message given to us from the apostles downwards? Given to them by the Lord
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:06.560]   Jesus Christ, passed on by them, this thing that the apostle Paul says to Timothy, "Hold it fast,
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.200]   this message that I gave unto you." And he says elsewhere that what he preached,
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:16.320]   all the other apostles preached. There were no different views amongst the apostles about God
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.680]   and about salvation. They were all preaching the same message. Why? Well, they had been given it
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:28.880]   by the same person. The one and only message based upon this apostolic witness. You see,
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:34.800]   it is what he calls in the eighth verse, "the testimony of our Lord," which means the testimony
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:41.840]   concerning our Lord. This message that was delivered to the apostle, he says, "I delivered
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:48.720]   unto you first of all that which I also received." The message was delivered to him, he delivered it
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.400]   to the people. He was nothing but the transmitting station. He was not the originator of the message.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:02.080]   He was given it and his apostolic authority by the risen Lord from heaven. That is the thing
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.040]   that makes him an apostle. And then the Holy Spirit came upon him, and in demonstration of
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:14.800]   the Spirit and of power, he announced, he declared the truth of God. And that is still our position
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:22.720]   tonight. Very well then, what is the message? Well, that message, as I am saying, is very
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:28.480]   perfectly summarized for us in this very passage that we are looking at. The apostle gives us here
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:34.240]   a very wonderful summary of Christian doctrine. You will find it repeatedly in the New Testament.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.840]   I was saying this morning, I repeat it tonight, these apostles were very, very fond of giving
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:45.600]   synopses of Christian doctrine. They delighted in saying the whole thing all over again. Fancy
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.480]   this apostle writing to a preacher, Timothy, and reminding him of the elements of the gospel and
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.360]   of salvation. Why? Well, because he is wise enough to know that even the preacher gets
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.800]   into trouble when he forgets the fundamental truths of the gospel. And there are many preachers
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.440]   in trouble today because they have departed from the fundamental truths. They do not know it,
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:11.120]   but this is the message they need. We all need it. Very well, what is it? Well, here is the summary.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:19.280]   And of course, the early church produced other summaries of it. What are these creeds that
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:24.400]   people talk about? They get up in certain churches and they recite creeds. The apostles' creed,
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:30.000]   the Nicene Creed, the Athanasian Creed. What are these? Well, they are just summaries again
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.960]   of Christian doctrine. And there they hold out before us these cardinal elements without which
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:43.440]   there is no Christianity. And that is the very thing that the apostle does at this point. And
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:50.560]   that is what you and I have got to consider together. Now then, why am I emphasizing this
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:58.320]   thing? Well, I am doing so for this reason. The great principle outlined here by the apostle,
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.840]   the thing on which his whole position depends, cannot be put in this form.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:10.320]   That there is nothing more fatal in life than to start with particular problems and to discuss them
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.440]   immediately and directly. That is, of course, what we all tend to do by nature.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:22.640]   We are interested in our particular problems, and we ask our questions and we want a discussion
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.720]   about the particular problem. We say, "What does Christianity have to say about this?"
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.120]   and so on. Now, the answer to the Bible is this, that that is a fatal procedure.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:38.480]   No particular question or problem can be understood according to the Bible except in
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:45.920]   terms of the whole. You do not start with a part, you start with a whole. The particular
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:52.640]   is only understood in the light of the general, the whole. This is, of course, an absolutely
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.760]   vital principle. I am so concerned about this that I would ask your
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.840]   indulgence and pardon if I used an obvious illustration.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:11.360]   To be over-concerned with the particulars at the expense of the general or the whole
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:20.080]   is exactly like a doctor who is only interested in symptoms and is unconcerned about the disease.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.440]   That is a very profound principle in medical practice. You can take it from me.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:32.480]   You see, the patient is always interested in symptoms. Naturally, the patient does not know
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:39.040]   anything about diseases, so he is very naturally interested in his symptoms. The patient is
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.760]   interested in his headache, or he is interested in the pain in his side, and all he wants is
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.520]   something to get rid of the headache, something to get rid of the pain. He is not interested in
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:55.760]   anything else. That is, of course, because of his ignorance. A symptom is not a disease. A symptom
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:02.080]   is one possible manifestation of a disease. The thing that is really important is not the symptom,
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:09.600]   but the disease. Symptoms, if you like, are the amazing provision of nature to guide the expert
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:16.480]   physician to a diagnosis of the disease. And that is where the whole question of medical science
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:22.800]   comes in, that men began to observe that certain diseases displayed certain symptoms. So then,
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.600]   you can start with a symptom, and if you know your job and handle it properly, it will lead you to
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.800]   the disease. And the thing for you to treat is the disease. You do not stop there, just
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.840]   medicating symptoms. If you do, you will be doing a grievous injustice to your patient, and he may
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.240]   eventually lose his life because of that. You see, you can give him an injection of morphine,
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:47.200]   the pain is gone, and all is well. But it is not. You see, if it is a cancerous growth, it goes on
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.200]   growing. The patient says, "I have got more pain." Give him another injection, and you can go on
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.680]   injecting and injecting and injecting. And the patient thinks you are a very kind doctor, but he
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:02.960]   dies of cancer. The business of the doctor is not to give his injections, but first of all to discover
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:09.120]   what is the cause of this pain, what led to this symptom. And he does not medicate the symptoms
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:15.200]   until he does know exactly what is causing this particular symptom. And then he is in a position
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.480]   to deal with it, and incidentally in dealing with a disease, he will get rid of the symptom.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:28.320]   Now Christianity is exactly like that. It is difficult for us to grasp this, isn't it?
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:36.400]   I have given you a simple illustration. It is as difficult as this, that even medical students
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:42.080]   find this difficult. A man feels he would like to become a doctor, and he wants to be a doctor,
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:49.520]   but he has got to spend a most worrisome first year in doing chemistry and physics and biology.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.840]   "What is the use of this?" he says. "I want to be treating people." But he is meant to do chemistry,
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:21:00.080]   physics, and biology. Then he has to spend at least, he used to at one time, at 18 months or so,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.600]   in doing anatomy and physiology, not looking at a patient at all, not coming into contact with
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:13.120]   human beings in terms of patients, but wearisome dissection, discovering nerves and blood vessels,
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.080]   and all sorts of things. "Oh, what an utter waste of time. Why can't he be treating people and
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:23.680]   handling diseases?" Well, you see the object, don't you? If you haven't got a fundamental
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:29.600]   knowledge of anatomy and physiology and so on, and if you don't know something about the working of
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.720]   life and drugs and things like that, and certain principles in chemistry and even in physics,
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:40.320]   you won't be able to be a good doctor. You have got to have a background of knowledge.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.960]   You have got to have a great background, and then you can relate everything into that.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.160]   If you don't know your anatomy, and if you don't know how these anatomical structures function and
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.040]   work, you won't really be able to diagnose. You won't be able to interpret your symptoms.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:01.040]   You see, you have got to go a great way back. You have got to discuss a great whole before you can
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:07.360]   really bring your mind to bear in an intelligent manner upon some particular problem. Now, all that
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.160]   is a perfect illustration of what the gospel teaches and what the apostle Paul is teaching
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:19.120]   Timothy at this particular point. My friends, the individual problems of life
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:28.560]   can only be understood in the light of the whole problem. A man comes to me with a particular
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.960]   problem and says, "Why this? Why that? Why does this happen to me?" and so on. Now, if I answer
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:39.680]   him immediately and directly, I'm being a very bad spiritual physician. A man comes to me and says,
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:44.560]   "You're a Christian. You're a pastor of a church. I want some help from you." You know, I can't help
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.840]   him in those terms. The first thing I want to know is this, is this man a Christian or isn't he?
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:55.840]   If he is a Christian, I at once know the line on which I can deal with him and help him. If he's
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:05.120]   not, I really can't help that man until he becomes a Christian. I can't medicate his symptoms until
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:11.120]   the disease has been dealt with. I can't answer him his particular question unless he accepts
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.640]   the whole total view of life, death, eternity, which the gospel provides.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:23.760]   Now then, I say this is this tremendous question. People today are concerned about particulars.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:31.120]   I believe the world is in its present predicament politically, socially, with all our moral
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:38.400]   problems and everything else, for one main reason. And that is that we've forgotten first principles.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:48.720]   We have forgotten the fundamental postulate. We are missing the wood because of the trees.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.280]   And the result is we are going entirely wrong. Take one simple illustration.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.920]   There's a whole problem in question of moral delinquency, so-called, juvenile delinquency,
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:05.280]   and so on. And you see they're setting up commissions, royal commission after royal commission,
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.640]   and trying to examine and to investigate. They thought it was due to poverty. They now see it's
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.120]   due to affluence and so on. But you see they're wrong every time. They don't ask the fundamental
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:20.480]   question. What's the fundamental question? The fundamental question is this, what is man?
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.440]   Why does anybody want to behave like that? These are the fundamental questions. But you see,
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:33.440]   we don't face them. We rush the particulars. We must, we must go back. Before I can answer
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.680]   you a question of what's wrong with the world, I've got to make you face this question,
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:43.040]   what is the world? What is it? Where does it come from? What's it meant to be like?
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:48.240]   Before I can answer you a particular questions about men and his conduct and behavior and
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:54.960]   misbehavior, I've got to ask you to face this question with me. What is man? What's he meant
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:02.720]   to be like? What's he doing in this world? What is life itself? Well now then, I say,
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.400]   the whole tragedy of the modern age, the whole confusion of the modern man, I am suggesting to
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.760]   you, is due to the fact that he's in too much of a hurry. He wants to have a kind of penny,
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.320]   or it now becomes sixpence in the slot machine. You put in your coin and you get out what you
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   want and there it is. And we're all in a desperate hurry. My friends, you've got to stop.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:29.360]   And you've got to stop and think. And the gospel is here in the world above everything else to call
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:34.800]   men to stop and to think. We haven't got ready-made answers to all the questions. It's
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:40.960]   not a ready-reckoner view of life. Here is a great profound view of everything. And your
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.680]   particular question and problem can only be dealt with in the light of the whole.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:53.600]   Now then, that's my involved way of putting to you what the apostle puts here to Timothy.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:59.520]   You see what he's saying is this, "Timothy, get back to the first principles.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.280]   Don't consider me and my death and what's going to happen. Get back to the fundamentals.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.800]   Get back to the Lord himself and all he's done and all he's said. Get there, stay there,
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:20.960]   then you'll never be troubled." That's always the way. So you see, as we come to try to understand
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.800]   what makes a man say, "imprisonment face to face with death, nevertheless I'm not ashamed,
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:33.520]   for I know in whom I have believed," the great question we start with is this, "What is life?
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:39.360]   What is the world? What is man? What's it all about?" I can't tell you what this particular
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:45.520]   thing means until we're agreed as to what it's all about. Very well, we start with question number
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:57.760]   one. What is this world and life in which we find ourselves? Here's what somebody said about it,
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.880]   "All the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:12.160]   They have their exits and their entrances. And one man plays many parts, his acts being seven ages."
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:19.520]   Then he goes through and he ends with this, "Last scene of all that ends the strange eventful
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:29.760]   history, that last scene of all that ends the strange eventful history is second childishness
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:42.080]   and mere oblivion. Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything." Is that right?
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.280]   I've quoted Shakespeare,
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:54.240]   and not simply because it happens to be this anniversary.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:09.920]   Whoever wrote those words, was he right? Is that life? Is that the world? Is that it?
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.480]   Do you just start at this school by and go through the seven stages
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.960]   and end in that more or less gibbering condition and then nothing?
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:29.360]   Is that life? Is that the world? Is that man? Well, you see, if it is, well then my whole answer
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.240]   about the particular things that are happening is dependent upon that. You ask me about the bomb,
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:39.040]   you ask me about war, you ask me about theft and robbery and misdemeanors and so on, well,
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.240]   my answer is going to be determined by my total view, if that is the truth.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:52.720]   And that is the truth held by most people today? Well, then there's only one inevitable result,
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.600]   and that is the modern confusion, for the reasons I'm going to give you.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:04.960]   Now then, what are the views about life? Well, ultimately, in the last analysis,
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.200]   there are only two possible views. There are what we may call the non-biblical,
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:16.080]   or the extra-biblical views, and the biblical view. I mean now about this whole business,
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:22.960]   the world, life, man, death, what lies beyond the whole thing. Now, non-biblical,
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.320]   what is this based upon? Well, of course, it's based upon nothing but speculation,
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:36.800]   pure speculation. Just what a man says, what a man thinks, the theory a man puts forward,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.920]   everything based on reason, as we were considering last Sunday night. What does it come to? Well,
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.400]   what it comes to is this, that they say that the world is really an accident.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:52.960]   Now, I'm not caricaturing this, God forbid that I should, the thing is much too serious,
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.600]   but the view is that the world is literally an accident.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:09.120]   It's purely a matter of chance. You know the theory about the two planets,
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:15.440]   and how they passed too near one another at a given point, and one knocked a piece off the other,
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:21.120]   which fell into space and eventually became the cosmos. Accident, chance,
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:27.040]   you can talk if you like about evolution, but you see what it all comes to is this in the end,
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:34.720]   that everything is to be explained in terms of some great force, impersonal, not a personal force,
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.360]   not a personal mind, no understanding, no reason, but force.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:46.560]   The Frenchman called it the "Alan Vita," but it's just force, that's all it means still,
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:54.640]   and that everything is the result of the operation of this force. Now, that is the essence of the
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:00.240]   non-biblical view. There are endless variations, of course, but that's what they all come to.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:06.240]   Now, why do I say that these are to be rejected, and why do I say that they're inadequate? Well,
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.560]   they're inadequate for this reason, that they don't explain, of course, to us the ultimate
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:16.800]   origin. When I'm told about these two planets, I want to know where they came from. Or if you
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:23.280]   tell me that there was just some sort of original gas, I ask, "Where did that come from?" They don't
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:30.160]   know, they can't tell us. There is no adequate explanation of ultimate origin, but not only
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:37.680]   them. They're so totally inadequate to explain the facts and the phenomena by which we are confronted.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:43.920]   Look at the order in nature, look at what we call the laws of nature,
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:50.560]   look at this amazing regularity, spring, summer, autumn, winter, look at the design
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.000]   and all that you see in flowers, in animals, and so on, the symmetry, the perfection,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.240]   and all these things. Now, I say that force, accident, chance, an evolutionary process,
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:08.400]   it doesn't account for it. The thing is too perfect, it's too wonderful, it's too extraordinary,
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:14.160]   and that leads me to another argument which, as always to me, seemed almost irrefutable.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:23.840]   And that is the subtlety and the wonder and the balance in certain things that one finds in
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.800]   nature. I believe I've said this before, whether I have or not doesn't matter, but the thing is
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   worth saying. I've always argued that the human eye alone is more than enough to me to prove that
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:45.680]   there is a God, a Creator, this delicate, sensitive organ, so refined, able to discriminate as it does
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:53.760]   this little organ which so governs the whole of our life in almost every respect. Is this accident?
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:33:00.560]   What about the various stages through which it was passing until it became this? How was the
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.760]   animal able to survive at that point? You talk about the survival of the fittest, how could he
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.960]   have survived in these intermediate stages? I can understand his surviving when he's got his eye,
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.880]   but what about these incomplete, inchoate stages through which he's passed? No, no, the whole
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:23.520]   thing is so perfect, such a perfect instrument beyond anything that men could possibly make,
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:30.640]   that it postulates a great mind, a great designer, a great artist. Well, that's just putting in my
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:36.480]   words what the late Sir James Jeans came to at the end of his long life, wasn't it? When he said that
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:41.600]   he had come to the conclusion that at the back of everything there must be a great mind.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:48.480]   Or as somebody put it, that God is a great mathematician. You see, the mere facts of
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:54.960]   nature, I say, can't be explained in terms of a blind, mechanical, unintelligent force.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.040]   We know something about blind thoughts, we see it in a fire, in an avalanche, or something like that.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:07.840]   What does it produce? Order? Disaster. No, no, these explanations are not adequate, and then
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.560]   when you come to ask, well, is there a purpose in it all? And the answer they give is that there is
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:19.120]   no purpose. If you really want to base your whole view of life, and to answer your individual
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:24.640]   questions, and solve your individual problems in terms of scientific humanism, well, then listen
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:30.080]   to one of the leading scientific humanists, Sir Julian Huxley, and he will tell you quite honestly
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:38.720]   that there is no object, or end, or purpose in the whole of life. None at all. It is all accident,
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:44.880]   and you've no ideas to what may happen. It may go up, it may go down, nobody knows. There is no end,
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:52.000]   or object, or design. Now, that is inevitable, I say. And, of course, that is the view of life
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.600]   outside the Bible. We had an illustration of it in that portion I read at the beginning from Acts 14.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.480]   You saw what the pagan world was like. We saw it last Sunday night in Athens, even in Athens.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:09.760]   You see, they are at a fall back upon the gods. And here they are, when they find Paul and Barnabas
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.240]   performing a miracle, they say, "These men are gods. One's Jupiter, one's Mercurius. Paul,
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:18.400]   the speaker, must be Mercurius." And they are about to worship them. That's the world, you see,
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:27.280]   without God. Everything accident, and chance, or fate, or luck. And there may be these unseen
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.160]   gods at the back of it all. Life, that's it, it's just a mystery, it's an enigma, it's a problem.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:39.520]   Is there purpose? None at all. Is there hope? Simply none. No hope at all. If you have a bad
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.920]   time in this world, well, it's bad luck. You must just try to make the best you can of it,
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:51.520]   or else you'll fall into a state of cynicism. A very able, clever man of the Victorian era,
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:57.040]   he had adopted all these ideas, and he'd become a cynic. And this is how he expressed his philosophy
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:02.880]   of life, Walter Savage Lander. "I fought with none, for none was worth my strife.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:12.000]   Nature I loved, and next to nature, ah! I warmed both hands before the fire of life. It sinks."
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:20.160]   And I am ready to depart. That's life, you see, if you take it without God, and without the
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:25.520]   biblical revelation, without this testimony of God that the Apostle Paul preached everywhere.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:30.480]   "I fought with none." Why not? Well, none was worth my strife.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:37.600]   A bit of conceit mixed up with your cynicism. It isn't worth fighting, nobody's worth fighting.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:44.960]   What you live on, well, nature I loved. Beautiful scenery, I got something out of it,
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.680]   it made me feel happy for a while. I got away out of the dusty, dirty cities,
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.960]   and onto a mountain top. Nature I loved, and next to nature, ah!
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:01.680]   The artist, he was able to help me a good deal. And I must say, I've had a very good time. I
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:08.480]   warmed both hands before the fire of life. And I had a wonderful time. Midday, there was a great
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:13.360]   blaze, and tea time, it was still there. And I was warming my hands, we were all happy together.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.880]   But the fire's going out, and do what I will, I can't stop it. The artist can't stop it,
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:24.240]   the nature can't stop it. The fire's sinking, I'm getting old, the end is coming. It sinks.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:31.280]   All right, you can go out as a gentleman. I am ready to depart. But you don't know where you're
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:38.960]   going. You've got no hope. It's all come to an end. What is there in it? Is it worth all the fuss
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:45.120]   and bother? You see, that leads not only to cynicism, but ultimately to despair and suicide.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.800]   It's not worth it. If there's nobody worth fighting, in a sense, life isn't worth living.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.880]   At least if things go wrong, why should you stand up against them? To be, or not to be,
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:58.720]   that's the question. There it is again, you see. And you're left in the end without an answer,
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.840]   you don't know. You've got certain fears.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:11.600]   Thoughts of that unknown country from whose born no traveler returned, but for that.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:18.240]   With my native view of resolution, I'd soon solve the problem, but, so I don't.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:23.920]   Well, now then, there you see is the commonly accepted view. Let's turn to the other and look
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:28.800]   at the biblical view. This is the thing that the Bible teaches. This was the message that Paul
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:33.440]   taught. This is the thing that made him the man he was. This is a philosophy that sees not only
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:38.720]   through life, but through death and beyond, and he's ready whatever may come and satisfied. And
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:44.720]   he doesn't slink out saying, "I'm ready to depart." He sings, he exalts, he rejoices. He's
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:51.200]   more than conqueror, and he looks forward in a way that nobody else can. Now then, what is this?
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:58.240]   Well, it is as I've been trying to indicate to you, this great teaching of the apostle,
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.920]   the great teaching of the Bible everywhere. You notice how he did it in Lystra. There they were,
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.520]   they'd seen the miracle, they said, "This man must be a god. Let's worship him." And they were on
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:12.960]   the verge of doing so. "Papsus, Paul, sirs, I beseech you, don't behave in this foolish manner."
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.120]   He says, "You are doing this, of course, because you've been worshipping idols. You're afraid of
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.680]   life, you don't understand, so you've invented gods. You've made idols to try to give yourselves
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:25.440]   an explanation, and you're worshipping yourselves, though you don't know it. You think you're
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.000]   worshipping gods, but these are vanities, they're empty, there's nothing there. Listen," he says.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:38.720]   And he began to preach the living God to them. Wasn't that the very thing that he said?
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:45.760]   Well, this is the whole message of the whole Bible. Listen to these words of the great apostle there
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:51.360]   in Lystra. It's such a perfect summary of what the gospel has to say to this modern world of ours,
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:58.800]   at this very moment. "Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you,
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:04.080]   and preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities unto the living God,
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.640]   who made heaven and earth and the sea, and all things that are therein,
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.680]   and on ye goes to expound this living God." Well now, that's the biblical message.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:19.040]   What is this book called the Bible? Well, it's the great manual of the soul.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:24.480]   It's the textbook of life. Here's a book which rarely does answer your questions. How does it
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.840]   do so? Well, this is how it begins. It doesn't say, "Aren't you feeling well? Do you want healing?
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.160]   Are you feeling lonely? Do you want a friend? Do you want a bit of happiness and joy? Come along."
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:40.080]   No, that's cults. That's not Bible. This is Bible. You've got a problem. Have you? Well, listen.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:50.800]   "In the beginning, God." That's the Bible.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.400]   You see, the Bible never starts with men. It always starts with God.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:04.560]   And the whole trouble with the modern world is that it starts with men and ends with men,
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.720]   and so it ends in confusion and chaos.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.800]   And the essence of the biblical message is to say that there is no hope until the world stops
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:22.880]   and starts again and starts with God. Why? Well, because you can't understand the world at all
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:28.560]   itself. Leave alone men and the problems of the world and men until you've started with God.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:35.680]   Where's it come from? And the Bible says, "God, in the beginning, God created the heavens and the
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:45.280]   earth and the sea and all that in them is." Now, the Bible doesn't argue about the being
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:51.360]   and the existence of God. It declares it. It asserts it. I know that certain Christian
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.320]   philosophers down the ages have tried to bring forth proofs of God. It's all right. They're
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:00.400]   all right as far as they go. They're a great help to people who already believe in God,
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.800]   but they very rarely convince anybody else. But they're worth noting. I'm not going to go into
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:10.320]   them in detail. There are certain arguments. I've already given you one, the argument from nature,
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:15.600]   if you like, the design and the order and so on, cosmological argument.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:27.680]   But there are other arguments, the argument about the uncaused cause. Every effect has a cause,
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:33.280]   but that in turn is the effect of another cause. And back and back and back you go
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:40.320]   until you arrive at the uncaused cause. That's God. Or if you like, a kind of moral argument.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:47.520]   We recognize, all of us, that there is bad, good, better. But bad, good, better suggests
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:54.160]   best. Where is it? Not to be found in this world, not to be found in man. That's God,
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:00.240]   the ultimate, and so on. Now, these are the arguments. And the very fact that they've argued
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.400]   that you can think about him at all is a proof in and of itself in a strange way that he's there,
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:09.280]   the ontological argument. Don't worry about those. All I'm saying is this, that they are there,
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:14.160]   and you can use them if you like, but they're not enough. What is the ultimate proof? The ultimate
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:21.120]   proof is the revelation of God himself, proved by history. Now that's the case of the Bible.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:27.440]   God has said certain things about himself, and then in history he has proved that they're true.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.040]   That's the biblical case. Let me work it out for you, merely in outline, by putting it like this.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:38.320]   What is this book called the Bible? Well, you know, it's ultimately a book about God.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:44.240]   Ah, but you say, I thought it dealt with the human race, and with kings, and queens, and births,
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:49.280]   and marriages, and deaths, and wars. All right, you're perfectly right. But you see, all this
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:58.240]   under God. The Bible is a book about God. And it isn't a book that claims that as the result of a
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:03.760]   lot of meditation and research, it has arrived at a belief in God. That's the popular modern theory,
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.080]   which is pure theory. This evolutionary theory applied to the realm of the spiritual.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:15.680]   What these men say is this, that God spoke. They didn't say we arrived. God spoke.
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:23.280]   And then they tell us exactly what he told them. And what do they say? Well, this is what they say.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:36.000]   That God is a triune God. Dear me, says someone. Fancy saying that. On the last Sunday in April in
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:43.040]   1964, I came into your chapel tonight because I'm in trouble, and because I wanted a little bit of
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.600]   help. I wanted an answer to my question. I wanted you to solve my problem. And are you going to
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:53.280]   preach to me about the triune God? My dear sir, they said, don't you know where you're living?
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.480]   Don't you know what your world is like? We haven't the leisure today to sit back and indulge in this
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.240]   abstruse theology about the blessed Holy Trinity, haven't you?
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:07.120]   I'm in this pulpit primarily just to say this,
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:14.800]   that the only hope for this world at this moment is the fact that there is a triune God.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:24.960]   That this is not the only world, and that all we know about this world is not the whole truth.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:32.400]   Indeed, it's very little. Above it, beyond it, is the triune God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:37.440]   I'm going on subsequent Sunday evenings, God willing, to try to expound this great doctrine
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:42.080]   to you still further and in greater detail. I'm simply giving you a summary of it tonight.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:48.560]   But there, this is the fundamental statement of the Bible, this one God in Father,
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:54.160]   Son, and Holy Spirit. And he tells us something about himself.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:46:03.040]   He tells us that he is eternal, that he is from eternity to eternity, that he is glorious,
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:11.120]   which means that he is absolutely perfect, and so glorious and so perfect that we can't conceive
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:15.920]   of it. Glory is the ultimate attribute of God, and that is something ineffable,
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:23.280]   something that baffles description. He is also holy. God is holy. God is just. God is righteous.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:36.880]   God is power, omnipotent, all-powerful. He is wise. He knows everything. He is love. He is mercy.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:43.520]   He is compassion. These are the attributes of God that he has revealed himself. He's taught men
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:48.480]   these things. He's come to his servants, and he has said, "This is the message. Tell the people,
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:54.560]   'I am such and such a God,'" and he reveals himself and these glorious attributes.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:58.080]   But the one I'm particularly concerned about tonight, of course, is this,
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:07.840]   that he is a God who has a plan and a purpose. Did you notice how Paul puts it here to Timothy?
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:16.960]   Listen to this. He says, "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me,
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.760]   his prisoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:27.360]   power of God, who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works,
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:35.520]   but according to his own purpose, his own purpose, and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:42.400]   before the world began." Now, this is to me the whole secret of everything,
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:47.360]   that this universe of ours is not an accident, it's not the result of chance,
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:53.280]   it is something that has come into being as the result of the purpose and the plan of the triune
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:48:02.640]   God. God had a purpose and a plan before the world began. God in eternity decided, chose,
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:13.200]   elected, determined, decided to create a world. The world is not an accident. It is not the result
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:19.440]   of the interaction of blind fossils. It is something that has come into being as the result
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:29.120]   of a deliberate purpose and plan of the almighty God. So he decided to make and to create. In the
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   beginning, God created. There it is. Now, you remember how the apostle Paul argues about that
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:43.520]   very thing in the first chapter of the epistle to the Romans, in verses 18 and following. He says,
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:49.120]   "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men,
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:55.520]   who hold down the truth in unrighteousness. Because that which may be known of God is
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:00.720]   manifest in them, for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:09.520]   from the foundation of the world are clearly seen, even his eternal power and Godhead,
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:16.720]   so that they are without excuse." What he means is this. It's as if men only had eyes to see,
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:23.040]   they would see the marks of God and the proofs of God in what he has made. The invisible things,
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:29.120]   his power and his Godhead, his creator. It's there, if you can only see it, the marvel,
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   the wonder, the perfection, the balance. God, he made everything in the beginning. He started time.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:41.600]   He made a perfect world and the perfect men in it. He made angels, unseen spiritual persons.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:46.400]   He made the heavens and the earth, the animals. He made men, he made everything,
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:55.680]   and it was all good and perfect. Now you see, that's how the Bible leads you to face your
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:03.920]   particular problem. You start with this whole origin of the cosmos. Then you say to me, "Well,
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:08.480]   very well, that sounds very wonderful, you know, but it doesn't look like the world in which I find
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:14.320]   myself tonight. It isn't very perfect. I find everything which is imperfect. I find strife
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:19.520]   and envy and jealousy and war and bitterness and drunkenness and faithlessness. I find the
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:25.760]   world a chaos." And yet you say, "God made it perfect." Haven't you something to say at that
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   point? Oh, yes, indeed, I have. The Bible has a great deal to say. The Bible tells us, you know,
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.480]   that those angels which God created perfect and to whom he gave absolute free will,
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:41.840]   that some of them rebelled against God in their pride because they wanted to be God,
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:49.200]   and they fell, and that they've influenced the whole universe. That's the devil, that's the fall
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:57.760]   of men. You say, "Do you believe things like that in 1964?" My dear friend, 1964 is what drives me
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:03.840]   to believe in it. I don't see a world going upwards, I see a world going downwards. I don't
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:09.120]   understand life apart from the doctrine of the fall, the doctrine of evil, the doctrine of hell,
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:15.440]   the doctrine of the devil. It's all here in this book. It explains it. It isn't accident and chance.
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:23.040]   God made that world in that perfect manner, and it is as it is because of the devil and evil
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:29.520]   and his influence upon this world of ours. But—and again, let me say this is nothing
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:33.120]   but summarizing tonight. I've got to work these things out in detail, some of them.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:38.160]   The Bible goes on to say this, and this is where the hope comes in at this moment.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:45.680]   The world is as it is because of the devil, because of the fall. Is there any hope? Is there
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:51.200]   in philosophy? Is there in politics? Is there in an evolutionary process? It doesn't look like it
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:57.120]   does it. And there isn't, of course. The world goes round in circles, better, worse, better,
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.200]   worse, up and down. Look at your history, secularly, and there you'll see that this
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:06.480]   constant cycle, as if we're going to arrive and we never do, back we go, always a dark age,
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:10.800]   following an age of enlightenment, round and round in circles. Is there no hope? There is.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:16.800]   And here is the hope that the triune God is still interested in this world. That God didn't
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:22.000]   abandon it when men fell in his folly and listened to the devil and became the dupe of the devil.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:29.360]   God is still interested. The doctrine of deism, which means that God made the universe like a
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:34.000]   watchmaker making a clock and wound it up and then put it down and had nothing more to do with it,
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:42.720]   is absolutely wrong. God is not only transcendent, he is imminent and he is concerned and he's
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:48.480]   involved. Not only that, the whole story of the Bible is that God is still controlling.
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:55.680]   That far from abandoning this world, God is interested in it and is controlling it and
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:00.720]   he is acting upon it. He does so in his providence, but he does so in a still more definite manner.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:06.800]   There's a great phrase, you'll often find it in the Bible, "When the fullness of the times was
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:11.920]   come." What does it mean? Well, it means this, that God has got a purpose for this world.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:17.280]   The devil has tried to spoil it, but he's not going to succeed. He has succeeded temporarily.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:22.000]   God, in his infinite wisdom, has given him that liberty. I don't know why, don't ask me. I can't
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.640]   explain. That's the mind of God. But God has allowed evil, God has allowed the devil, he's
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:32.800]   allowed the fall, but he isn't going to allow it to go on. God is still interested. God is still
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:41.680]   concerned. God is still intervening. How do I know? I point you to the flood. I point you to a man
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:47.600]   called Abram who was living as a pagan in a place called Ur of the Chaldeans. And I point out to you
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:52.080]   how God went to that man and said, "Come out. I want to make a man of you. I want to make a nation
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:57.120]   of you. I want to make a people of you. I'm going to influence this whole world through you. I'm
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:05.840]   going to save it ultimately through you and your seed." Abram, God acting. That's what Abram said.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:10.960]   He didn't claim he'd had an idea. He said that God had visited him and had called him. And out
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:16.720]   of him came the Jews. And the whole story of the Jews is but a great revelation of God,
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:21.120]   his character, his power. Look at them. Look at their victories. How did they get them?
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:26.560]   Was it their military prowess? No, no. They always ascribe it to God. Then they get defeated. What's
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:32.880]   the matter? Oh, they'd forgotten God. Their whole history is to be understood in terms of God.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:38.560]   And again, bring in the whole question of prophecy. In other words, for me to conclude,
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:45.920]   nothing is more important for us as we try to understand the problems of life and solve them.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:55.280]   Then to recognize that there are two types of history. There is the history that God permits,
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:55:01.040]   and there is the history that God produces. There is the history of what man does in his folly and
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:05.920]   the trouble into which he gets himself. And there is the history of the intervention of God,
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:11.040]   of God acting through Israel, doing things to the nations that were against them. And ultimately,
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:16.960]   when the fullness of the times had come, sending this blessed person, Jesus Christ, our Savior,
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:23.200]   to whom Paul refers and to whom he tells Timothy to look, he sends him into this world. This is God,
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:29.920]   God's history. And according to this record, according to the message of this book,
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:36.720]   these two histories are going to go on until eventually they coalesce. And there will be an
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:42.160]   end to the world. It is not an accident. It didn't start as an accident. It won't end as an accident.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:46.800]   You know, the bombs are not going to end the world. I can tell you that now. I make a prophecy. I
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:52.640]   stake the whole of Christianity on this. The world is not going to end as the result of a hydrogen or
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:56:03.040]   an atomic bomb. God's going to end the world. And the world will not end until that day of which
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:09.840]   Paul speaks, "I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:20.480]   have committed unto him against." That day, the end. The God who started history will end history.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:27.920]   You can't get any particular benefit out of this gospel unless you believe the whole gospel
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.160]   about God, the Father, God, the Son, and God, the Holy Spirit.
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:43.440]   Of how they made the world and men and all, and how blessed be the name of God.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:51.440]   They are still interested, still concerned. I know of nothing that enables me to live tonight but
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:57:02.960]   this, that God so loved the world that he sent into it, he gave, and even to the death of the cross,
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:09.920]   his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:19.600]   but have everlasting life. God was in and through Christ reconciling the world.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:28.240]   Unto himself. It is in the light of that, your every problem is solved,
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:34.800]   your every question is answered. The vital question is, do you believe the gospel?
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:41.200]   Don't start with yourself. Start with yourself in the light of God, if you like. Start with God
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:47.520]   and see yourself under God and then believe the whole revelation.
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:54.720]   And you will find peace and rest for your soul.
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:58:00.400]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
