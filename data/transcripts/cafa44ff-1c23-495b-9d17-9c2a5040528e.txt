[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.620]   in the right direction.
[00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.820]   For this episode, I wanted to spend some time talking about Christ through the lens of the
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.140]   greater than Solomon.
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.140]   Christ through the lens of the greater than Solomon.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.820]   I stated in episode 1 that every now and then I will be taking portions of the scriptures
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.420]   and using these portions as the substantive material for the episode.
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.100]   My reasoning behind that is simple.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.740]   The scriptures are the crown jewel of all thought and life, or as it's stated in 2 Peter
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.020]   1.3, "For his divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness
[00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.180]   through the true knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and excellence."
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.780]   Depending on the episode, it will be because of the design of the previous episodes that
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.040]   makes it necessary and/or these portions of the scriptures have made a particularly indelible
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.860]   mark and/or I just very plainly find them particularly fascinating.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.140]   In this episode, I'm going to be reading large swaths of the scriptures.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.420]   You're going to have to wait a bit as I connect them together, but I assure you they indeed
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.820]   do connect together.
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:11.500]   The first two swaths come from Matthew 6 24-34 and Matthew 6 24-34 and Matthew 6 24-34 and
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.060]   Matthew 12 30-42.
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.780]   No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.980]   will be devoted to one and despise the other.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.580]   You cannot serve God and wealth.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.980]   For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.300]   what you will drink, not for your body, as to what you will put on.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.580]   Is life not more than food, and the body more than clothing?
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.020]   Look at the birds of the sky, that they do not sow nor reap nor gather crops into the
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.140]   barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.780]   Are you not much more important than they?
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.900]   And which of you by worrying can add a single day to his lifespan?
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.100]   And why are you worried about clothing?
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.060]   Notice how the lilies of the field grow.
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.660]   They do not labor, nor do they spin thread for cloth, yet I say to you that not even
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.340]   Solomon in all of his glory clothed himself like one of these.
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.140]   But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.600]   into the furnace, will he not much more clothe you, you of little faith?
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.940]   Do not worry then, saying, "Where are we to eat?" or "What are we to drink?" or "What
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.700]   are we to wear for clothing?"
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.220]   For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that you need
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.220]   all these things.
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.620]   But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.140]   So, do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.300]   Each day has enough trouble of its own.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.620]   Matthew 12, 30-42 says this, "The one who is not with me is against me, and the one
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.380]   who does not gather with me scatters.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.420]   Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.940]   the Spirit shall not be forgiven.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.860]   And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.820]   speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.560]   the age to come.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.740]   Either assume the tree to be good as well as its fruit good, or assume the tree to be
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.800]   bad as well as its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.380]   You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, express any good things?
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.500]   For the mouth speaks from that which fills the heart.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.420]   The good person brings out of his good treasure good things, and the evil person brings out
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.380]   of his evil treasure evil things.
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.020]   But I tell you that for every careless word that people speak, they will give an account
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.780]   of it on the day of judgment.
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.140]   For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.300]   Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, 'Teacher, we want to see a sign from
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.540]   you.'
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.340]   But he answered and said to them, 'An evil and adulterous generation craves a sign, and
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.180]   so no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.580]   For just as Jonah was in the stomach of the sea monster for three days and three nights,
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.580]   so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.540]   The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment, and will condemn
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.140]   it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.860]   And behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.040]   The queen of the south will rise up with this generation at the judgment, and will condemn
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.100]   it because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.740]   And behold, something greater than Solomon is here."
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.820]   In these two passages, the common theme you see here is the comparison to Solomon.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.500]   In the first passage, not even Solomon was comparable in all his glory to just the lilies
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.180]   of the field.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:53.980]   In the second passage I read to you, the inference and context is that not even Solomon's wisdom
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.600]   was comparable to the wisdom of Christ.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.380]   So you have glory and wisdom, you have wisdom and glory.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.100]   It would appear then that Solomon was the gold standard, and in fact he was, and the
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.700]   epitome of both of these given the way these passages are read.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.420]   Why else would Solomon be used as a standard bearer in the words of Christ?
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:26.460]   This is corroborated by what we see historically and what we see in the Old Testament Scriptures.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.300]   Up until that time and since the coming of Jesus Christ, nobody had exceeded Solomon's
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:39.420]   glory and nobody was even heard to have had such wisdom.
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.820]   In the first passage I read to you, Matthew 6, 24-34, Jesus is encouraging his hearers
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:50.500]   to do something remarkable and something that requires an incredible amount of trust.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.860]   He's telling his hearers not to worry.
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.300]   As he tells his hearers not to worry, Christ begins to rationalize why they should not
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.820]   worry by reeling examples that are clear and contemporaneous.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:13.100]   Christ not only gives examples, but employs bulletproof logic and reason to his argument.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.020]   Look at the birds of the air.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.940]   They are fed and they are fine.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:24.940]   You, being a human being, being made in the image of God, are more important than a bird.
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.940]   Birds are not made in the image of God.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:32.800]   So if the birds are taken care of and they are not made in the image of God, by science
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.540]   of necessary inference, you would also be taken care of.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.780]   That is bulletproof logic.
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.100]   Here's more bulletproof logic and reasoning.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:48.060]   He goes on to state, Christ goes on to state, "And even if you do worry, what does worrying
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.380]   do?
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.540]   Does it add to your life?
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.780]   The answer is a resounding no.
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.260]   It does nothing anyway.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.460]   Worrying doesn't do a thing.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.420]   So consider the lilies of the field.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.500]   You accept them to be beautiful, and objectively they are.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.500]   They are beautiful and they are glorious.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:15.020]   But even Solomon, in all of his glory, was not like one of these lilies.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:20.220]   And if there was one human being throughout history, not just in the history of Israel,
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.500]   but throughout the history of mankind up to that point, that would have shown as human
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.460]   majesty, it would have been Solomon.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:34.580]   Yet even Solomon, in terms of appearance, could not compare to a lily.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:42.100]   The lilies do nothing, yet are all the more glorious than Solomon with respect to outward
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.860]   appearance.
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:50.580]   If all of these things are indeed true, and they are, then does it stand to reason that
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:58.140]   we kill ourselves worrying about circumstances we cannot control anyway, and does not really
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.140]   add anything positive to our lives?"
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.500]   Again, bullet-proof logic.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:11.260]   In the second passage, Matthew 12, 30-42, Jesus has just implicitly called out the Pharisees
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.180]   for being bad fruit.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.300]   Challenged by this seeming new teacher who had crowds following him out of hunger and
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:22.620]   curiosity, the jealous Pharisees ask Jesus to prove who he says he is.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.220]   They ask him to perform a sign, but at their own whim.
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.820]   Jesus had already been performing many signs to verify who he was and had already fulfilled
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.380]   much of the prophecies concerning who the Messiah would be.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.180]   Jesus had already been preaching to the crowds as well.
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:44.520]   He had been spending his life exercising power and speaking truth, healing the masses physically,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.740]   but more importantly, spiritually.
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:52.780]   Concerning Jonah, since Jonah is explicitly alluded to here, Jonah was a reluctant prophet
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.660]   who had been begrudgingly sent to Nineveh.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.640]   He hated the Ninevites because of who they were and what they had done.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.380]   So when he gets there, his sermon to the people of Nineveh is merely the following, and that's
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.960]   in Jonah 3-4.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.420]   This is Jonah's sermon to the Ninevites, the reluctant prophet.
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.340]   "Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown."
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.400]   Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.380]   There's nothing else recorded except those words.
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:27.020]   Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:33.640]   And the Ninevites repented at that preaching.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:41.180]   So Jesus states that the Ninevites, who had repented when they were given much less, that
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:47.260]   there will be a time and a place in the future where the Ninevites, who had repented at the
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:53.940]   preaching of Jonah, will actually condemn the generation that saw and heard Jesus preach,
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.720]   but not repent.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:01.500]   In the same way, the queen of the south will rise up with that same generation, who heard
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:08.180]   and saw the preaching of Christ, and also condemn it because she acknowledged God via
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:14.180]   Solomon and Christ was much greater than Solomon.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:20.660]   What you have to understand here is that this isn't some imaginary pie in the sky, by and
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.660]   by.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:31.980]   Jesus is talking about an actual, future, real, definite event that will occur.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:38.900]   It will absolutely come to fruition.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:45.380]   The Ninevites that repented at Jonah's preaching, the queen of the south that acknowledged God
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:54.100]   because she saw Solomon, they will rebuke the generation that saw and heard Jesus' preaching,
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:12:00.860]   but not repent, because Jesus was so much greater than Jonah or Solomon.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:08.580]   Regarding the queen of the south and Solomon, I want to read to you 1 Kings 10 verses 1-10.
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.420]   1 Kings 10 verses 1-10.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.020]   Now when the queen of Sheba, that's the queen of the south, now when the queen of Sheba
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:20.460]   heard about the fame of Solomon in relation to the name of the Lord, she came to test
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.800]   him with riddles.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.380]   So she came to Jerusalem with a very large entourage, with camels carrying balsam oil,
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.100]   and a very large quantity of gold and precious stones.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.780]   When she came to Solomon, she spoke to him about everything that was in her heart.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:38.420]   And Solomon answered all her questions, nothing was concealed from the king, which he did
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.040]   not explain to her.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:44.220]   And the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.180]   and the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters in
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.980]   their attire, his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings which he offered at the house of
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.980]   the Lord.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:53.980]   She was breathless.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.140]   Then she said to the king, "It was a true story that I heard in my own land about your
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.260]   words and your wisdom.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.900]   But I did not believe the stories until I came and my own eyes saw it all.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.900]   And behold, the half of it was not reported to me.
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.220]   You have exceeded in wisdom and prosperity the report which I heard.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.700]   Blessed are your men, and blessed are the servants of yours who stand before you continually
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.380]   and hear your wisdom.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:24.000]   Blessed be the Lord your God who has delighted in you to put you on the throne of Israel,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.960]   because the Lord loves Israel forever.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.320]   He made you king to do justice and righteousness."
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:38.000]   Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold and a very large amount of balsam oil and
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.680]   precious stones.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:45.200]   Never again did such a large quantity of balsam oil come in as that which the Queen of Sheba
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.500]   gave King Solomon.
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:53.600]   The Queen of Sheba was most likely the Queen of Ethiopia or the Queen of Yemen.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.080]   Either kingdom would have been a relatively strong and influential kingdom.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:05.560]   Even an extremely powerful international female figure coming to test to see if this so-called
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.880]   new ruler is everything people have stated him to be.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.160]   Solomon during this time built a kingdom and in terms of sheer international power and
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:24.040]   influence was greater than any other kingdom this world had ever seen or has seen.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.640]   His wealth and his wisdom had reached legendary status.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.320]   During Solomon's own lifetime, the Queen of Sheba hearing about this decides to test
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:38.080]   for herself if all the reports people saying about him are true.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.400]   Is it perhaps one of those rumor mill stories that end up just getting exaggerated as more
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   people speak about him or are the rumors based on objective facts?
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.920]   When she sees for herself and tests Solomon for herself, not only is everything said about
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.280]   him true, Solomon far exceeds everything the Queen of Sheba had heard about him.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.920]   Notice also that she was keen in understanding that the wisdom Solomon had wasn't because
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:10.840]   he himself was inherently special, rather she gave God all the glory.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.000]   She stated that it was God who put Solomon on the throne of Israel because the Lord loves
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.500]   Israel forever.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:27.400]   It was apparent in Solomon's life that his wisdom and glory came supernaturally.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.040]   This echoes Matthew 5.16, let me read it to you, it says this.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:37.720]   Jesus says, "Your light must shine before people in such a way that they may see your
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.840]   good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven."
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.040]   We should do our works in a way that glorifies, who?
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   Us?
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.040]   No.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:57.320]   We should do it in a way that brings attention, even just a little bit to ourselves, no.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:03.920]   We should serve in such a way that glorifies our Father completely.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:11.760]   Where people understand the root and source of strength of our good works belongs to our
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.760]   Father.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:21.440]   Moreover, Solomon's kingdom was a model for justice and righteousness.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.700]   So picture this scenario.
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.640]   For the Jews, there was one central figure that they could relate to that showed the
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.080]   greatness of Israel politically and physically.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.760]   This was a greatness that would one day be again achieved because of the promises of
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.760]   God.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.400]   They were once again looking forward to a political and physical kingdom that would
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.360]   have Israel once again as a capital of the world.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.040]   This would be accomplished by the Messiah.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.960]   The Old Testament scriptures do indeed make that clear.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.320]   The Old Testament talks about the future Messiah.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:05.000]   Once again, restoring Israel to its proper place as the political capital of the world.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.080]   Indeed, Jerusalem is pictured as such.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:14.440]   So even after Jesus' resurrection, after the apostles had spent time with the risen
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.480]   Lord, they believed in the same.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:24.360]   Acts chapter 1, 6-8 states, "So when they had come together, they began asking Him,
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:30.600]   saying, 'Lord, is it at this time that You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?'
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.520]   And He said to them, 'It is not for you to know periods of time or appointed times
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.160]   which the Father has set by His own authority, but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:46.520]   has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria,
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.520]   and as far as the remotest part of the earth.'"
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.760]   Notice Jesus doesn't correct them about the restoration of Israel.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:18:02.720]   Rather, He says to them that it is not their place to know the exact timing of such restoration.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:12.520]   However, the Old Testament also talks very explicitly about the Messiah coming as a suffering
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:22.460]   servant who would be rejected by His own people, which we see very poignantly in Isaiah 53.
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:29.120]   It is within this context that Jesus comes on the scene, claiming to be that Messiah.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.900]   People are confused because if He is indeed the Messiah, then when is He going to set
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.700]   up the kingdom, politically?
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.760]   What they didn't understand was prior to setting up the kingdom, the Messiah would
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:50.040]   fulfill man's greatest need, and man's greatest need is the need for a Savior.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:56.600]   A Savior who could bring sinful man into a right posture with a holy God.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:02.760]   So as man looks on the outside, God cares about us so much more deeply, and cares for
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.840]   us on the inside.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:12.320]   People were looking at the long-promised and prophesied greatness of the Messiah, and as
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:19.520]   they were looking at the face of God, His goodness, His beauty, and His truth, they
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.800]   didn't recognize Him.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:28.280]   Isaiah 53, 1-6 states, "Who has believed our report?
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.360]   And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.320]   For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot and like a root out of dry ground.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.000]   He has no stately form or majesty that we would look at Him, nor an appearance that
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.440]   we would take pleasure in Him.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.600]   He was despised and abandoned by men, a man of great pain and familiar with sickness,
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.320]   and like one from whom people hide their faces, He was despised, and we had no regard for
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.320]   Him.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:58.940]   However, it was our sicknesses that He Himself bore, and our pains that He carried, yet we
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:04.120]   ourselves assumed that He had been afflicted, struck down by God, and humiliated.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:10.160]   And He was pierced for our offenses, He was crushed for our wrongdoings, the punishment
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:15.240]   for our well-being was laid upon Him, and by His wounds we are healed.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.840]   All of us like sheep have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way, but the Lord
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:28.800]   has caused the wrongdoing of us all to fall on Him."
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.960]   He was greater than Solomon in glory, but wasn't recognized.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.720]   He was greater than Solomon in wisdom, but wasn't recognized.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:46.160]   The question is now personal to every individual who has walked this earth.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.880]   Will you recognize Him?
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.120]   Do you recognize Him?
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.640]   Listen to what Zechariah says in Zechariah 14.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:03.920]   This is a passage that trips up many people, so listen to it in full.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:10.840]   Zechariah 14, "Behold, a day is coming for the Lord when the spoils taken from you will
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.880]   be divided among you.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.400]   For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.800]   taken, the houses plundered, the women raped, and half of the city exiled, but the rest
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.720]   of the people will not be eliminated from the city.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.800]   Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.200]   of battle.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:38.080]   On that day, His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.800]   on the east, and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west,
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.120]   forming a very large valley.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.800]   Half of the mountain will move toward the north, and the other half toward the south,
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.800]   and you will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.920]   to Azel, yes, you will flee just as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.920]   king of Judah.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.520]   Then the Lord, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.760]   On that day there will be no light, the luminaries will die out, for it will be a unique day
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.200]   which is known to the Lord, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at the
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.520]   time of evening there will be light.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.040]   And on that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:29.360]   sea and the other half toward the western sea, it will be in summer as well as in winter.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.080]   And the Lord will be king over all the earth, and on that day the Lord will be the only
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.440]   one and His name the only one.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:43.160]   All the land will change into a plain from Geba to Rimen south of Jerusalem, but Jerusalem
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:49.160]   will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin's gate as far as the place of the first gate
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.840]   to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king's winepresses.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.280]   People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will live
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.840]   in security.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.200]   Now this will be the plague with which the Lord will strike all the peoples who have
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.240]   gone to war against Jerusalem.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:11.080]   Their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets,
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.280]   and their tongue will rot in their mouth.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.240]   And it will come about on that day that a great panic from the Lord will fall on them,
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.360]   and they will seize one another's hand, and the hand of one will be raised against
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.920]   the hand of another.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.120]   Judah also will fight at Jerusalem, and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.600]   be gathered, gold, silver, and garments in great abundance.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.320]   And just like this plague, there will be a plague on the horse, the mule, the camel,
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.260]   and the donkey, and all the cattle that will be in those camps.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:44.440]   Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:49.400]   will go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of armies, and to celebrate
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.120]   the Feast of Booths.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.880]   And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.740]   worship the King, the Lord of armies, there will be no rain on them.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:04.080]   And if the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.080]   It will be the plague with which the Lord strikes the nations that do not go up to celebrate
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.880]   the Feast of Booths.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.160]   This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.400]   go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:23.960]   On that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "Holy to the Lord."
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.600]   And the cooking pots in the Lord's houses will be like the bowls before the altar.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.600]   Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the Lord of armies.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:38.320]   And all whose sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them, and there will no
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:46.760]   longer be a Canaanite in the house of the Lord of the armies on that day.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:54.280]   So the Messiah will come when there seems to be absolutely no hope for the nation of
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.080]   Israel.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:05.800]   The Messiah will literally touch down on the Mount of Olives with His Holy Ones.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:14.180]   The Messiah will physically touch down on the Mount of Olives with His Holy Ones.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:19.480]   They're going to touch down and take care of business.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:24.840]   It's interesting because it seems like the manner in which He comes parallels lightning.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:31.900]   It would seem like He comes at an extremely dark time, not only in terms of the context,
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.140]   but also celestially.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:42.860]   Then with a flash of bright light, He comes and He takes care of business.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:48.320]   After that, Jerusalem will once again be the capital of the world.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:53.680]   And the nations will be required to come and pay tribute.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.640]   And if you don't, there will be consequences.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:04.600]   This is what we know as the millennial kingdom of Christ.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.040]   This is the millennial kingdom of Christ.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:18.100]   Towards the end of the tribulation, as Israel is being devastated and ransacked, when there
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:27.760]   is absolutely seemingly no human hope, Christ will come after the luminaries, after the
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.720]   sky gives up its light.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.160]   And you're going to see His bright light.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:40.880]   He's going to physically touch down and it's going to cause a great, great shattering of
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.780]   the earth.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:53.640]   And He's going to appear with His Holy Ones, vanquish Israel by killing Israel's enemies.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:27:04.480]   And they will see Him as plain as day and they will know who their Messiah is.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.960]   I want to read to you Matthew 24 verses 1 through 28.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.100]   Jesus left the temple area and was going on His way when His disciples came up to point
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.400]   out the temple buildings to Him.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.920]   But He responded and said to them, "Do you not see all these things?
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.800]   Truly I say to you, not one stone here will be left upon another, which will not be torn
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.080]   down."
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:33.080]   And as He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately saying,
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.000]   "Tell us, when will these things happen?
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.200]   And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.040]   And Jesus answered and said to them, "See to it that no one misleads you, for many will
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.240]   come in My name saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will mislead many people.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.940]   And you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:56.460]   See that you are not alarmed, for those things must take place.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.880]   But that is not yet the end, for nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.820]   and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.120]   But these things are merely the beginning of birth pains.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:11.540]   Then they will hand you over to the tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.920]   nations because of My name.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.280]   And at that time many will fall away, and they will betray one another and hate one
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.880]   another, and many false prophets will rise up and mislead many people.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.200]   And because lawlessness is increased, most people's love will become cold.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.160]   But the one who endures to the end is the one who will be saved.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.960]   The gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.080]   nations, and then the end will come."
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.200]   Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation which was spoken of through Daniel
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.880]   the prophet, standing in the holy place, let the reader understand that those who are on
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.040]   Judaea must flee to the mountains.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.000]   Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the things out of his house, and whoever
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.640]   is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.000]   But woe to those women who are pregnant, and to those who are nursing babies in those days!
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.280]   Moreover, pray that when you flee it will not be in the winter or on a Sabbath, for
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.800]   there will be a great tribulation as such has not occurred since the beginning of the
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.720]   world until now nor ever will again.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.560]   And if those days had not been cut short, no life would have been saved; but for the
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.040]   sake of the elect, those days will be cut short.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.800]   Then if anyone says to you, "Behold, here is the Christ," or "He is over here,"
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:25.920]   do not believe him; for false Christs and false prophets will arise and will provide
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.040]   great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:35.720]   Behold, I have told you in advance, so if they say to you, "Behold, he is in the wilderness,"
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:41.080]   do not go out; or "Behold, he is in the inner rooms," do not believe them; for just
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:49.800]   as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.120]   of the Son of Man.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:58.760]   Wherever the corpse is there the vultures will gather.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:07.960]   Jesus is here looking at the very place he will touch down upon in the future.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:14.920]   And he is telling his disciples about a future event that is to occur.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.920]   His coming is real.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:22.960]   His second coming is an absolutely real and certain event.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:29.000]   And let me tell you, even if we never see it in our lifetime, we all die.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.480]   The death rate for all human beings is one hundred percent.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.260]   Nobody has survived death itself.
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:40.520]   We will all see the Lord one way or another.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:45.520]   You are not Enoch and you are certainly not Elijah.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.860]   The question is, do you recognize him?
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.240]   Do you recognize him?
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:31:04.080]   Or will you be someone who should have recognized him, only to be condemned by those who did?
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.880]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:10.940]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:15.320]   To him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion, James Hongel.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:22.320]   God bless you.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:37.320]   God bless you.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.320]   God bless you.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.320]   God bless you.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   God bless you.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   God bless you.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.480]   (upbeat music)
