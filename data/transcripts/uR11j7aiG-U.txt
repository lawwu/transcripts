[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:10.040]   Okay, so now we've done a great job budgeting,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.960]   we've done a great job saving,
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.120]   we have money sitting in a retirement account,
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.920]   what do we do with it?
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.760]   We're gonna buy something with it later on down the road,
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.560]   maybe we know what we're gonna buy,
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.040]   but we're not gonna buy it yet,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.360]   so we need to invest our money for the future.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.320]   And that's the next segment.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.640]   It's gonna be three sessions.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.360]   Alan Roth will come up and talk first
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.120]   about the language of investing,
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.320]   and then I'll come up for a while
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.440]   and then Alan will come back.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.080]   So Alan is the founder of WealthLogic LLC,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.760]   an hourly-based financial planning
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.160]   and investment advisory firm.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.520]   He's also the author of a bestselling book,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.320]   "How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street,"
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.600]   and he writes for several leading publications.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.760]   Maybe you've read him in AARP or other places.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.240]   Alan has served as a corporate finance officer
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.440]   at two multi-billion dollar companies
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.120]   and consulted with many others while at McKinsey & Company.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.520]   He holds a Bachelor of Science
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.200]   from the University of Chicago
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.040]   and MBA from Northwestern University.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.080]   He's a graduate of the executive program
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.160]   at Stanford University.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.120]   He's a licensed CPA and CFA,
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.800]   oh, excuse me, CFP.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.720]   Excuse me, Alan, sorry about that.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.040]   And despite his credentials,
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.400]   he still claims that he can invest simply.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.360]   So Alan, come on up.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.520]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.880]   - Rick, that's University of Colorado,
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.600]   not University of Chicago.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.000]   - Oh, is that what I said there?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.160]   Did I say that wrong?
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.000]   - I had to say that.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.080]   - Well, I was trying to give you a little bit more, you know.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.800]   - But I'll support you in something.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.560]   One of the ahas I had in my practice
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.960]   is clients would come to me.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   Some would be really optimistic.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.400]   I can retire soon, right?
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.640]   Others are, I'll never be able to retire.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.480]   Which ones do you think had saved far more money?
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.760]   The pessimists, the ones that were afraid
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.400]   of living under a bridge.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.040]   And SC, I'm older than you.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.240]   Guess how much I made in my first job?
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.080]   $15,100 a year.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.920]   And I knew I couldn't spend that amount, and I didn't.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.360]   You know, Roth is right.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.000]   Investing is simple.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.240]   If you want it, just get the market return.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.960]   But we here at Infinity Wealth can do much better.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.920]   By analyzing fundamental indicators
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.040]   such as P/E ratios, EBITDA,
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.160]   dividend yields alongside technical tools
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.040]   like moving averages and MACD,
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   we seek to identify undervalued assets and entry points.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.720]   I'll use other big words like
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.680]   understanding the nuances of the market,
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.240]   economic indicators, GDP growth rate,
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.120]   interest rate fluctuations,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.240]   anticipate macroeconomic shifts
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.240]   while maximizing alpha and managing beta exposure.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.960]   My goal is to teach you what this means.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.360]   Anyone know what this means?
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.440]   - You're about to get a big bill.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.320]   - You're about to get a really big bill.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.240]   Well, you won't see the bill
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.560]   because I'll just take it 1% of assets.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560]   You won't actually see it.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.720]   It won't cause any pain.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.720]   So what I'm trying to do is,
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.800]   Infinity Wealth impress you with our expertise,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.240]   but it's financial jargon that has been proven
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.960]   not to work for investors.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.800]   You'll be impressed and hopefully intimidated.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.240]   So you'll hand your money over to me
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.880]   that you've worked so hard for,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   and I can buy a bigger yacht.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.040]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.840]   I chose hourly because yachts aren't really big in Colorado.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.600]   We don't even have big lakes.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.680]   All right.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.080]   A question I ask every prospective client.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.640]   They have to fill out a questionnaire
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.440]   before I'll have the talk with them.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.200]   Guess which of the four I'm least likely to take?
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.920]   The sophisticated.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.440]   It takes far too much time to teach them
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.320]   that they don't know what they think they know.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.400]   So if you guys are beginners,
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.920]   you have a huge advantage of some of the people
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.760]   in that room.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.000]   So I'm just gonna cover some basic.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.160]   What's a stock?
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.960]   You're part owner of a corporation.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.760]   You've got upside and downside.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.000]   You hope to make money from dividends paid,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   and the stock goes up.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.200]   What's more important, by the way,
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.280]   dividend return or total return?
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.960]   Total return.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.400]   So you may get lucky.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.080]   You may buy Nvidia.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.880]   You may get unlucky, Pacific Gas and Electric.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.440]   By the way, trick question.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.080]   What earns more, stocks or bonds?
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.160]   96% of stocks earn the average of bonds.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.400]   It's the 4% of stocks,
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.320]   and lately it's been more like 0.1% of stocks
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.880]   that drive the entire market return.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.640]   So types of stocks, you can slice and dice them
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.440]   any way you want.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.920]   There are US and international stocks.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.600]   Now Nvidia does business overseas.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.400]   Nestle, based in Switzerland, does business here.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.560]   So the definition is where is it headquartered?
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.520]   You've got value, core, and growth.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.480]   Growth are those high-flying companies.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.480]   Nvidia, value are those that are struggling, like Ford,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.280]   not growing rapidly.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.720]   And you've got large, mid, and small.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.120]   Market capitalization, are they the most valuable companies?
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.920]   And by the way, is it the most valuable company
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.520]   has the highest stock price?
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.360]   It's the stock price
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.480]   times the number of shares outstanding.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.120]   What's worth more?
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.040]   $25 bills or $520 bills?
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.760]   The same.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.680]   What's a bond?
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.160]   A bond is you're merely lending money
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.880]   to a government, a corporation.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.400]   They're gonna pay you back your principal
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.200]   if they don't go out of business.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.200]   And by the way, the Vanguard Total Bond Index Fund
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.240]   follows the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.400]   It used to be called
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.760]   the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.920]   until Lehman Brothers went under.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.760]   And see, I'm so old that I remember the statement as a kid,
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.480]   "So goes General Motors, goes America."
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.040]   Buying GM stock is every bit as safe.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.600]   Buying GM bonds wasn't as safe.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.440]   Bond holders got back 5 cents on the dollar.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.560]   So you have, if the company does incredibly well
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.280]   like NVIDIA or just does okay,
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.360]   you've got no upside,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.880]   you just get paid back your principal and interest.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.840]   Now, one of the few terms
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.080]   that my industry has gotten right
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.680]   is something called junk bonds.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.900]   Those are bonds from risky corporations.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.920]   And my advice is take your risk with stocks
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.800]   and have your bonds
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.820]   be the most boring part of your portfolio.
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.900]   Bulls and bears.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.760]   We had the cutest bear that lived behind our house.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.880]   But bulls are better.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.120]   Bulls mean the market is generally up over 20%.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.920]   Bears, not so much.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.600]   When's a better time to buy, bull or a bear market?
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.320]   Bear, I'll show you that in my next presentation.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.860]   What's a mutual fund?
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.640]   A mutual fund is an investment vehicle
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.360]   that pools money from multiple investors
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.320]   and buys a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.680]   It's priced only once a day.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.940]   What's riskier, one stock or thousands of stocks?
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.440]   Are thousands of stocks still risky?
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.280]   An exchange-traded fund, ETF.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.240]   Very similar to a mutual fund,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.040]   but it trades throughout the day.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.520]   It can be far more tax-efficient,
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:17.480]   but it's typically more tax-efficient and lower expenses
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.540]   even for Vanguard.
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.800]   For Vanguard, however, many ETFs
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.060]   are just different share classes of their mutual funds.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.500]   And the Vanguard index funds,
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.060]   whether they're mutual funds or ETFs,
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.640]   are very tax-efficient.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:42.740]   Active management, finding undervalued securities
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.300]   like infinity wealth claims.
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.640]   Timing the market.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.500]   Passive management,
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.460]   no attempt to find undervalued securities,
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.780]   no attempt to time the market.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.780]   I'm a market timer.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.940]   I'm gonna show you in my next presentation.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.280]   And holding an efficient portfolio.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.200]   Anyone know the definition of an efficient portfolio?
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.900]   Owning every stock.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:15.660]   You diversify as much as you can by owning every stock.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.960]   So the three passive funds that I taught my son to invest
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.600]   when he was eight years old,
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.580]   hence the book "How a Second Grader Beat Wall Street",
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.580]   total stock index fund owns as close to as possible
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:41.380]   over almost 3,700 companies based in the United States.
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.700]   Very low cost.
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.700]   Total international owns roughly 8,700 companies.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.200]   And total bond tries to replicate.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.020]   There are so many bonds out there.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.980]   Even though this particular fund
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.000]   owns almost 18,000 individual bonds,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.640]   it's still sampling of all US investment grade,
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.700]   like Lehman Brothers and GM.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.260]   But it's roughly 2/3 backed by the US government,
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.060]   either treasuries or US government agencies.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:19.020]   And all of these have very low expense ratios.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   And all were introduced by someone
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.100]   I would call my hero, John Bogle.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.980]   Power of compounding.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.500]   I'm gonna also show you the tyranny of compounding
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.180]   in my next presentation.
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:46.140]   But $1,000 today,
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.080]   if it grows by 7.2%,
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.080]   the rule of 72, by the way, is just an easier way.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.960]   And it's an approximation that can be wrong.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.500]   But if you take 72 divided by a 7.2% return,
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.020]   which is how I picked it,
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.020]   it doubles every 10 years.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.340]   And you can see how fast it grows.
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.700]   In my book, I noted that Albert Einstein
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.260]   called the power of compounding
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.420]   the most powerful force in the universe.
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.260]   But that was probably myth, by the way,
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.860]   Jason Zweig taught me,
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.200]   that why would a mathematician think
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.540]   that it was any more than an exponent formula.
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.180]   But nonetheless, by budgeting,
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.060]   by putting money away and letting it grow
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.860]   and not make my industry rich,
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.940]   and betting on capitalism,
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.220]   I'm gonna go through a case study
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.700]   in the next presentation
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.880]   of one guy that really got it wrong.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.880]   So where to find definitions?
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:54.120]   Investopedia.com, I found, is very good.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.120]   To my surprise, and I haven't tested it
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.840]   for every term, but ChatGPT is pretty darn good.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.720]   And by the way, I've got the title
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.120]   to Jason Zweig's book wrong.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.440]   It's The Devil's Financial Dictionary.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.200]   If you go in and look at some of the terms
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.320]   in my first slide,
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.120]   and look at his book in that dictionary,
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.000]   you'll see what baloney it really is.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.320]   So I say that investing is simple.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.280]   If you can't explain your investments
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.680]   and your investment strategy,
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.460]   maybe not the tax part of it,
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:39.680]   to any eight-year-old, without jargon,
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.400]   you're probably doing it wrong.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.000]   But if you can't explain your investment strategy,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.760]   maybe not the tax part of it,
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.680]   to any eight-year-old, without jargon,
