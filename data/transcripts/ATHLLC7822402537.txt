[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.220]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.520]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.120]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.320]   I'm Chris Hutchins and I'm your host, and I'm excited you're here today.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.720]   And if you're listening to this podcast right now, you probably love to travel
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.120]   and you don't need me to tell you how great an experience it is, but I'm going
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.560]   to keep doing it anyways, and so is our guest today, Sebastian Modak.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.000]   He's a writer and a multimedia journalist based in New York, but he grew up all
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.120]   over the world and has since traveled to even more destinations.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.800]   In fact, if you know that amazing New York Times 52 places list that comes out
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.520]   each year, well, in 2019, Sebastian sent his entire year going to all 52 places.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.640]   Well, except one, but we'll get to that later.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.800]   He's now the editor-in-large at Lonely Planet and still writes about travel for
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.880]   publications like the New York Times, Conde Nast Traveler, and more.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.960]   We're going to talk about what he's learned from living in four different
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.480]   continents, traveling to 80 plus countries, what he thinks it means to travel like a
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.880]   journalist, and how he uses those skills to plan a memorable trip.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.840]   Some of the unusual experiences he's had on his journeys, why he thinks
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.840]   travel is important for everyone.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.040]   And finally, we're both going to share some of our favorite places to give you
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   some inspiration for your next adventure.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.120]   So, there's a lot to cover.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.040]   Let's get started.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.560]   Sebastian, welcome to the show.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.080]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.920]   I'm happy to be here.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.720]   So, you've probably spent more time traveling than almost anyone listening.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.800]   So, I'm curious just to kick us off what you think most people are probably
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.600]   getting wrong and not that it's wrong, but like what could people be doing
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.800]   totally differently in the way they travel?
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.520]   I think it starts before you even get on a plane or before you travel.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.400]   And I think what's missing a lot of the times, myself included in the past, and
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.920]   that's something I've been trying to be more conscious of going forward, is the
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.080]   why of travel, I think we've nailed the what, we've even nailed the how.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.320]   You want to go somewhere because your friend has told you about it and it's
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.080]   great, whatever, but are you really thinking deeply about how you're going
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.360]   to engage with the place when you're on the ground?
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.280]   Is this really just a bragging rights trip?
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.960]   Is this because you saw an oversaturated photo on Instagram and
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.160]   you want to get the same photo?
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.720]   Maybe that is the way that you start getting interest in a place and you
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.280]   start getting the idea of traveling.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.920]   But if that's the be all and end all, you're kind of missing the point.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.280]   And especially now, I think when you have to measure your travel decisions
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.880]   against things like your carbon footprint, and the public health issues
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.560]   that now surround travel with COVID and everything else, you have all these
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.440]   other things to balance and measure out.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.240]   Now, more than ever, I think you need to be like, "Okay, why am I really going
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.600]   on this trip, and how am I going to act once I hit the ground?"
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.240]   And I think that's really where people need to start more versus
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.400]   like, "Where am I going to go?"
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.960]   It's "Why am I going to go?"
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.000]   And then taking it from there.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.240]   I think that's when you really start building a rewarding trip that's going
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.280]   to give you these rewarding experiences that are going to last a lifetime.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.440]   What are some examples of good "whys" you've heard from people about why
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.720]   they're traveling or why they're going to a specific place?
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.800]   You know, from solo travelers, for example, the "why" might be they want
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.560]   to make some new friends and they want to go to a place where they can really
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.760]   interact with people and meet locals and learn.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.640]   I think that's a great example of getting the right "why".
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.800]   And I've known many people who have asked me that question, starting with like,
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.640]   "Where should I go if I want to really immerse myself in a place and immerse
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.640]   myself in maybe it's a language, maybe it's a cuisine, maybe it's a music
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.680]   scene or whatever else?"
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.360]   And that being a "why" I think is going to just immediately lead to serendipitous,
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.800]   life-changing encounters that we all really hope to have traveling.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.760]   You know, I can give you an example of a trip that I'm in the middle of
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.240]   planning right now. I got married recently and we're having our honeymoon.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.000]   And in thinking about our honeymoon, we started with a "why".
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.880]   We didn't start with a "where".
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.000]   We didn't start with, "Oh, we need to go to the Amalfi Coast or Hawaii or
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.520]   whatever else." And there's nothing wrong with those.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.680]   Those are popular honeymoon destinations for a reason.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.000]   But we were like, "Okay, we want to go somewhere where we can do something
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.720]   active, something outdoors, not push ourselves too hard, not have to overplan
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.360]   it because we still do want it to be a honeymoon where we can relax and enjoy
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.480]   each other's company, but also maybe experience something new."
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.560]   And that brought us to Slovenia and this incredible network of bike routes
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.280]   that Slovenia has put out over the last couple of years.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.920]   And so I poured over those and then I found one that's like this gourmet
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.040]   focused route where you're like stopping in restaurants and you're riding
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.960]   through wine country and you're really learning about the local cuisine and
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.560]   you're staying at certified, sustainable hotels and guest houses and you're
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.400]   doing it all on a bike.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.680]   So you're sustainable in that way.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.480]   And it was just all of a sudden, it's just opened up this trip that I had no
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.720]   idea even existed.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.040]   And even as a travel journalist, I didn't know it was possible.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.440]   And it all started with us just being like, "Where can we go that's like a
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.400]   little unexpected, but is also going to challenge us a bit, but isn't going to
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.760]   be like grueling 70 miles days on a bike, but it's going to be like 20 to 30 mile
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.920]   days instead and we'll end with a glass of wine and a good meal and a nice bed
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.800]   and breakfast." And we landed on Slovenia.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.920]   That's just one example of starting with the "What am I looking for?" and then
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.160]   going to the place instead of being like, "Man, everyone's been to Italy, but
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.680]   me, I need to go to Italy immediately."
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.520]   I've heard amazing things about Slovenia and haven't been.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.600]   So I want to get the recap when you're back.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.280]   But for sure, there's not like an obvious filter, right?
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.520]   If you want to search for a hotel, you're like, "Well, I want it to be four
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.280]   stars. I want it to have a pool.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   I want it to be within this distance of the city center." But when you took those
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.000]   criteria and you're like, "I would love to have a glass of wine at the end of the
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.600]   day, do something active." How did you end up to Slovenia?
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.720]   Maybe it's the wealth of knowledge you've built, but how would the average
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.760]   person take this idea of a why and an experience they want and actually arrive
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.440]   at a place?
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.120]   So there's something, not to do the whole corporate plug, but there's something we
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.000]   talk about at Lonely Planet a lot in terms of giving guidance to people, which
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.160]   is the bread and butter of what something like Lonely Planet does is travel
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:32.000]   guidance, is that you want to be their most knowledgeable friend, right?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.520]   You don't want to be necessarily just like, "We're an authority.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.040]   We're going to tell you what to do." You want to be that friend who's like, "Oh,
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.560]   what are you into?
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.760]   Oh, you got to try this and this and this because I totally know that you're into
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.440]   this and so you're going to really enjoy this." And so for me, I'm lucky to have
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.720]   this very extended network of travel writers and travel creators and all this
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.440]   stuff. So for me, those were my friends.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.880]   And I started just asking around.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.760]   I would see the articles that were coming through the pipeline at Lonely Planet.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.280]   I would see some people writing about cycling in Slovenia.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.840]   That would make me go down some rabbit hole of all these different green routes.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.760]   The kind of research that I think most travelers enjoy is that kind of research
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.760]   where you get like a little tip and you follow that down a rabbit hole and you're
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.480]   like, "Oh, okay. So maybe not." You know, like it brought me down a rabbit hole
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.880]   looking at like Provence and Bordeaux and all this stuff.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.280]   And I was like, "Oh, that's maybe just a little too crowded for what we want.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.400]   We want to have more space.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.000]   We want to feel like we're more embedded in local life." So we started looking at
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.640]   cases like, "Okay, if not France, if not Italy, just look at a map." Like, "Okay,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.240]   Slovenia is right there. What's going on in Slovenia?" So it's really just this
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.280]   like endless game, this kind of scavenger hunt where you're taking on little tips,
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.600]   you're doing your own research and you're landing on something that feels right.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.520]   But at least you've started somewhere beyond just like a bucket list.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.160]   We're going to come back to bucket lists because we had a fun conversation about
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:47.160]   that before. I'm curious, is there like a Lonely Planet or another source of like
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.440]   the world guidebook or a page or so about each country where you just start to like
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.880]   wet your palate on different places? Or I know Lonely Planet, I don't know if you
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.360]   still do, but they used to have this thorn tree forum online where you could go
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.360]   ask questions. Anything in that realm of kind of broader inspiration?
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.720]   Yeah, there is actually a Lonely Planet worldbook. I actually don't know the last
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.080]   time we put it out, but I've seen it before. It's this huge, thick doorstopper
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.720]   of a volume that's just like an overview of the world. I wouldn't necessarily
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.280]   recommend that. It's a big read to start going through. For better or for worse, I
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.440]   do think social media is a huge part of it. And it takes a little bit of your own
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.920]   work to filter through all the BS, so to speak, and the surface level stuff and the
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.800]   oversaturated photos and the influencer shots on the beach that aren't really
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.240]   telling you anything about the place. But once you get past that, you can find
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.720]   some really incredible information on social media. Just regular people out and
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.800]   about who put a Slovenia hashtag on something or maybe not. Maybe they put a
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.080]   bike touring hashtag and you're looking at the bike touring hashtag because
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.040]   you're interested in doing something with bikes. And you're like, "Where is this?
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.120]   There's this person drinking a glass of wine looking at this beautiful valley
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.680]   with a bike in the background. Oh, it's Slovenia, huh? Really?" So I think searching
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:04.320]   subject areas in social media is the digital equivalent of hanging out at a
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.880]   bar with the entire world and asking for recommendations. And it means you
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.920]   got to comb through some garbage to get to the good stuff. But it's in there and
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.800]   it's the really genuine, from the heart, personal stuff that when you get to
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.000]   those recommendations, I think they mean a lot. I do it even as a journalist. If
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.360]   I'm interested in seeing where people are bike touring or where people are
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.480]   backpacking or hiking, I'll search those hashtags. I'll follow those accounts on
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.240]   TikTok and Instagram or whatever and just see where people are hanging out
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.720]   and what people are talking about. Because for better or for worse, it is a
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.520]   pulse and you're looking for a pulse and you're looking for a trend and it's
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.440]   there. So I think that's one way. What I like to do is, yeah, starting with a
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.480]   continent. Maybe you're like, "Okay, Europe. I want to do a trip in Europe." But maybe
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.680]   I'm thinking beyond Spain, Italy, France. Just look at a map and pick a country
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.080]   and be like, "Oh, Albania. What's going on in Albania?" And then you can start
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.560]   looking there and maybe something's gonna interest you. Maybe it won't. Maybe
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.200]   you'll be like, "Okay, this looks a little too rough for me. I need something with
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.680]   more infrastructure." And then you look west and you're like, "Okay, maybe Croatia.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.320]   Maybe Slovenia. Maybe Czech Republic." And just like looking at a physical map and
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.520]   dreaming about it a little bit. And we'll probably get to this later. But I am of
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.100]   the firm belief that everywhere, literally everywhere, has something to
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.560]   offer if you open yourself up to it. It has something that's gonna blow your
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.360]   mind. If you spend a little time, if you approach it with an open mind, you'll
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.600]   find something that's gonna blow your mind. Even in your own backyard. I live
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.640]   2 blocks from Prospect Park in Brooklyn. If I go into Prospect Park today with
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.880]   the mindset that I'm looking to be educated, I'm looking to learn, I'm
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.880]   looking to have my mind expanded, I'm gonna have some interaction whether it's
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.240]   staring at a cardinal for 20 minutes or watching a couple hanging out on the
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.080]   lawn or playing with a random dog. That's gonna make me feel good and
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.560]   make me feel fulfilled. And I really firmly believe that it really starts
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.880]   with mindset, which loops all back to that idea of like, "Why are you traveling?"
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.080]   And if you go in with the right mindset, honestly, it doesn't really matter where
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.880]   you're going. You're gonna have your mind blown in some way.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.080]   So, I want to dig into that process. But before, I want to mention... Well, I don't
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.520]   know if the average listener is thinking of Reddit as social media. I want to plug
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.760]   it because I use it a lot for travel. And I just did one quick search and I said
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.400]   "European wine tour site colon reddit.com". And it's like "Crowdsourcing my wine
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.680]   tasting trip to Europe. Who's got suggestions?" There aren't a lot of
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.840]   comments, unfortunately. But the person who wrote it came up with all these
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.200]   suggestions that include Slovenia and Croatia and Alto Adige, which I don't
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.240]   even know where that is.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.360]   Alto Adige. Yeah. It's like Northern Italy, I think. Yeah.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.400]   So this at least had a bunch of suggestions, even though there weren't a
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.480]   lot of comments. So I use that a lot.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.000]   I do too. And actually, it's a great example. During the pandemic, I feel like
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.800]   you're going to end this podcast being like "This guy's obsessed with bikes.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.360]   Shut up about bikes." But I went down a serious rabbit hole with cycling,
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.200]   especially bike travel. I'm not really interested in the head-to-toe Lycra
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.280]   racing stuff. I love traveling by bike because I think it slows you down. You
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.800]   really get to notice a lot. It's just a great way to get the feel of the place.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.240]   But I really went down a rabbit hole during the pandemic because I was stuck
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.000]   at home like everyone else. I live in New York City. I don't own a car. So I was
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.920]   looking at ways to tap into this idea of adventure and travel while still being
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.600]   close to home and doing it with the tools that I had, which was a bicycle.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.240]   And Reddit was like a goldmine for that kind of stuff.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.960]   Just as an example, I remember finding someone talking about the "route verte",
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.440]   butchering that French, but it means the green route. And it's a network of
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.640]   trails and routes in Quebec, in Canada. I never would have thought of it. My
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.360]   knowledge and desire and understanding of Quebec starts and ends with Montreal,
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.960]   like it has for a long time. And then suddenly reading about this network of
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.120]   hundreds and hundreds of miles of trails that exist in Quebec, I started talking
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.280]   to my partner and we're like, "I hear the border is about to reopen with Canada.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.320]   What if we just went and did this trip that I saw on Reddit?"
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.080]   And we're like, "Okay, we don't have a car. But what if we took the train with
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.080]   our bikes as far north as it goes, and then got on our bikes from there and rode
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.520]   across the border into Canada and did the trip that way?" Which is exactly what we
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.760]   ended up doing. We took the train to St. Albans, Vermont, literally spent the
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.280]   night in Vermont, left that morning, rode to Canada, and then spent a week riding
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.560]   around Quebec, and then rode back to Vermont and took the train home, all
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.520]   without ever getting in the car. I wrote about it on Lonely Planet's website,
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.720]   actually. But it's a great example of something that just started with a tiny
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.000]   little spark of being like, "Huh, the green route, Quebec? Sounds kind of
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.520]   magical. I wonder if we could do it." Next thing I know, a few weeks later,
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.520]   we're on a train with our bikes on our way up to Canada. That just goes to show
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.720]   how the germ of something, if you have the right curiosity and the right
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.600]   mindset, can turn into a really great adventure.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.440]   There's two things to take away there that you didn't mention. One, I imagine
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.840]   that was a pretty inexpensive trip. You describe it in a way that people talk
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.440]   about these once-in-a-lifetime adventures that they plan for years and years, and
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.640]   they spend thousands of dollars. That doesn't sound like something that took a
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.080]   lot of advance notice or a lot of money to make happen.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.560]   We didn't know where we were staying every night. It was one of those kinds of
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.840]   trips. And it was amazing because you could do that in a place like Quebec. We'd
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.880]   be like, "Oh, we're starting to get a little tired. We've been riding for 60
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.080]   miles. It looks like a storm's coming in." Pull out my phone and be like, "What's
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.480]   the nearest bed and breakfast?" Give them a call. They're like, "Yeah, of course.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.120]   Come on through. Next thing you know, we're staying there." And I think that's
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.520]   a great point that you make. This is actually the point that I make in my
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:25.040]   story too, where you think of the capital B, capital T, big trip as something that
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.960]   you spend years thinking about, planning every moment. You're going to go on a
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.360]   safari. You're going to go climb to Everest Base Camp. You're going to do
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.280]   these huge things, which is great. Those have a place and those big goals are
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.760]   important. But what this taught me, at least, was that a big trip can come from
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:47.120]   a small idea. A big trip can be something that is largely improvised. It can be
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.360]   serendipitous. It can be spontaneous. Again, I really do think it comes down to
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.560]   mindset. I think we could have gone into that panicking about not having a place
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.960]   to stay, tired. We got rained on. We had flat tires, all this stuff. But because
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.600]   we had the attitude where we're like, "This is an adventure. What? We've been
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.400]   cooped up at home for a year and a half because of the pandemic, and now we're
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.920]   out here doing this amazing thing. How lucky are we?" Because we came in with
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.000]   that attitude, it just turned into a really fulfilling, if exhausting,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.480]   adventure.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.320]   It was in your backyard, per se. It wasn't directly there, but you took a train. You
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.120]   didn't have to cross an ocean. You didn't have to spend thousands on plane
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.800]   tickets. I think a lot of times, everyone plans vacations like, "Gosh, where can I
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.240]   go that's halfway around the world?" It's cool to hear that if you just think
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.720]   about it, you might find something not too far away.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.840]   Absolutely.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.760]   When we first spoke a few months ago, you said, "I think people should think
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.520]   about how to approach a trip like a journalist might. About the people you'll
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.120]   meet, how to approach it with an open mind." So we talked about mindset. We
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.400]   talked about the feeling you want to get, a little bit about where you want to
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.720]   go. But I want to just break down... Let's say someone listening has gone
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.320]   through these steps and is planning a trip. I'd love to just go back and forth
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.320]   and talk about some of the things you do.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.720]   So let's say we've now picked a place. Let's say we have decided the why and we
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.400]   know why we're going. What kind of research do you think people should be
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   doing in advance versus leaving up to that serendipity you described earlier?
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.600]   So I'm just going to give you an example from the 52 places trip I did because I
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.240]   think it's very out of the ordinary, of course. But I think there's a lot that
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.120]   can be learned for it. One of the things was because I was going to 52 places in
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.680]   52 weeks, I didn't have time to prepare, right? I luckily had someone at the
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.920]   Times who was helping me and she would send me like a really great one-pager of
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.080]   here's what you need to know about currency and here's what you need to
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.080]   know about public transportation. And here's like the top 10 things to do when
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.200]   you Google the place, right? These are the big tourist hits or whatever.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.560]   I would try to like knock out those 10 things in like an afternoon and be like,
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.920]   "Okay, so I've done the brass tacks. I've seen that. Now, let me actually have an
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.800]   experience." And I think that goes back to this idea of travel being more
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.520]   serendipitous, more spontaneous, more connective than it is extractive.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.160]   I think a lot of the times we think of travel as extractive where it's like,
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.200]   "I need to go in there, get things that make me fulfilled and leave, wash my
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.760]   hands of it and plan the next trip." And I think leaving things open has always
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.080]   led to the best experiences. In terms of preparation, yeah, have a place to stay.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:15.920]   If it's city-based, find a place to stay. I think beforehand, if you can, go as
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.520]   local as possible. And I don't mean Airbnb. Airbnb is fine if that's what you
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.880]   want to do. But I think there is nothing better than staying at a family-run
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.360]   bed and breakfast. I think it's the best. Bathrooms down the hall. Dad's making
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.480]   you breakfast in the morning. Mom's giving you tips of where to go shopping.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.920]   That vibe, I think, opens up so much just in terms of local recommendations,
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.240]   in terms of the feeling of being a local, in terms of supporting local economies.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.000]   You're staying at like a family-run hotel versus the Hilton or whatever.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.640]   That goes a long way in terms of where you're putting your money.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.400]   That's a great place to start. I've had incredible experiences literally just from
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.720]   an innkeeper in Bulgaria, who over the course of 5 days of me staying there,
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.320]   gains my trust. And all of a sudden, he's showing me old family photos.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.400]   And he's showing me into the basement where there's like a fresco on the wall from the
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.880]   Ottoman times. And he keeps it behind glass because it's his greatest possession now.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.600]   And it's in this house that he's owned and his family has owned.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.600]   So just like these experiences that you unlock by going local, by going small.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.800]   I feel like you didn't ask me where you should stay. But I do think that is where most people
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.600]   start. And thinking even the "why" in that decision goes a long way.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.200]   You could just look at TripAdvisor and go to the one with the most reviews with 5 stars.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.120]   But then you're just doing what everyone else did.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.840]   Right.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.560]   And is there a time and a place sometimes for staying in the city center,
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.840]   being really close to things? I don't know if the bed and breakfast are always
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.440]   located in that area, but...
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.160]   Yeah, no, of course. And maybe you do both. Maybe you do the rural bed and breakfast for
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.120]   a couple of days, and then you stay in the middle of a city where you're not really going to be
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.360]   spending time at the hotel anyway. To go back to what my first steps are
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.960]   in feeling that I'm connected to a place.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:59.280]   What I learned to do pretty quickly on my reporting trips, and I think this is reporting-specific,
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.600]   but I think it's general tips for travel too, is when I get to a place, especially if it's a city,
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.800]   first thing I do is I leave the camera in the hotel room.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.240]   I put the phone away in my pocket and I just walk.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:17.520]   I'll give myself an hour and a half, maybe 2 hours, no destination in mind.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.240]   I just want to get the pulse of the place. I just want to feel it.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.240]   And maybe I'll get distracted and sit down for a beer and watch the city go by that way,
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.320]   or a coffee, or sit in a park for a little bit. But I just want to be there.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.160]   And that means not looking at my phone. The great thing about Google Maps is that
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.360]   you can get completely lost and then use it to find your way back, right?
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.920]   If I think a street looks interesting, I'll walk down that.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.960]   If I see a scene happening at the local park, I'll sit down and watch that for 20 minutes.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.440]   If I strike up a conversation with someone, I'll let that go and see where it takes me.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.800]   It's just such a small thing, but it goes such a long way.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.200]   If you're just thinking, of course, you're going to want to document things,
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.280]   you're going to want to post things to Instagram,
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.200]   you're going to want to share it with friends, all this stuff.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.880]   But just wait a couple of hours. Do it starting that evening.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.280]   Give yourself at least a few hours to feel like you're there and you're in the place.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.640]   And maybe you'll see places where you're like, "Oh, I need to come back and photograph that.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.840]   I need to come back during sunset because I bet the photographs here are great then."
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.120]   Or whatever else that you need to do. And I'm thinking of that professionally,
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.440]   of course, as a photographer and a writer, but everyone's into documenting their trips.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.760]   So everyone's thinking of that. But if you give yourself time to just be,
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.120]   it's really amazing how much better you get the place.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.560]   You understand it and you feel it in a way that you don't, again,
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.160]   if you're just like extracting content from it from the moment you hit the ground.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.440]   You didn't mention this, but one thing I like to do where possible and where not ridiculously
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.720]   inconvenient, get to wherever you're going using public transportation when you first arrive.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:50.880]   Taking the train, taking a bus, you see people in their normal environment versus if you were to
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.880]   take a taxi or call Uber in another country, you're just sitting in the back,
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.160]   just moving. So I feel like your trip starts sooner when you do that.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.680]   Yeah. Public transportation is a great tip. I think you really get to know a place.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.720]   There are cities that I know geographically through their subway maps versus their actual
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.760]   maps. I know that this stop is here and this stop is here. And that's my understanding of geography.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.800]   And I think it's something that people get older. And as people have more money and all
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.080]   these things, you stop doing that. When you're a backpacker and you're
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.000]   living off the $20 in your pocket, you're taking public transportation or walking because you're
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.880]   not about to drop half your budget on a taxi. Now, at least for me, who's older,
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.120]   it's much easier for me to be like, "I'll just take an Uber."
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.360]   There's a lot we can learn from our early days of travel,
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.840]   backpacking and whatever else when you're pinching pennies,
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.720]   including the fact that, yeah, public transportation is going to save you money.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.640]   But also, you're seeing the places in between. You're seeing the kind of people that come on
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.200]   on certain stops and get off at certain stops. You get a really better understanding of the place
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:53.040]   by getting on a train or a bus or in South Africa, the combis, the little minivans that go around.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.880]   You just get such a better understanding. Yeah.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.640]   And people will help you too. And that's another thing. It's intimidating. Of course it is. But
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:04.560]   if you're lost, people will help you. I remember trying to find my way around the metro system in
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.280]   Tashkent, Uzbekistan, which is incredible. In the case of former Soviet countries,
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.200]   take the subway just to see the metro stations. They're like works of art. It's unreal.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.040]   So I'm taking the metro around in Tashkent, and I was just so confused. I was like,
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.680]   "I didn't understand the maps." I was sitting there with two handfuls of coins and bills,
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:26.640]   unsure about the denominations. I was jet lagged. And someone saw me immediately and came up to me
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.160]   and in broken English was like, "Where are you trying to go?" I said the name of the stop and
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.640]   just held out my hands with all the coins in it. And he just picked out what I needed, put it in
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.240]   the machine, gave me the ticket and led me on my way. It's like you put your trust in someone,
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.600]   someone's going to help you out. And just that interaction too. I still remember it,
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.480]   and I'll remember it probably forever. Just that small interaction
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.720]   that you're not going to get if you just call an Uber.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:53.120]   So we had the same thing happen in Aleppo, Syria. We got into the city. We took a taxi
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.840]   from Turkey, which fun fact, I'm sure this is different now, but taxis from Turkey to Syria,
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:04.160]   because gas was like 10% of the cost, right? It was so cheap. The taxis would go for free almost.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.640]   The cost to go from Turkey to Syria was almost nothing as long as you had no bags,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.160]   because there were special taxis where their entire trunk was just gas tanks.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.600]   And so you would go into Syria and it would be super cheap, but you'd get dropped off.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.720]   We were couch surfing in a suburb and we had no clue what we were doing.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.320]   And a random person came up who spoke no English, but kind of got the sense that we were lost,
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.800]   called someone, handed me the phone. So just a stranger's handing me a cell phone
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:34.320]   and I answer it. And this person says, "Hey, you don't know me, but my brother thinks you're lost."
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.480]   So he called me. And if you want, you could tell me where you're going. I'll tell him and
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:43.520]   he can help you get there. But he would love if you stopped by his house and have some tea first.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:50.000]   So it was this experience that I think many people could just not be open to or think it's scary,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.720]   but being open to those things has been some of the best experiences we have. Before we get there.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:00.960]   Science has shown that being charitable can actually have a huge impact on your happiness,
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.840]   which is why I'm excited to be partnering with Daffy today. They're a not-for-profit community
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:10.960]   built around a new modern way to give, and they have a mission I think we can all get behind,
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:16.480]   helping people be more generous more often. Amy and I use Daffy for all of our giving
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.720]   because they offer an account that makes it easy to put money aside for charity.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.280]   You can make a one-time contribution, or you can set a little aside each week or month,
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:31.040]   and all your contributions are tax deductible. Except you don't actually have to know exactly
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.280]   where you want to give the money right away. In fact, you can make your tax deductible
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:41.520]   contribution now and invest that money into stocks or even crypto so it can grow tax-free
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:47.360]   and let you have more impact in the future. Then, whenever you're ready, you can give to any of more
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:52.800]   than one and a half million charities, schools, or faith-based organizations in a matter of seconds.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:58.960]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy if you want to start giving today,
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.960]   and for a limited time, if you visit that link, you can get a free $25 to give to the charity of
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:16.000]   your choice. Again, that's allthehacks.com/daffy. Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.160]   used to be. I get it. Life comes at you fast. But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:28.400]   a good hang. So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event. Just make sure you do it
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.760]   the easy way and let our sponsor, Drizzly, the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.560]   supplies. All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together. It doesn't even have to
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:43.600]   be a good one. It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.720]   want to celebrate that you got through another week. With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.440]   taking the drink run off your to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.960]   houses without ever leaving yours. And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.760]   on their massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores. So when I really
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.920]   wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not only could I get
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.600]   an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:22.240]   store. So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com. That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:28.400]   today. Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations. What are you bringing? We don't need
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.480]   to go down to how many pairs of socks. People can figure that out on their own. But are there
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.960]   perspectives you have that are unique or contrarian about things to bring, or "I never bring a
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.960]   rollerboard. I always bring a duffel bag" or just things that might spark some interesting thoughts
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:48.080]   in people listening? I'm not like the militant, carry-on-only school of thought. Maybe now,
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.560]   I might be with the mess that's going on at airports and bags getting lost or whatever. But
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.840]   when I got that 52 Places job, I posted something about how I decided I was just going to check in
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:03.440]   a bag for the year. And of course, travel Twitter just blows up. They're like, "Oh my god, you call
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:07.280]   yourself a traveler? If you can't get all your belongings in a carry-on, you don't actually know
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.200]   how to travel." And I was just like, "Shut up." People can do their own thing. People have their
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:17.040]   own styles. I had to pack for Siberia and Tahiti in the same suitcase. I just didn't want the stress
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:23.200]   of having to do laundry every four days or whatever. So I did it. The bag got lost twice,
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:29.840]   but found its way back to me. So it was fine. But I tell that story to say I'm not dogmatic about
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.640]   packing in any way. Oftentimes, it's happening half an hour before I'm heading to the airport,
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.320]   and I'm just throwing in whatever I feel like. I think there are things that I swear by now.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:44.000]   It's hard to find anything in my travel wardrobe that's not made of merino wool
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.520]   because I think the stuff is magical. It keeps you warm when it's cold. It cools you down when
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:55.360]   it's hot. I've worn it in Gambia during the hottest, rainiest time of year, the same t-shirt
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:59.920]   four days in a row, and it still didn't smell. It's just the stuff is witchcraft. It's unreal.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.520]   That's something I definitely learned through long-term travel. And now I completely swear
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.520]   by merino wool, everything. Where are you getting all these merino wool products?
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.400]   Smartwool is great. I have a lot of stuff from then. Fjallraven. It's all performance stuff.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.440]   You're spending, I don't know, $80 on a t-shirt. And you're like, "Really? $80 on a t-shirt?"
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.200]   But if you only have to bring two t-shirts with you, it's pretty good.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.800]   So yeah, I had one lightweight merino wool and one heavier weight one.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.280]   That was basically all I wore for a year. Packing cubes, I also swear by. I think a
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.680]   lot of people have entered the church of packing cubes, but I think being organized that way
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.920]   really has upped my travel game because I just don't leave things behind anymore because I know
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.400]   everything has a place and I know where everything goes. And if I feel that a packing cube isn't
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.600]   as full as it was when I got there, I know my bathing suit is hanging in the bathroom or
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.480]   something's been left behind. So that, in terms of organization, there's very few loose items in
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.560]   my bags. I know I said I'm not dogmatic about things. And then now I've gone into being like,
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.320]   "No loose items in the backpack." But no, it's true. I have pouches for everything.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.720]   All my tech stuff is in one bag, all my camera gears in another bag, inside the bag.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.760]   And also, when I inevitably get pulled aside at security because of all the electronics in my bag,
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:13.200]   but also for being a brown dude in the 21st century, always the random security check happens.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:17.360]   Then I can just open the bag and I've got four other bags I take out instead of an explosion of
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:23.120]   cables and other gear. Those are my main constants. If I feel like bringing
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:29.040]   an extra pair of earphones for working out or whatever, I'll do that. Sometimes I won't.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.400]   All the other stuff is up in the air, but those are my hard and fast rules.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.600]   I don't know if you followed the new church of in packing for travelers, but it seems to be
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.000]   putting an Apple AirTag in like every bag. And I have not checked a bag since
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.280]   going down this rabbit hole. But it seems like most people that have lost a bag that have had
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:51.440]   an Apple AirTag in it have somehow been able to figure out where it is and get it back.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.200]   That's interesting. I wonder how that plays out, though. Especially now that all these airlines
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.360]   are overwhelmed. Is it that you're going up to them and you're like, "You're saying you can't
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.800]   find my bag? I see it. It's at LAX or whatever." And then what? What are they supposed to do?
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.320]   They're like, "Okay, sure." And then they'll go do whatever process they were going to do.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.520]   I don't know if they're going to go out of their way because you can show them where the bag is.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.080]   I've read multiple stories of people where the bag made it. Let's say you're flying to Denver,
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.680]   the bag's in Denver. And they're like, "We don't know where it is." And you're like, "Actually,
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.320]   I know where it is in the airport." Now, if you're in Denver, and the flight came from London,
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.440]   and you're like, "I know where it is in London." You're probably out of luck and you're going to
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.480]   have to wait. You might be able to say, "Look, I know it's in London. Can you get it?" But
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.960]   to the extent that the bag is lost, maybe it's coming a day late, and I know where it is,
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.040]   you have some idea. Or even just figuring out when it's coming. Sometimes they're like,
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:40.160]   "When the bag gets here, we'll deliver it to you." At least now I know it's here.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:40.800]   It's here. Yeah.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.440]   Or I know that it made it on the plane. You land and you're sitting there like, "Oh man,
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.120]   the bags are coming off. I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it." Some airlines are getting
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.640]   really good. I can't remember whether it was United or Delta or something. I looked in the
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.560]   app and it was like, "We scanned your bag at the check-in. We scanned your bag when it's
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.560]   getting on the plane." Obviously, if you could get that level of detail with every airline,
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:05.440]   it would be unnecessary. But I think people have really liked being able to at least have a sense
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:11.600]   of where is my bag? Is it actually here? Is it coming? If I see that it's still where I took off,
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.280]   I'm not going to sit at the baggage carousel for 45 minutes to see if maybe it's coming.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.720]   I know it's not coming.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.840]   I can see the appeal. For the trips that I have coming up, I'm trying to go carry on just because
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.520]   I've heard about all the chaos. I just did a trip in the Faroe Islands where I was hiking for
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:31.280]   a week basically straight. And it's pretty intense hiking. So I wanted to bring trekking poles.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:35.360]   You can't carry on trekking poles. So it's like, "Okay, do I not bring trekking poles and be
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.280]   miserable? Or do I just bring them and check them in and run the risk of not having them when I get
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.640]   there?" And I chose the latter. And I had the trekking poles. So there's decisions you have
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.960]   to make and I'll probably go on the side of comfort over any kind of hard rules around packing
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.600]   every time.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:55.520]   Trekking poles may or may not be as easy. But in some places, now that we have children,
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.160]   I've noticed there are sites definitely in the US, probably all over the world,
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.920]   where you could say, "Okay, we need a high chair. We need a pack and play. We need these different
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:09.360]   things." You can rent them from local families and not have to travel with them.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:15.200]   I've also done the FedExing ahead of time stuff that I'm going to need there and shipping it back.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.640]   Sometimes, especially now with baggage fees, it ends up being the same as it would be to
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.200]   check in a bag or even less. So for little things like that, that would have been another option.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.920]   Maybe not to the Faroe Islands because it's a little remote and who knows how long it would
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.760]   have taken to get there. But if I'm going to the Dolomites or something and you want to go carry
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.520]   on, just ship the stuff ahead of time to your hotel. They'll accept it and you pick it up when
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.680]   you're there. There's also something... I'm going to probably butcher the pronunciation. It's like
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:45.040]   "Takubin" or something like that in Japan. There's an entire network of services where you can send
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:50.320]   your bags between hotels. And it's the most efficient process as most are in Japan.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.440]   So I know a lot of people that are traveling. It's like, "Well, I want to take the train,
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:58.080]   but I have this big bag. Do I want to lug it around?" So you just pack an overnight bag.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.000]   Sometimes the bag gets there same day or next day. It's like you just pack a day pack,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.440]   you hop on the train, you head down maybe from Tokyo to Kyoto, you go trek around for the day,
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.520]   you go spend the night, you wake up the next morning, you brought just enough for the next
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.080]   morning and your toiletries, and then your bag shows up at your hotel. And you had this
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:22.000]   wonderful experience of both taking the train, not having to go straight to your hotel when you land.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.440]   I don't know if that service exists almost anywhere else. But I know that in Japan,
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.080]   it's a very structured service that's very easy.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.840]   Yeah. I know some people who swear by it. I've never used it, but it makes a lot of sense.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.040]   I think it's Takuhaibun. I can't remember. I'm terrible at pronouncing
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.680]   basically any Japanese term. So we've planned the trip, we've gotten the accommodations,
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.120]   we've gotten there, we've packed all this stuff. You talked about this serendipity of meeting
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.120]   people, locals, immersing yourself in these experiences that you probably couldn't have
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:55.440]   pretended. Do you think there's a way, not necessarily to cheat the system, but to engineer
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.560]   that serendipity to give it a greater chance of happening than you would if you maybe had a whole
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.800]   week with no agenda? Maybe you just go sit at bars, talk to strangers. But what if you have a
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.480]   day and you really want to try to make something local and interesting and magical happen?
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.520]   What would be your advice to someone trying to do that?
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.920]   The first one, I think is obvious to anyone who's traveled before,
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.040]   but it's put the phone away again. Especially when you're traveling alone.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:26.000]   I do it too. It's the best social crutch there is, right? If you're sitting alone and you feel
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.360]   nervous about it or you're bored or whatever else, you immediately pull out your phone. But that
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:34.000]   signals to everyone else that you're busy, you're closed off. The amount of conversations that I've
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.880]   started from just sitting somewhere and just looking around like people used to do when they
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:44.480]   had downtime, just staring into space and making eye contact with someone, saying hello. Next thing
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.840]   you know, they say, "Hello, how are you?" Next thing you're getting invited to grandma's house
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:53.840]   for dinner. That has happened so many times. People are naturally curious, especially for
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:59.360]   solo travelers. They're curious why you're visiting their home, what you're up to while
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.280]   you're there, if you actually have the best recommendations or if you're going on something
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.400]   that they'd consider the tourist path or whatever, they want to steer you somewhere else.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.040]   People are very passionate about where they're from. So tapping into that, going in also being
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.920]   like, "I'm going to be just a little more extroverted than I normally am," goes a long way.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.720]   And I'm an extrovert in the sense that I do get energy from being around friends and family and
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:26.480]   being around people I love. But I'm still a nervous extrovert, if that makes sense. I still get phone
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:33.120]   anxiety and weird nervousness around approaching strangers and all these other things. So it takes
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.880]   an effort for me to be like, "I'm going to strike up a conversation with these random people."
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:42.640]   And just as one example, I was in Munich, which is a city that if you ask people from Munich,
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.920]   they'll be the first to admit that it's not an easy place to meet people.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.080]   It's just part of the, I think, Bavarian culture and such. It's a little more insular,
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:54.080]   a little more insider-y. So I was having trouble. I was there for work too, and I needed a story,
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.040]   and I was having trouble meeting people. And I was hanging out at this bar, not looking at my phone.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.960]   So I was more aware of my surroundings. And I was overhearing this conversation with a bunch
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:08.320]   of dudes standing next to me. And they were talking about space and rockets and astrophysics
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.560]   and all just very fascinating stuff. And it took me a second to work up the courage.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.000]   But once I did, I literally just poked my head and I was like, "Hey, do you mind if I join you?"
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.720]   And they're like, "Yeah, of course. Come on in, whatever." And I brought them around or whatever.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.640]   Next thing I know, I'm talking to these five astrophysicists who are working on some German
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:27.360]   space program in the woods of Munich. Just totally fascinating stuff. We spend the whole rest of the
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.520]   evening together. We go to a show. We just hang out, taking me to all their favorite beer gardens.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.280]   And all because I just took that plunge. And it was a little weird. It's a little awkward
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.920]   to do that in any situation. At least for me, it is. But I took a deep breath and went in there
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.400]   and said, "Hello." And next thing you know, I had this really wonderful, pretty magical day
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.760]   in a city where it's hard to do that. It's hard to find that serendipity.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.480]   So I think those would be my two biggest overarching tips around that is opening
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:58.240]   yourself up to it. And the first step towards that is literally being physically available.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.080]   So stop staring at your phone. Put the book down for a second. Just be there.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.760]   Look around and see what happens. And then two, push yourself to just be a little more
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.200]   extroverted than you usually are. And then actually the third one too, and this goes back
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:15.600]   to mindset as well. And this has taken me a while to really master, if I can even call it that.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:22.080]   But it's admitting your own ignorance and embracing it. I think a lot of the times,
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.480]   especially with well-traveled people, there's a tendency to make it competitive almost, right?
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.320]   Be like, "Oh, I know this. And I've been there. And I know my way around this. And I've traveled,
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.080]   so I don't need help. And I can find my way. And I've read about this place that I'm traveling to.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:39.040]   So I don't need to know anymore." But you're never going to know as much as someone who lives there,
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.080]   who has been born and raised there. You're never going to know as much. You could live there for
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.560]   10, 20 years. I've lived in New York for a decade. I'm not a New Yorker. I'm never going
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.760]   to know New York like a New Yorker. And admitting that leads to you asking the right questions.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.920]   It leads to the approach that you have when you're talking to people, the openness that you bring
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.680]   to new experiences and new culturals and things that might be unfamiliar to you.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:05.760]   All of that first is going to just come across so much more effectively if you first admit that
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.920]   you really don't know anything. And you're there to learn. And you're there to engage.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:15.040]   And I think just that mindset opens up a place in a big way. And it's very hard to do,
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.520]   especially the more traveled you are because you start being like, "Oh,
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.080]   I know my way around. I know how to navigate this stuff."
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:24.000]   And so still for me too, when I'm at a place that I've been to 100 times,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.120]   I still try to approach it as there's still something to learn. I still am not a local.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.840]   I'll never be. So what can I learn from a local? And having that eagerness and that curiosity is
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.440]   going to make you approach the right people and ask the right questions. And then the rest is
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.920]   serendipity. So I love that approach. I've used it a lot.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:44.960]   I just want to thank you, Quik, for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:03.760]   You traveled a lot as a solo traveler. You just got married. Congratulations.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.840]   I've heard you on a couple podcasts say, "One day, maybe there's a family. I have one."
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.520]   How do you think that changes? You haven't been through it yet, but you've probably met lots of
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.560]   travelers. The idea of spending the afternoon sitting in a bar, meeting some astrophysicists,
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:21.280]   going out to a random show is not the kind of experience that's easy to have with
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:27.120]   young kids around. So how do you create these interesting experiences when you probably have
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.360]   a tighter schedule? Have you thought at all about that or talked to anyone that's done it successfully?
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:36.320]   I'd be curious, actually, from you if you felt as your travel style has changed,
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.840]   how you felt yourself adapting. I think what's exciting about traveling with kids and having
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:47.920]   kids is that you now get to instill that curiosity and that sense of serendipity
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:53.120]   in someone new and encourage that in someone and have them grow into the kind of traveler that
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:58.240]   maybe it took you longer to be. And I know that's much easier said than done when there's nap time
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:02.160]   and mealtime and all these things that are pretty set in stone when you're traveling.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.480]   You can't be like, "Peace out, partner. I'm going to go hang out at the bar and meet some
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.680]   astrophysicists, have fun with the kids." But I do wonder if there are micro moments of serendipity
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.160]   that you can create where you can be like, "We've rented this car. We're going to go for a drive on
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.200]   this route that we've researched, but we don't know where we're going to stop yet. We don't
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.960]   know where we're going to have lunch. We don't know where we're going to go for a little hike."
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.120]   These little things that you just leave open enough so that when you do do it,
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.160]   you're discovering it together. You're discovering that moment together. You're
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.280]   having that moment of uncertainty and be like, "Oh, is this the right place for the hike?
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.680]   Ooh, this looks a little intense." But then you do it together and you're like,
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.240]   "Wow, we did that. That was crazy. Remember when we did that thing?"
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.480]   And I think I learned that from my parents too. And my parents were very good about doing that.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:46.640]   I don't remember a lot of things concretely from my childhood, but I have vague,
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:53.600]   more like snapshots. I have so many mental snapshots of family trips, of
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:42:00.320]   the car pulled over on the side of the road, the physical map out over the hood of the car while
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.520]   my parents are tracing our route and trying to figure out where the hell we are and where the
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.080]   hell we're going. I have so many memories of us before smartphones, before the internet,
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.840]   pulling into hotels and knocking on the door and being like, "Hey,
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:16.080]   do you have space for five at 10 o'clock at night?" My parents did that stuff a lot.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:19.280]   Of course, safety was the first priority. When we were younger,
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.560]   there were all these other needs they had catered to, but they still kept that little bit
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:26.960]   of mystery to travel and that little bit of, "We're going to make it up as we go along.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.280]   We're going to improvise a little bit and we're going to do it together.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.240]   And we're going to have a conversation about, "Ooh, which of these 2 restaurants looks better?
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:36.640]   What do you think, little Jimmy?" Bring them into it. Bring them into that experience.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.480]   I think there's ways. I think, yeah, maybe you can't do it like you used to fully
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:44.560]   flying by the seat of your pants. But I think in micro moments and through little adjustments and
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:49.760]   through involving them in your decision-making process as you go, you can still keep that
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.880]   mystery of travel alive. It's funny. As you were talking,
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.520]   I just started thinking about a trip we haven't planned yet, but different ways that we would
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:02.000]   bring it to life with children. And our kids are 2 and 2 months. We're not quite old enough to
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.600]   take them on all the adventures. But a few things came to mind.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:12.000]   One, in the last few, I don't know, months/year, we've met a number of interesting people that
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.840]   live in our neighborhood going to the park. Just the park down the street from our house,
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.840]   we meet parents almost every time. So, for some reason, I hadn't thought about it until
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:24.240]   you were talking. But I feel if you want to meet random strangers, instead of doing it at the bar,
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.040]   where you're sitting having a drink, which might be the solo traveler place of choice,
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.560]   you could also just go to a park. You probably meet other parents. They probably have other
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.280]   kids your same age. You could make that your place to serendipitously strike up a conversation.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.240]   So that was one that came to mind. Another thing that I think
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:45.840]   every person I know that seems to have unlocked travel one level beyond with children
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:52.880]   does is they all contact their hotel in advance or wherever they're staying and try to find some
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:44:00.080]   trusted source of childcare that can, not for the entire trip, but maybe help out one night so the
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:04.800]   parents can go out and have that kind of interesting, unique adventure of just walking down the street,
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.760]   finding a place to eat, etc. Another way to do that, and I have some friends with kids who have
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:15.360]   taken this route as well, is traveling with another family or two families that are friends of yours
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:20.720]   with kids the same age. Then you either can rotate who's in charge of the kids that night while the
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:26.160]   others go out to a show or dinner or to meet people or whatever else. Or you all pull your
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.920]   money together while you're hanging out in France for some childcare that can take care of the kids
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.760]   one of the nights or two of the nights or whatever. And that way you're doing it together and it's a
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.360]   little easier. I know some people who have gone that route too and I think that's a great way to
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:42.240]   tackle it as well. The last one that I'm really excited about, and Japan hasn't opened the borders
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:47.440]   yet, but I'm a big fan. We've been a few times. It's re-experiencing the places that you know a
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:52.080]   little bit. I've never lived in Japan. I've been three or four times. I wouldn't consider myself
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:58.000]   an expert, but I do feel like I know it well enough to make it easier to wander the streets
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.560]   and have a serendipitous experience than I would if I'd gone to Uzbekistan, which I've never been
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:07.360]   to. And I feel like I would be trying to get my bearings as well as lead the family through the
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:12.480]   public transportation. So, one thing I'm excited about is just going to places I've been to share
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:18.320]   that experience and make it a little easier. The first trip with two kids running around a city,
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.080]   probably nice if you'd go to a place you know. Maybe even test it out locally. Maybe we go to
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.840]   New York for a long weekend because it's like, "I know that city even better." We've already
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:30.960]   tested it in San Francisco. We take the Caltrain. We actually throw our bikes on the Caltrain,
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.640]   ride the Caltrain up to San Francisco, bike around, and then come back.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:39.280]   So, we're trying to get a feeling for what it's like to adventure in a city.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.680]   We have our own travel training wheels as new parents that we're trying to take off
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.280]   before we take a big adventure.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.960]   But also, what a fun thing to see a place that you thought you knew well,
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.040]   to see it anew through the eyes of someone else too, right? I think that's why people love taking
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:57.840]   friends to places that they love or whatever. I'm in the middle of planning a bachelor party
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:02.480]   for friends of mine and I'm really excited that they've chosen New Orleans, which is like a city
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:07.440]   that I love so much. And now I'm going to be able to see it anew through their eyes, seeing it for
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.880]   the first time and go to all the restaurants that I love and all the bars that I love and
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.040]   do all these things. And I think that's just like such a fun thing to do. I can imagine with kids
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:19.920]   too to see them get excited about something that maybe you've taken for granted by the fourth or
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:20.480]   fifth visit.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:25.120]   Similarly, probably why I started podcasts. I love learning these things and then sharing them with
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:31.600]   people. The other last one, and I'm fascinated by this broader topic, is when you have a limited
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:37.040]   time and budget isn't the primary concern, you can hire experiences, right? You could do Airbnb
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:41.600]   experiences, you can find locals, even if you're staying at a hotel, ask for a cooking class or
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.880]   these kinds of things. The hidden mystery of fixers in other countries that help engineer
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.120]   experiences and crazy things.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:53.360]   I've always been fascinated by finding the most authentic ones versus the most commercial ones.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.960]   So I'd love your thoughts there. But that's the other thing. It's like if you only have
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.760]   a couple days and you've got a tight schedule, and you want to go have some authentic experience
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:07.520]   cooking with a local, sometimes you don't have time to just go find the random local until
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:11.040]   someone invites you to cook in their home and you might just have to hire it.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.560]   What are your thoughts on those? Are there better ways to do it? How do you find those
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.280]   interesting people?
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.000]   I've done that route many times. And I try to look as local as possible. So it takes some
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.520]   Googling, it takes some digging. So you're not necessarily going through a Viator or Airbnb
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:29.840]   experiences or whatever, which some of them are very local, some of them are very small.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:35.200]   But if you just start Googling walking tours of this city, you might find someone who has
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.360]   their own ramshackle operation that they do.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.200]   And that's the most intimate experience you're going to get. So I think doing some digging
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.160]   until you find something independent on its own.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:49.040]   I used to really be... I don't know, some chip on my shoulder about being a...
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.280]   Exactly what I was talking about, being an experienced traveler.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.120]   I don't need this stuff or whatever.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:58.640]   I used to be pretty against the idea of the walking tour or even the group tour in general.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.600]   I used to be like, "I don't need that. I can find my own way."
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:06.400]   But a lot of cities, especially in Europe, have these free walking tours that leave 3
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.640]   times a day from the center of town or whatever.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.560]   And I started doing those when I was traveling in Europe.
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:16.080]   And I fell in love with them. It was such a great way to just get an overview of a place
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.040]   and get a little bit of background before you start your own explorations.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:24.400]   But also, I found that a lot of the tour guides are not only awesome, but if you talk to them,
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.920]   they're down to hang out beyond just the tour.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.800]   They're doing the job for the money, of course, paid by the city,
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.880]   but also because they love meeting people and they love showing people where they're from.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:39.600]   Two examples, one in Cadiz in Spain, and one in a city in Germany,
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:44.000]   where I could tell that the vibe of the tour guides was really good.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.360]   And so afterwards, I was like, "What are you up to this evening? What are you doing?"
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.400]   And they're like, "Oh, nothing."
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.360]   I was like, "Can I take you to dinner at your favorite restaurant? You down to hang out?"
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.640]   And next thing you know, I'm having this amazing experience because I've just taken that plunge of
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.840]   being like, "Okay, you gave me the city-sanctioned tour.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.560]   Now can I buy you a drink and you can give me the other side of things?"
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.280]   I think doing that is a great jumping-off point to meeting people.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:08.880]   I think you'll find that the same people who are working in tourism, who are offering tours,
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:14.000]   are very interested that you're there and are very enthusiastic about showing you around.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.520]   So I think that that's a great place to start.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.920]   In terms of actual companies, I think the more local, the better.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:25.680]   If you can find someone who doesn't work for a major chain or whatever else who's just doing it
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.480]   on their own, in my experience, they give the best tours.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.360]   I don't think asking the person who took you on a tour to go to a public restaurant and have
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:37.680]   a conversation is a very risky proposition. But I do know that we live in this culture
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.360]   where there's constant fear of "What might happen down this alley? What's going on?"
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.600]   You've traveled to so many places. One of the reasons I originally wanted to
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:52.080]   connect with you was that the New York Times 52 places was my annual travel inspiration.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:58.080]   At least half a dozen places I've been in my life were because that post got me inspired.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:02.160]   The fact that you got to go on all but one of the 52 in a year,
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:06.480]   while that might have been a grueling adventure, it was certainly something that is going to go
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.800]   down as probably one of the more memorable travel experiences of your entire life, I assume.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.240]   What are some of the experiences you had on that year
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:19.200]   that you think are fascinating and worth sharing for people to hear about?
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:26.400]   Yeah. I did a lot of really incredible things, like surface level incredible things. I saw
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:33.120]   a total solar eclipse from an astronomical observatory in the deserts of Chile. I saw...
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:39.280]   I was like me and 3 other people and the colony of hundreds of king penguins in the Falkland
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:44.000]   Islands. I saw all these incredible things. But I know it's going to sound cheesy and I can hear the
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.160]   eye rolls from here. But it's true that when I think back of the year, the first
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:53.200]   images that come to my mind are not all the beautiful things I saw and all the amazing
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:59.440]   things I ate. It's people's faces. It's people I met. It's 100% my biggest takeaway from that
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:06.160]   were the interactions I had with human beings. I think of the woman in Denmark who literally
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:11.440]   called in sick to work for a week just so she could show me around Alborg. I had dinner with
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:16.400]   her family and she showed me all her favorite places. It's the guy in Samarkand, Uzbekistan,
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:21.440]   who drove me out to see a game of kopkari, which is this incredible sport where you have all these
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:26.880]   guys on horses playing a game of keep away with a dead goat that's been stuffed with rice.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:31.520]   And I was the only tourist there, literally thousands and thousands of local spectators
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:37.600]   and just me alone there. Incredible. Again, just from an interaction turning into an experience.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:44.960]   It's the family that hosted me in Orcas Island, this family who has a farm. And on my birthday,
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:49.200]   I was there alone on my birthday. So they said, "We got to celebrate." And so they killed a duck
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.680]   in my honor. And we prepared and ate an entire duck and had this huge feast with this family.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:57.280]   Three generations of this family who has been on this island in Washington State
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.960]   for years and run this farm there. It's like these experiences that really
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.080]   stuck with me and changed the way I think about travel in the future too.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:08.320]   I am looking for those human interactions now when I'm on the road, no matter how small,
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:12.640]   even in places where I'm going for the nature. I just got back from the Faroe Islands,
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:18.160]   which is this incredible, beautiful, just naturally stunning part of the world. Just
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:24.000]   incredibly high dramatic cliffs, so green, just empty stretches of land where you don't see any
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.480]   sign of human habitation. And I went on these beautiful hikes and saw puffins and all these
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.720]   other seabirds. And it's just really incredible. But one of my favorite experiences was talking
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:38.400]   to these random group of 20-somethings who had rented out a small house there for the weekend.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:42.640]   They'd come from one island to another island. And next thing you know, they were offering me
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:49.520]   fermented lamb and whale jerky and 2 different bottles of gin to try the different gins from
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:54.080]   the Faroe Islands. Just having this really great serendipitous encounter that lasted like 30
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:59.440]   minutes because I had to get on a ferry. And that was... That's what stuck with me.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:04.880]   So I don't know. It's just... That's... For me, all my favorite experiences with travel,
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:11.120]   including with the 52 Places trip, have involved other people. And I use that to inform what I do
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:16.480]   and how I approach and how I think about the "why" of travel. It's really influenced the way I think
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:21.520]   about those things now going forward. Okay. I'm going to take a quick pause because we ended up
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:26.560]   spending 20 minutes going continent by continent around the world, sharing our favorite places to
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:31.520]   go. And given the positive feedback I got from splitting out a bonus episode last week, I thought
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:36.240]   I'd do the same this week. So if you want to hear Sebastian and I offer up some inspiration for your
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:42.240]   next trip, come back on Friday and check it out. Also, quick reminder that I'm doing a Q&A episode
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:47.520]   soon focused on travel, credit card, points, or miles. So please send any questions you have my
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:54.000]   way. Chris@allthehacks.com. Okay, back to wrap up the conversation. Any other parting travel advice
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.520]   before we take off? I do want to reiterate that at the end of the day, don't get too attached to
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:04.240]   the "where". Don't get too attached to a list that you've given yourself. I mean, it's nice to dream
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:08.240]   and it's nice to imagine. It's nice to research and think about these places. And sure, maybe it's
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:14.320]   nice to write it down too. But I think the bucket list, as we've long thought about it, is a thing
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.240]   of the past. And I think we need to start thinking in terms of experiences. I think we need to start
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.920]   thinking in terms of exchange instead of just enrichment. I think we need to start thinking
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:28.720]   in terms of just having the best experience. And that can happen in your own backyard. And that
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:33.280]   can happen in places where not everyone is going. And it can happen at the time of year
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:37.840]   that not everyone is going. I don't know why we all have to go to Europe in the summer and
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.360]   Mexico in the winter and whatever else. Death to the bucket list. Death to the high season.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:45.600]   All that stuff, I think, is things of the past. And we need to start thinking differently
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:49.600]   in terms of why we travel and think less about where we travel.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:54.960]   I agree. The high season is just sometimes a worse experience. You get the great weather,
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:55:00.400]   but you don't get everything else. And it's twice as expensive. Awesome. Where can people
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:05.520]   read what you're writing, see what you're seeing, and follow you along all your adventures?
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:09.360]   Yeah. So these days, I'm writing exclusively for Lonely Planet, where I'm an editor-at-large. So
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:13.760]   you can find my work there. If you search my name in Lonely Planet or just go to the website and
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.240]   click around a bit, we have a lot of other great content there. In terms of my personal content,
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:26.000]   @SebModak, S-E-B-M-O-D-A-K, on Instagram and Twitter, where I often upload my latest stories
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.520]   and share photos and everything else for my travels. And there's a few other things in the
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:34.800]   works, potentially a newsletter and some other things that I'm working on. So just follow me
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.080]   on those social medias and you'll hear about them and you'll hear about where I am and where I'm
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:44.160]   going next. That's awesome. I really appreciate it. I have a long list that is not a bucket list,
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:49.760]   but a long list of things to be inspired by. And I'm excited for more travel to come in the future.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.880]   Thanks for having me on. Hopefully, there's some takeaways here. I know it's not as
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:56.560]   concrete as some of the people you talk to who are like, "You need to do this for a rental car
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:00.320]   or this for a credit card or whatever else." It's different to be talking in these esoteric
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:05.200]   terms. But I do think it's important and I appreciate you having me on and chatting about it.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.320]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.440]   Cheers.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:12.480]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode. Thank you so much for listening.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:17.120]   As I mentioned earlier, you can catch Sebastian and I go around the world sharing our favorite
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:21.920]   countries to travel to in a short bonus episode on Friday. And if you haven't left a rating or
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:26.000]   review on the show and Apple Podcasts, I'd really appreciate it. I'm still on a quest
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.440]   to get to 1000 reviews and every single one means so much to me. Thank you so much to everyone who's
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:35.920]   already written one. If you have any feedback on the show, questions for me, or just want to say
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:50.560]   hi, I'm Chris@allthehacks.com or you can DM me on social. See you Friday.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:57:00.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
