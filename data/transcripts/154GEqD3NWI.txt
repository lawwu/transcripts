[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   All right, Jesse, we like to talk about each month.
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.160]   The books I read the last month, long time listeners know my goal is to read five books
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.160]   per month.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.680]   So we're in February now.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:19.840]   So we will talk about the five books I read in January, 2023.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.080]   The first one was called sitting by the mini bay, my life and building model docks by Dwayne
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.080]   Johnson.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.800]   It's a surprising twist, surprising turn by him.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.320]   It has over 50 pages of photos.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.920]   He's shirtless in most of them.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.920]   Interesting.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.520]   He builds his mock docs shirtless.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.120]   So there you go.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.120]   Now what did I read?
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.120]   All right, let's go through this quickly.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.320]   Book number one, a thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.760]   So this is a new theory about how the cortex helps create human consciousness and intelligence.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.200]   Jeff Hopkins is a former tech executive who put all of his fortune into trying to figure
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.240]   out how the brain works and then build intelligent machines using this research.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.600]   This is his latest book with his latest findings.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.880]   If if ever there's like Reese terminator style character who comes back from the future to
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.160]   prevent Skynet from going online, it's probably looking for Jeff Hawkins.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.520]   Let's be honest about that.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.520]   All right.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.080]   I also read the nineties by Chuck Klosterman.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.920]   So Klosterman writes these books where I don't know if you've ever seen a Klosterman book,
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.360]   but he's been doing these more recently.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.720]   Like the nineties is just looking at the nineties and it's just all these different smart cultural
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.040]   critiques about different aspects of the nineties, which is when you and I were kids.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.040]   It was good.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.720]   I've heard it was really good on tape.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.600]   I read the physical version.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.600]   I enjoyed it.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.600]   I mean, it helps.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.840]   So I grew up then, but actually I might lend it to you.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840]   I think you would like it.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.200]   Any examples?
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.760]   I mean, I think the music stuff is interesting.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.680]   I mean, I was really deep on really what was happening behind the scenes with grunge and
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.360]   these musicians and the whole selling out culture that Gen X had created and how that
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.680]   clashed against the commercial imperatives of music.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.320]   I actually learned a lot about like Kurt Cobain, for example.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   Interesting.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.920]   It doesn't make me think of, I don't look back after I read this book and say, man, I
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.040]   wish I could go back to the nineties.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.520]   It's an interesting time and it's interesting to think about, but it doesn't make me want
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.520]   to go back.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.200]   I'm like, I'm going to find out that you're the 70 show.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.680]   So when we were growing up in the nineties, there's a show called the 70 show, which was
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.360]   a sitcom about life in the seventies.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.100]   Well now we're 30 years, 20 or 30 years out of the nineties.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.240]   They're doing a new show called the 90 show.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.760]   Cause when we were growing up in the nineties, the seventies was as far from us as the nineties
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.520]   are far from people who are kids today.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.800]   So our childhood is now going to be the target of the nostalgic retrospective show.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.000]   It was a good time to be a New York Yankee fan if you're, yeah, late nineties.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   All right.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.440]   Uh, then I read a quite a good thriller, actually.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.600]   Robin Cook's very first thriller coma in the 1970s, straight up one of the first medical
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   thrillers.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.480]   So him and Crichton were both working on this, but, uh, cook was, I believe he got to the
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.400]   punch first and it's, you know, it's creepy as hell.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.680]   Like in the end there's coma patients, they're being put into comas surreptitiously.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.520]   So they could harvest their organs, not the spoiler alert.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.160]   Um, really well written.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.640]   The interesting thing about it, unlike some modern thrillers is it's, I don't know, the
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.240]   last third before you get to any actual, I am being chased like any, I mean, the first
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.080]   two thirds of the book is really this new resident sort of starting to unravel the conspiracy
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.280]   and, and doing investigations.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.520]   And the main stakes are, you know, her supervisors at the hospital are mad at her or that if
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.200]   she's not at round, she might get in trouble.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.760]   So it's, and yet it still works.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.240]   Uh, nowadays a modern thriller, it's, you know, the second page, the shark is being
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.080]   shot at you from the cannon and you have to kill it with a laser sword.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.280]   You know, it gets right into it.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.840]   So different time, but great book.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.160]   When you read thrillers, you breeze through them.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.400]   Um, I'm not, I'm not a fast reader.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.000]   My wife is a fast reader.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.720]   When she reads novels, she's like, I'm just, because I read a lot of nonfiction and write
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.720]   a lot of nonfiction.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.160]   It's hard for me to speed up.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.520]   So I'm the guy reading that's thinking, okay, well, interesting.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.200]   They referenced the computer mainframe in chapter two, and they noted that it was using
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.440]   hexadecimal and now we're in chapter four.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.520]   And I'm wondering, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm reading these thrillers like I'm studying
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.720]   Proust, which is probably not the fastest way to do it.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.400]   When you say you're not fast, are you really fast?
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   I don't read these books very fast.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.560]   I'm not, I'm not a speed reader or not.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.560]   I'm not even like a fast reader.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.220]   I go too slow because I'm, my mind always wants to understand everything and fit everything
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.480]   into, into I'm going to what Jeff Hawkins at a thousand brains would call reference
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.480]   frames.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.440]   My brain, that book helped me understand my own brain.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.200]   I have like an overactive reference frame system.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.520]   Everything I encounter has to be fit into these frames and I'm incredibly unhappy until
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.520]   it is.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.520]   So I can't read things fast.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.520]   I can't have loose ends.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.960]   I need to, okay, here's this person, here's the building, here's the rooms in the building.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.560]   Like it's very useful when it comes time to solve math proofs or write things, but
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.520]   it, I can't, I'm just physically uncomfortable.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.240]   If it doesn't bother my wife at all, if she's like, Oh, I don't remember if like, Oh, who's
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.240]   this guy?
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.240]   Was he dead?
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.320]   Or, you know, I'm like, no, no, I need to know like exactly his, like, who did he connect
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.320]   to?
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.660]   How is this house laid out?
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.660]   So I can't read fast.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.540]   I mean, you're right.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.200]   Maybe it's fast compared to depends on the relative.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.620]   One more quick question about this.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.320]   When you read a 10 page New York article, how long does it usually take you?
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.320]   A while.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.100]   If I read like a standard, because you know, I always try to read at least one article
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.020]   from the magazine each week when it comes out.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.020]   Half an hour.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.020]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.020]   Okay.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.520]   Like I'll read it in the morning sometimes for the kids get up and it will take the whole
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.680]   time and sometimes I'll have to come back to it.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.440]   Because I'm like every, because, but I'll come away and be able to tell you everything
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.240]   that happened at New Yorker article, some of the stylistic choices of the author, you
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.320]   know and I pulled out like two second order theories that we could potentially talk about
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.320]   on the show.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.040]   So it's like a very cognitively involved process for me when I'm reading.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.320]   I'm a machine for turning text into a connected internally consistent theories and ideas.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.320]   Like that's what I am.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.080]   I've been like bred in a lab to do that.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.080]   All right.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.080]   Next.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.800]   This is not really a, these aren't, neither of these are really books, but I just read
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.280]   them back to back because one influenced the other.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.880]   I read this over Martin Luther King weekend was a Thoreau's on civil disobedience.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.020]   And then Martin Luther King's letter from a Birmingham jail, the latter of course inspired
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.320]   by and pulling from the former.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.320]   So I thought it'd be interesting to read those, read those back to back MLKs I think is much
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.320]   better than Thoreau's.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.200]   I mean, I get Thoreau's at the time there.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.720]   I mean, obviously it was an innovative thought.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.200]   Gandhi pulled from an MLK pulled from it but doesn't age as well.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.840]   And in part because he created a world that's been more normalized.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.880]   So it doesn't seem as, as retroactive, but it's, you know I'm not going to pay my tax
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.400]   until my friend comes like three hours later and pays for me to get out of my small jail
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.920]   in the town where I'm related to everybody.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.240]   It just feels very different.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.720]   An MLK as a rhetor, rhetorician is so good.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.520]   Just his ability to make an argument and to inject a sort of a humanity into it.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.600]   Yet it's still just rock solid.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.160]   This clicks to this, this sort of inevitable logic with emotion.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.520]   I mean, just absolute once in a century type ability.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.120]   So you read these back to back and Thoreau, I mean, I love Thoreau.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.800]   Thoreau is very influential to me, but you see the, the person who's really throwing
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.640]   the 105 mile per hour fastballs MLK there.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.920]   Not Thoreau.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.040]   And then the last was well, I don't know how many people are going to follow me up on this
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.040]   recommendation.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.200]   The Feynman lectures on computation.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.760]   There's a book form collection of a series of lectures that Richard Feynman gave at Caltech
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.300]   about computation.
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.880]   And I pulled from it before for various classes I taught, but I read that right at the beginning
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.960]   of January because I didn't teach last semester.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.360]   I was on leave.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.360]   And then before that was summer.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.720]   So I hadn't been in a classroom since May, 2020, and I wanted to get back in the mood.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.720]   So I was like, all right, I'm going to read Feynman's lectures on computation, just to
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.840]   get back in the computer science, the pedagogical Feynman's a physicist, not a computer scientist.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.000]   And he just, so he comes at these things like with really originality and new takes.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.280]   I just thought it would put me back in the mood of, you know, Hey, let's explain things
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.000]   to people in useful ways.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It was pretty good.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.400]   Like 50% of the stuff I really loved reading about 20%, I'd know it so well, I teach it
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.440]   and the fields advanced as Feynman wrote it.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.240]   I'm like, this is like a worst version of it.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   And then the other, whatever percent is left was really just physics stuff.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.600]   I didn't care about the stupid reversible circuit stuff.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.320]   It's like, I don't need to hear any more about reversible circuits, but like his information
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.280]   theory and coding theory chapter is fantastic.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   So there you go.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.520]   I don't know how many people will take me up on that last recommendation, but the Feynman
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:11.040]   lectures on computation doesn't move as fast as coma by Robin cook.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.640]   It's not the similar genre, but I enjoyed it.
