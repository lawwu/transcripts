[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Hey everyone, since recording this episode, a lot has happened with crypto and specifically
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.520]   BlockFi.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.720]   I'm recording this on the morning of November 15, 2022, and after the downfall of the crypto
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.920]   exchange FTX, BlockFi put a hold on all customer withdrawals, leaving many people, myself included,
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.120]   with a lot of crypto on the platform.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.400]   I am angry about the way this was all handled and communicated, and certainly not happy
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.120]   about the financial situation they've put me and many others in.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.480]   I truly hope that they're able to find a way through all of this that results in everyone
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.920]   getting back their money, so obviously any recommendation you might hear for BlockFi
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.320]   in this episode should be ignored and considered outdated.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.560]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.100]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much more,
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.600]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which actually gets
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.720]   harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.360]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.860]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in everything
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.360]   from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.580]   I'm a member of Longangle, I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.860]   one of the founders, Tad Fallows, join me on All the Hacks in episode 87 to talk about
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.680]   alternative investments.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.480]   Now the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly successful
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.840]   individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn from each other in a confidential,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.320]   unbiased setting.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.040]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.800]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community because you're
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.760]   getting advice and feedback from people in a similar situation to you on everything from
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.200]   your investment portfolio, to your children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.660]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online, so if you have more
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.800]   than $2.2 million in investable assets, which is their minimum for membership, I encourage
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.640]   you to check out Longangle and it's totally free to join.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.800]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more, and if you choose to apply, be sure to let them

[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.920]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E dot com.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:29.280]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.720]   life, money, and travel, all while spending less and saving more.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.920]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and today I'm talking to Zach Prince, the co-founder and CEO of
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   BlockFi.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.840]   If you don't know BlockFi, they're a crypto-first banking platform where you can earn interest,
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.020]   borrow cash, and trade crypto all in one place.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.480]   In our conversation, we not only discuss crypto things like earning 8.6% on your cash and
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.480]   how to think about holding crypto in your overall investment portfolio, but we also
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.160]   discuss Zach's favorite investing hacks, like how to use options to generate income.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.120]   And before we jump in, if you're enjoying the show, I'd really love your help.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.480]   If you could either pick your favorite episode and share it with a friend or leave a five-star
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.920]   review in the podcast app, I would really appreciate it.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.560]   All right, let's get to it.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.600]   Well, after one more quick thing.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.560]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.800]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and do not reflect
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.640]   the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640]   decisions.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.080]   Zach, thanks for joining.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.320]   Chris, pumped to be here, man.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.400]   I'm excited to talk about hacks.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.440]   So before we jump in, could you give everyone a little background on yourself?
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.080]   How did you end up running BlockFi?
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   Yeah, sure.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.200]   I grew up in Texas and moved to New York City after I finished school.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.880]   I've always worked at venture-backed technology companies.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.680]   I was originally in the advertising technology sector and more recently, I've been in the
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.120]   fintech sector at a couple of online lending businesses prior to starting BlockFi.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.320]   While I was at one of those online lending businesses, I got a ton of exposure to all
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320]   things fintech.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.720]   We were kind of like a data aggregator and technology provider and so I just saw so many
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.760]   interesting things happening in the ecosystem and I started writing a blog about whether
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.120]   or not people should be using robo-advisors or whether or not you should be investing
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.400]   in fractionalized real estate and nobody ever read it and podcasts weren't a thing yet,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.120]   so I didn't have a cool podcast platform.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.920]   But that experience led me to Bitcoin for the first time and I was basically yelling
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.480]   on this blog back in 2014 that just from a risk-return perspective, you should be buying
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.200]   a little bit of Bitcoin if you were young and had any amount of risk tolerance because
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.860]   it could potentially do 100x.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.840]   And unfortunately, that kind of came true in early 2017 on the momentum of excitement
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.480]   from the price appreciation, I decided that I really wanted to get involved in the crypto
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.640]   space full-time.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.120]   And that desire led me to the idea for BlockFi, which originally was to build debt and credit
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.400]   products for the crypto ecosystem.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.320]   And we've from that starting point expanded to where we are today, which I would describe
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.160]   as crypto-first banking solutions or crypto-first wealth management solutions.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.760]   But yeah, that's how we got here.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.640]   Yeah, so what made me reach out was I opened up a BlockFi interest account and right now
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.320]   interest rates are kind of at all-time lows and kind of give people an idea of what it
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   is.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.320]   Yeah, sure.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.760]   And it's 8.6% in an account that's liquid.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.480]   So you can go in and out in a 48-hour window if you want, which is very different than
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.440]   a lot of other kind of online lending or private credit opportunities where sure, you might
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.840]   be able to get high single-digit yields, but you're dealing with something that's illiquid
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.760]   or on a much longer duration than the BlockFi interest account.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.120]   But the way it came about is we started originally with our first product, which is enabling
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.560]   people to borrow dollars secured by the value of their cryptocurrency.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.680]   And launching and starting to scale that product led us to the realization that there was a
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.320]   lot of borrowing demand for cryptocurrencies in the marketplace because prime brokers weren't
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.800]   supporting big trading firms that were getting active in the crypto market.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.200]   And so we started lending cryptocurrencies to these big institutions and then we needed
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.040]   more and so we launched the interest account, initially just offering a yield on Bitcoin,
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.200]   Ethereum, and a couple of other cryptocurrencies.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.440]   But then we quickly expanded that to include stablecoins, which are one-to-one interchangeable
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.000]   with dollars in a bank account.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.560]   And now using the interest account, folks can get a high yield on all of those assets.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:58.760]   So it's a 5% on Bitcoin, 4.5% on Ethereum, 8.6% on stablecoins, which are interchangeable
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.160]   one-to-one with dollars in a bank account.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.600]   And the reason, often the first question we get from folks who are like, "You're paying
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.920]   me 8.6% on cash?
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.920]   This is insane.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   Why is this even possible?"
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.080]   Well, the fundamental reason why this is possible is that banks aren't active in the crypto
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.080]   space yet.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.240]   And the crypto space has experienced a ton of growth.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.960]   There's been a ton of wealth creation, and there's also a lot of volatility.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.080]   And all of those things combine to create a pretty large market of borrowing demand.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.320]   And because banks are not actively lending into this space, and in general, the crypto
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.800]   world doesn't have access to traditional sources of capital, the cost of borrowing is high.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.720]   And what we're doing with the BlockFi interest account is basically giving folks a really
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:55.360]   easy, seamless way to take advantage of that market dynamic and earn 8.6% on your cash,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.560]   even if you don't want to buy Bitcoin.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.000]   And then you can also, of course, buy Bitcoin on our platform and earn interest on that
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   as well.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   But that's how it works.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.600]   If anyone's used a fintech platform, they'll feel very familiar with how things work at
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.600]   BlockFi.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.080]   You go through a quick KYC process, connect your bank account using Plaid, transfer some
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.520]   money in, and then the next morning, you'll see your accrued interest.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.200]   And once a month, the interest becomes part of your balance.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.560]   And it's a relatively straightforward user experience.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.240]   There's a lot of fancy stuff that goes on in the background in terms of how the lending
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.760]   works and the risk management.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.880]   I'm really happy to say that we've never lost a penny across any of the lending that we
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.880]   do at BlockFi.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.240]   It's a very low risk type of lending where we're getting collateral for every loan that
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.240]   we're making on the platform.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.920]   Yeah, that's the interest account.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.400]   Yeah, I can attest to an easy process.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.200]   I've signed up, I've put cash in there, and I've earned interest each month at a much
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   higher rate.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.960]   I think in the finance industry, there's always this trade-off that everyone talks about of
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.960]   risk and reward.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.440]   8.6% is a lot.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.720]   Can you talk about the risks that someone might take putting money here versus leaving
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.200]   it in a bank account earning almost nothing?
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.360]   Yeah, there is a very important disclaimer, which is this is not a bank account.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.840]   As a result, it does not come with FDIC insurance.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.800]   It's also not a securities account with SIPC insurance.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.600]   This is really from a, where does this fit in the spectrum of investing?
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:28.320]   I think it's closest to private credit opportunities or maybe real estate financing platforms.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:35.040]   But the risk, in my mind, is much lower because similar to real estate, you're participating
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.120]   in something where there's an asset that's being provided as collateral for the loan.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.940]   The big difference is just that the asset that we're financing at BlockFi and folks
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.920]   who are holding dollars on our platform are financing is a liquid asset.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.320]   So you're basically taking part in a system that lends folks 50 cents on the dollar secured
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   by their Bitcoin.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.360]   And then BlockFi manages all of the risk management related to that in terms of if the Bitcoin
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.480]   price goes down, we're issuing margin calls or selling a little bit of the Bitcoin to
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.280]   make sure that there aren't any losses.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.720]   So can you just dive one level deeper?
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.480]   So if I'm putting money in my BlockFi interest account, you're loaning that money out.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.520]   You said it's collateralized, like 50 cents on the dollar, somewhere in that ballpark.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.960]   That means that someone borrowing has to put more money in than they're actually borrowing
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.160]   in dollars or in stable coin?
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.600]   And you can actually see this dynamic within your BlockFi account.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:34.640]   So in the same account where you can earn 8.6 percent if you're holding dollars in the
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.720]   account as stable coins, you can also access our loans product where if you borrow dollars
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.720]   at a 50 percent LTV relative to your Bitcoin, so let's say you have one Bitcoin, it's around
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.720]   $55,000.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:52.840]   So you could borrow up to $27,500 secured by that one Bitcoin.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.560]   You would pay roughly 10 percent for that.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.560]   You know, what we're doing is charging one side 10, paying the other side 8.6, and then
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.240]   also managing a lot of just liquidity and kind of portfolio level risk.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.440]   So for every $100 that comes in and is held in an interest account, we're not lending
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.960]   out $100, we're lending out $70 or $80.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.560]   And the reason for that is that you want to make sure that you always have ample liquidity
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.480]   in the system to process withdrawals or originate new loans.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.560]   And so there's a bit of complexity behind the scenes, but fundamentally, that's how
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.560]   it works.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.840]   And is your system fully automated such that if Bitcoin at three in the morning starts
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.760]   going down and the interest account holders are all worried, what's going to happen?
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:42.080]   Are you able to sell the assets that you have on collateral in real time or as things are
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.240]   falling if you need to?
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.960]   Obviously, you don't want to, but if you need to protect the people that have interest accounts?
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.000]   And that's one of the unique things about the crypto market.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.360]   I think one of the products that's relatively analogous to our loan product would be a margin
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.280]   account for securities or a securities backed loan where you have a bunch of shares of Amazon
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.040]   stock and you don't want to sell them, you borrow against the value of those shares.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.720]   If Amazon stock goes down in value, at a certain point, you're going to get a margin call from
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.480]   that broker that gave you the loan.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.240]   The big difference is that in crypto, the market trades 24/7, so our system runs 24/7.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.800]   And in that scenario where the price is falling at 3 a.m., our system's working at 3 a.m.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.920]   and it can issue margin calls and sell Bitcoin if it needs to.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:38.240]   In the traditional market scenario, it's a little bit more risky in some ways because
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:44.600]   what happens is the market closes, Amazon releases earnings, and based on how those
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.880]   earnings do, and Amazon's a really large cap stock, so probably not the best example, but
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.000]   it releases earnings after hours, liquidity is thin, let's say there's a big surprise
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.160]   up or down, by the time the market opens the next day, you might have gapped down pretty
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.080]   significantly by the time you can actually sell or do anything again.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.160]   In crypto, it just runs 24/7.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.760]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.960]   Now, in part of my diligence, and again, full disclosure, I'm a BlockFi customer, I noticed
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:15.200]   there are lots of other companies out there doing various versions of taking a stablecoin
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.480]   and earning return.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.200]   Is there something different that BlockFi does that people should keep in mind if they're
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.720]   considering all of the alternatives?
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:30.800]   BlockFi is the only company that offers this type of functionality in the crypto ecosystem
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:37.000]   that is available to retail investors, domiciled and regulated in the U.S., so we're regulated
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.960]   like a fintech company, we have numerous licenses across the U.S., and that is led by a team
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:50.480]   of financial services professionals who come from precisely the backgrounds that you would
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.280]   want folks to come from if they're managing a platform like ours.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.040]   If you get into the crypto world, there can be spectrums of shadiness, for lack of a better
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:06.600]   term, and there are some folks out there who cosmetically might look the same as BlockFi,
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.360]   offering you an interest rate on a certain asset, but they did an ICO, which was effectively
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:16.120]   an illegal securities offering, and they're domiciled in some foreign jurisdiction that
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.240]   doesn't have as strong of a rule of law as the U.S., and then the last thing I would
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.200]   say is just our track record.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.680]   We really invented a lot of this stuff in this market, and we've been doing it the longest,
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.600]   and we've had perfect performance for our clients throughout our entire history.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:37.680]   In the crypto lending world, I would say that it's a very reasonable assessment to make
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:43.360]   that BlockFi is the safest bet for this type of activity, and then the last thing I would
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:50.640]   add is that we really pride ourselves on providing world-class client service, and so there'll
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:57.440]   never be a scenario with BlockFi where if you have a question or a concern or you want
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.720]   to get in touch with us about anything that you won't be able to really quickly.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:07.040]   We have a phone number and really great response times on chat and email as well.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.680]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.680]   I get it.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.560]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.560]   hang.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.360]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.160]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor, Drizly, the go-to app for
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.920]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.720]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.560]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.720]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.540]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:44.120]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.040]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.080]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.240]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.160]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.540]   only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.280]   less than my local liquor store.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.320]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.320]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.640]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.480]   I've heard people talking about how, "Oh, the rate might be higher with all these DeFi
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.480]   platforms."
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.920]   But none of those come with customer service and liquidity and the structure and security
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.840]   of a company that's regulated in a modern first world country.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.840]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:40.600]   And the rate is actually not higher unless you prescribe value to the tokens that are
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.520]   created by the DeFi protocol.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:48.480]   So the actual yield on your stable coin will be much lower than 8.6%, but then these protocols
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.400]   created their own token and they give you some of that token as rewards.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.840]   And if you go and sell that, then maybe your all in yield becomes higher.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.240]   And I'm a big fan of DeFi.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.120]   I wouldn't want to say anything negative about DeFi whatsoever, but there are some big differences,
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.840]   especially in times of market stress.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.280]   And in times of market stress, companies like BlockFi have the ability to do things with
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.880]   our customers' interests at heart.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.400]   We're structured in a way where our equity capital, which is very substantial, would
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.640]   take the first loss if there ever were any losses.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.600]   And that's very different than a DeFi protocol.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.680]   What's happened in times of market volatilities with some of these DeFi protocols is, "Whoops,
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.480]   the smart contract failed and everybody with a loan got liquidated or people that were
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.000]   depositing had to take a haircut and nobody cares.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.140]   That sucks for you, Mr. Customer."
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.040]   That's just the polar opposite of how we view the world at BlockFi.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.440]   And you said you guys have a lot of equity capital.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:49.480]   Can you give me a sense of how big is BlockFi the company right now, either from a fundraising,
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.160]   valuation, employee's perspective?
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.520]   So we're actually over 700 people now at the company.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:01.680]   The most recent round of funding that we did was a $350 million Series D that was led by
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.160]   Tiger Global and DST and Bain Capital Ventures.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:14.760]   And that round was done about six months after our Series C, which was a $150 million round
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.320]   that closed in Q3 of last year.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.660]   So we've been on a great fundraising trajectory.
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.720]   We haven't had anyone tell us we're wrong.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:29.840]   My co-founder has claimed that we're the fastest in-tech company to go from zero to a $3 billion
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   valuation.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.160]   So we're very fortunate and we've done really well in capital markets and just in terms
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.320]   of being able to build a large business really quickly.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.480]   We talked a lot about the interest on stablecoin, something that's dollar-denominated and easily
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.600]   liquid.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.880]   But holding another asset is part of an investment strategy.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.920]   And I think, while it might not seem like a hack, putting my money to work over the
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:58.560]   last 10, 15 years of savings has been how I saved all the money I have.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.040]   And that's my investment portfolio.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.840]   That's a big hack for me, is just putting money in a market that earns.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.040]   In the state of crypto, an emerging asset class, how do you think about that as part
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.400]   of someone's investment portfolio?
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:15.420]   I mean, look, obviously it's a very personal question and it depends a lot on where folks
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:20.600]   are in their life and what their risk tolerance is and all of those typical kind of personal
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.720]   finance factors.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:28.660]   But for me, as someone that is relatively young, fortunate to be successful in my day
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:35.360]   to day job and have enough discretionary income to invest in things, crypto has been the best
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.320]   investment that I've ever made.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:44.560]   And it started out as 5% of my personal asset allocation.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.720]   But because of the performance and also increasing conviction that I've had in the asset class,
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:56.240]   especially after I got involved in it full time, it's around 50% of my asset allocation
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.240]   now.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:05.120]   And there are these kind of underlying trends in the crypto market that are, regardless
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:11.680]   of the day to day volatility of the market, Bitcoin can go up or down 10, 20% in a single
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.680]   day.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.160]   But if you put that to the side for a second and you zoom out a little bit, this market
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.600]   has so much potential and I don't think that's changing anytime soon.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.640]   And so what I tell folks that I recommend with crypto is invest an amount that you're
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:33.880]   comfortable with, understand that you're making an investment for the long term, you're not
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.160]   turning into a day trader that's going to buy more or sell it tomorrow, depending on
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.640]   which way the wind is blowing in the crypto market.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.120]   And you're probably going to be pretty happy.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.560]   I think there's a very small number of days that someone could have possibly invested
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.560]   in Bitcoin and they're all probably in the last 45 days where you'd be down on it.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.480]   If you bought it six months ago, you're up, if you bought it a year ago, you're up, if
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.280]   you bought it two or three or four years ago, you're up a lot.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:06.600]   And Bitcoin in particular is one of these, in my opinion, genuinely unique assets because
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:14.360]   it is both a kind of store of value hedge against inflation like gold and a venture
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.440]   capital type growth play on a network.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:23.080]   And this is a network that is attracting new users, making more connections into traditional
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.840]   systems and garnering more adoption every single day.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:34.000]   And then there's a lot of other exciting things happening in crypto beyond Bitcoin.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.640]   But I think that thesis and then when you take that thesis and you just compare it to
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:42.280]   the TAM of some of the things that could be disrupted, it becomes clear that this is still
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.520]   very early innings.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.560]   And for me, those are the types of investments that I like.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.200]   Ultimately, I think what you want in an investment is something that has a really big upside
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.040]   and not too much downside.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.640]   I think Bitcoin kind of fits that mold perfectly.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.360]   My day job, I work at Wealthfront.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:03.520]   We have an automated portfolio that we offer people to help them build their wealth.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.360]   And we recently announced that cryptocurrency is something we're exploring bringing onto
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.360]   the platform.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.820]   But when I talk to traditional financial planners and financial advisors, it seems like crypto
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.160]   is not something they're considering putting in the portfolios for their clients.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:25.560]   How far out are we from mainstream investment kind of practice being including this asset
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.560]   class?
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.960]   I think the key qualifier there is investment practice.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:36.480]   We're already, you know, well along the S-curve, I think, in terms of adoption of crypto.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.960]   It's hard to get perfect data, but there's estimates that 10 to 15 percent of Americans
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:47.060]   own cryptocurrency while only about half of Americans own investments.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:53.700]   So out of your population that owns investments, you're already at 20 to 30 percent in the
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.700]   U.S.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.700]   And so that's not nothing.
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:01.620]   That's not like a fringe thing off to the side that can just be completely, you know,
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.620]   written off.
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.060]   You know, the kind of like establishment of financial management infrastructure, whether
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:11.060]   you're talking about banks or private wealth groups or financial advisors, these things
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.260]   take time.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.780]   And I think that in 2017, we had a big run up.
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.800]   We had a lot of retail adoption, which is really cool because this thing really came
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.020]   about driven by retail, which is pretty unique.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.060]   And then it cooled off and everyone was like, oh, yeah, maybe it's dead.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.860]   Then COVID hit and Bitcoin went down a little bit.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:36.780]   But then COVID highlighted for us how everything that's digital is preferred to its analog
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:46.260]   counterpart and how stores of value that can potentially retain or increase in times where
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.620]   we have a rapidly expanding money supply are important to have in a diversified investment
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.620]   portfolio.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.060]   And Bitcoin just nails it on both of those points.
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:24:01.260]   So we come out of the financial craziness caused by COVID and Bitcoin does a 5X in six
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.180]   months and then everyone's like, OK, it's actually here.
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.820]   This is very real.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.380]   So this is the first time that big institutions and the establishment is starting to say it's
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:16.060]   actually real and they're all in the process of figuring out how to integrate it into what
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.060]   they do.
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:22.220]   You're seeing it with fintech companies like Square and PayPal and others.
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:27.060]   I'm a Wealthfront user and I'm really excited for the day that I can either just automatically
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:31.340]   or based on some configuration have Bitcoin as part of my portfolio on Wealthfront.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.180]   I think we're going to get tremendous adoption on that.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:41.180]   And that's part of the underlying trend that's going to drive the ecosystem forward.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.900]   And ultimately, when you're dealing with something like Bitcoin, there's a finite supply.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.580]   And if you get more adoption, there's only one kind of market impact that can have, which
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:54.300]   is that the price will likely be higher in the future than it is today.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:59.380]   Do you think there's any truth to the idea that establishment finances, the traditional
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:04.100]   banks, they're not hyping and pushing and talking about crypto being part of everyone's
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.100]   portfolio because they're still a few years behind and being able to tap into the ecosystem
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.260]   themselves from a technology or infrastructure standpoint?
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.140]   I think that's the entirety of it.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.140]   It's like a switch flipped.
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:20.660]   And as soon as there was a decision within some of the big banks that, yes, we are going
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:26.260]   to develop a crypto strategy, then the messaging flipped from, "Oh, this is a fraud and a scam.
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.260]   Don't pay attention.
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.260]   It's a bubble."
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.180]   The price target on Bitcoin is $400,000.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.420]   We're working on a product to put it in our private wealth management portfolios.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.440]   Come talk to us in six months.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.220]   And that's literally happening in front of our eyes today.
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.220]   No, that's it.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:46.980]   So, yeah, I think a hack is that you have these institutions that aren't necessarily
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:53.820]   publicly embracing it as much as they want to, but if you hear them in industry conversations,
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.820]   they're all in on it.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.620]   They have huge desks working on it.
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:02.240]   So by the time they're tapped into the ecosystem, I have to assume they're going to be talking
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.960]   about it a lot more.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:09.660]   And if you're a part of something before that kind of a moment happens, it usually is good
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.100]   for the people that were in early.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.100]   Absolutely.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.100]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.020]   So we're talking about traditional finance, traditional investing.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.220]   I'll deviate for a moment from crypto and ask, you've been in this industry.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:24.220]   Are there things, hacks, optimizations when it comes to investing that you think people
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.460]   should be thinking about outside of crypto?
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.900]   I'm a big fan of Wealthfront.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:36.100]   I basically, outside of crypto, have a part of my portfolio that's just diversified across
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.980]   stocks and bonds and auto-rebalanced, and I do all of that on Wealthfront.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:45.540]   I have a part of it where I more actively invest in tech stocks and do other things,
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.540]   which I'll talk about.
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.340]   And then I do a little bit in private equity and real estate.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:55.580]   One of the things that I think, if people have the time and the inclination, can be
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:01.340]   really valuable and is a total hack, is just getting comfortable with options and learning
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:12.220]   how you can increase your returns from a position, either before you get into it or while you
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.420]   have it, just by selling options.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.020]   So I'll give you two examples.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:23.700]   If you've said to yourself, "I'd like to buy X, Y, Z stock," one thing you could do is
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.340]   just go buy it.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:30.420]   Another thing you could do is you could sell a put at or above the current price that the
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:35.860]   stock is trading at, and then you collect a premium, so you're basically decreasing
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:41.900]   your cost basis on the stock by getting into owning it that way instead of just buying
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.900]   it outright.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.900]   And just for someone who doesn't know what a put is, when you're selling a put, what
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:47.900]   are you doing?
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:56.280]   When you're selling a put, you are selling the right to someone else to deliver a stock
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.460]   to you at the price on the put.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:03.700]   So I can say, "I want to buy Amazon stock."
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.640]   And I could say, "I want to buy it at this price."
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.780]   And someone will actually pay me to say, "In the future, I want to buy it."
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:12.780]   Exactly.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.780]   Instead of me buying it, I can get paid and then buy it later.
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.860]   Do you always get to buy it?
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.500]   Is it only if the price goes up or down?
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.500]   There's a little bit of nuance there.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:30.340]   You're giving up the certainty of owning it now is basically what you're giving up.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:37.220]   So let's say Amazon is trading at $100 and you want to sell the put at $105.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:43.540]   So there's probably a pretty good chance that as long as Amazon doesn't go up above $105
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:49.780]   between today and the expiration of the option that you're going to end up buying it.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.260]   And you might get paid for selling that Amazon put at $105, $7.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:29:00.380]   Your effective cost basis on the Amazon stock, assuming you get ownership of it, would be
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.380]   like $98 instead of $100.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.460]   So you've got a deal just by giving up the need to get it right now.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.460]   Exactly.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.500]   You're basically using time and volatility and your willingness as a market participant
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:18.540]   to be a certain kind of way for a long period of time up.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:23.100]   And someone else who might be more, they might be looking to hedge or they might be a little
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.740]   bit of a faster mover in the markets, they're paying you for that optionality that you're
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:28.740]   giving them.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.380]   And then similarly, once you own stocks, you can sell out of the money calls on them and
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.940]   you give up a little bit of the upside, but you also create some income.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:41.580]   And as long as you do these things in the right way, based on your objectives, I think
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:47.500]   people can pick up an extra 5% to 15% a year on top of whatever their general portfolio
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.220]   performance would have been.
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:54.580]   And for the second example, that would be, I own a stock, I want to sell it, but I'm
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.820]   not going to sell it today.
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.140]   I'm going to sell a call that means somebody can buy it from me in the future.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:05.660]   And by letting that time go on, I get a better price, or at least I get income now.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.580]   I might not get a better price in the future, but I'll get income now.
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.580]   Exactly.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:14.900]   So let's say you work at a company that went public and you're holding a ton of company
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.500]   stock and you're like, I want to get rid of this over the next 12 months or some of it.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.060]   You could just be earning money while you're waiting.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.720]   And unless you have an urgent need to sell it today, this could just be like a passive
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.820]   income stream.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.020]   Sell the calls all day.
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.300]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.540]   Anything else in that space?
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.540]   Wealthfront's a great hack.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.980]   I used to play the points game.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.860]   There's so much stuff you can do with a good credit score.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.580]   Maybe the big hack is just focus on getting a good credit score if you don't have one
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.580]   yet.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.500]   And then you can monetize that in all kinds of ways over time.
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.500]   Yeah.
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.500]   I was blown away.
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:49.100]   I drove a car that was a 2003 for almost 12, 15 years, and then I was like, oh, I got to
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.100]   buy a new car.
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.100]   And things had changed.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.460]   I was like, wow, if you have a good credit score, maybe the car manufacturer has a great
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.120]   deal right now where it's 0% financing if you have a good credit score.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.940]   Even not, I shopped all these local credit unions, and I want to say three, four years
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:10.340]   ago, we ended up getting like 0.99% APR, which is an interest rate that I don't even know
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.860]   how that's possible, but I know that they had credit score tiers, and if you didn't
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.900]   get the right credit score, you were getting a much worse rate.
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:17.900]   Focus on your credit score.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.220]   If you're out there, you're under the age of 25, and you haven't figured this one out
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.700]   yet, just create a Credit Karma account, know what your credit score is, and do the stuff
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.260]   you need to do to get north of 680.
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.260]   Yeah.
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:33.060]   I just want to thank you, Kwik, for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.820]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.880]   You mentioned earlier you had this blog where you were sharing all these ideas before you
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.360]   started BlockFi, things like fractional real estate.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.600]   Anything back then that you thought was really interesting that you ever thought, gosh, why
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.720]   is no one picking up on this?
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.720]   This is so cool.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.820]   I mean, buying crypto was a big one.
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.440]   This was back in 2014, so I was like, more people should be buying Bitcoin.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.440]   I also wrote about a thing on there.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.920]   This is kind of more of a novelty at this point, but it was called Billshark, and basically
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:17.200]   it's these people that you could pay to call the phone and cable company on your behalf
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.640]   and just tell them you needed a better deal, and they would take 20% of however much they
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.640]   saved you or something.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.640]   I thought that was hilarious.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.640]   I don't think it's around anymore.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.240]   It's probably not around anymore.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.240]   No, no.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.360]   There's a company out there.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.920]   I think Billshark might still be around.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.160]   I think there's a company called Trim that does this.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.680]   I'll put a link to whatever the right company is in the show notes and everything else we've
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.680]   talked about.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.340]   But this is a thing, and if you want to take the time to do it, you can call Comcast every
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.600]   12 months and say, "Hey, I'm going to leave if you don't give me a better price," and
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.720]   that you could do that.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:49.720]   Or there's companies that will do it, and not only will they save you the time, but
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.880]   you have to assume that someone who's living is calling Comcast to get a better deal, knows
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.380]   how to do it better than you do.
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.360]   So it's just, what do you want to spend time in your life, and what do you want to outsource
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.440]   so you don't have to think about it?
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.440]   I think that's it.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.320]   I think those are the biggest things.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:08.200]   To come back briefly to crypto, you mentioned you used to play the points game, and you
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.560]   guys have a credit card coming out.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.680]   I know because I've been doing everything I can to move up the list.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.240]   Can you talk a little bit about that?
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.240]   Yeah, sure.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.760]   We're launching the world's first Bitcoin rewards credit card.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.160]   It's going to start rolling out this quarter to folks on the waiting list, and the card
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:31.440]   has a 1.5% base cash back rate on every purchase, which we automatically convert to Bitcoin
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.200]   and move into your BlockFi account where you can earn interest on a trade and get a loan
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.080]   secured by it, et cetera.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:43.680]   In addition to that base cash back rate, we're giving folks a 3.5% cash back rate for one
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   quarter in their first year, and there are other benefits on our platform for cardholders.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.040]   So cardholders will earn an extra 2%.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.920]   On their stable coin balances at BlockFi, they'll get a rebate on any trading volume
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:04.120]   that they do of 25 bips, and they also get a higher refer a friend bonus of $50 instead
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.840]   of the normal 20 for anyone that they tell about BlockFi.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.600]   So we're really excited about it.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:16.080]   We think that there's a lot of folks that have bought Bitcoin and become very excited
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.600]   by it who just want ways to earn more.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.600]   All the time.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.440]   That's the thesis for this show is, "I'm on this quest.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.640]   All I want is more.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.160]   How do I get the most out of spending?
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.120]   How do I get the most out of savings?"
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.200]   And look, if this card would have been out at any point in time in the past, and you
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.080]   were earning Bitcoin, you would have earned way more in rewards at the end of the day
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:42.800]   by just auto-converting it into Bitcoin, and then on top of that, getting interest on the
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.240]   Bitcoin in your BlockFi account than any other rewards card.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.880]   It would blow everything else completely out of the water in terms of value that you get.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:56.440]   But we also think it's an exciting moment for the industry, another part of this mega-trend
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.640]   of integration into the traditional financial system and more people getting access, and
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:05.400]   we think it's a product that will hopefully reduce the risk and complexity of someone
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.120]   that hasn't bought any Bitcoin yet getting their hands on Bitcoin for the first time
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.680]   in a way that they're familiar with.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.280]   Just about everyone, if you don't, you're living under a rock.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.880]   Everyone knows how to earn rewards on a credit card.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.040]   And so it's a really familiar and unintimidating way to get some Bitcoin.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:27.720]   I think one thing I regret, I searched my history before this for all my emails from
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:33.480]   Coinbase, and I looked back and I was like, "Man, in 2013, I bought 30 Bitcoins?"
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:39.360]   And then I'm like, "Ooh, in 2014, I also sold 29 Bitcoins!"
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.260]   And I felt like a hero making 30% return in one year.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:48.120]   And then throughout the years, I found random ways to buy things for fun with Bitcoin, and
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.860]   I never replenished it.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:55.400]   And so it just seemed like it never made sense to go buy $5 of Bitcoin today, $50 of Bitcoin
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.400]   tomorrow.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.080]   So the thing I'm really interested in this card is it automates something that you want
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.320]   to do, but you don't want to think about every day.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.080]   And I think it would be really cool, whatever you want to save in.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:09.480]   Obviously, this isn't what you're building, but if you could just automatically have all
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:15.360]   of your excess cash, excess savings, credit card points, go into some predetermined formula
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.680]   that, "I want to every month buy $100 of Bitcoin.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.100]   I want to save $20 towards this vacation.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.480]   I want to put $200 towards my kid's college fund."
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:29.640]   I recently launched a service at Wealthfront called Autopilot, where you can automatically
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.480]   save to all these destinations.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:36.040]   It would be so cool if you could tap that in, do it over the blockchain, save to whatever
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.520]   you want, whether it's crypto or a college fund.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.200]   That's my dream credit card.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.000]   But this seems to be the first credit card that comes close, and I'm very excited to
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.360]   be high on the wait list.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:51.600]   Hearing you talk, it made me think of that expression from Dollar Shave Club, "Shave
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.360]   money, shave time."
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.080]   I think at the end of the day, that's what it's ultimately all about.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.280]   There's stuff you can do in the financial world and with hacks for fun, but I think
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:09.440]   we all hit certain points in our life, or just in general, have a desire to reduce complexity
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:17.120]   and just set things up, know that it's running, and not have to think about it or take action
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.160]   to keep whatever plan you're doing in motion.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.160]   And I think that that type of tool that you just described is fantastic.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.040]   It's clearly a big hack.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.040]   You just got to get the Bitcoin allocation in there.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.040]   I know.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.720]   I mean, automation is such a hack, the more people that have to wait every month and decide
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.440]   to save versus set it on recurring transfers.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.840]   I know that's something you guys support.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.760]   I can make recurring buys.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.400]   And if you want to invest in Bitcoin and you don't want to think about it, you could just
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.960]   set that up.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.960]   Precisely.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.800]   So we talked about Bitcoin a lot.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.880]   We talked about crypto as a category.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.480]   There's all these other things.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   Outside of Stablecoin, there's Ethereum, and there's just millions of other coins with
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.920]   totally different names, some that sound like toys, some that sound like a kid's game,
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.480]   some that sound more serious.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.840]   Dogecoin has been wild in the news.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.880]   People have been talking about it like it's the craziest thing.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.760]   When you talk about crypto and you talk about investing in the market, are you talking about
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   Bitcoin?
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.800]   Are you talking about everything else?
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.920]   How should someone think about all the things as they're thinking about it as a place to
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.760]   invest, as a place to explore?
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.040]   Yeah, look, there's a lot going on in the crypto world.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:26.240]   The mental model that I have for things is that you've got the store of value kind of
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:33.520]   Bitcoin category of crypto, and there's Bitcoin, which is the clear leader in a couple copycats.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:38.960]   You've got a category of protocols, which was really started by Ethereum, and the idea
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:44.140]   there is that you can make a blockchain a little bit more like an iPhone, where there's
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.560]   also a capacity to build apps on top of it.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.160]   And you've got a whole category of folks like that.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.660]   And then you're also starting to see, as a subcategory, some of the first applications
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.580]   that are really catching on, and that's where things like NFTs are coming from.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.600]   But when I think of crypto and the investment opportunities that come from it, I would think
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:08.080]   of buying Ethereum tokens as a play on that adoption that these applications that are
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.200]   built on top of Ethereum are going to get.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:15.240]   And then you have a third category, which is like traditional assets being tokenized.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.020]   And in that third category, the big thing today is stablecoins.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:21.920]   There's really two interesting things you can do with stablecoins.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.680]   One is use them as a vehicle to earn a yield, a really safe yield in this crypto world that
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.840]   doesn't have access to bank financing yet.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:35.360]   And then the other thing is you can make cross-border payments dramatically more easily than you
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:40.720]   can using the traditional system, because in crypto land, there's no concept of, "Oh,
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.240]   there's a border here in between the US and Mexico."
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:47.360]   It's just like the email just goes through when you send it to someone else.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.920]   So those are the three buckets.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.760]   My personal crypto portfolio is as follows.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:40:03.740]   I have 90% Bitcoin, seven, maybe 8% Ethereum, and then I own a little bit of Solana, which
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:07.880]   is basically the up-and-coming Ethereum competitor.
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.380]   So you've got a hedge.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.240]   If Ethereum doesn't work out, you've got the backup.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.400]   It's a little bit of a hedge, but it's all about risk tolerance.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:22.880]   I haven't done anything with Dogecoin or NFTs because I'm not really a meme stock, time
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.720]   the markets kind of person.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:30.920]   I like buying stuff that I can have a long-term view on and not put myself in a position where
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.840]   I might feel like I need to day trade it.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.840]   That's what I do.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:39.360]   And I think one interesting thing was if you were around 20 years ago and saw what was
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.400]   going on with the internet, and you're like, "Wow, this is the future.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.400]   I think everything will be online."
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:49.320]   There was not an easy way to make an obvious bet on, "I'm going to invest in the internet."
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.440]   There wasn't an option.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.300]   What's happening on Ethereum, the kinds of software getting built on top of it and programs,
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:02.640]   is buying Ethereum, the token, effectively a way to bet on that whole network being the
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.280]   way we do lots of things on the internet?
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.280]   But similar to how mobile brought about this whole world of apps and everything, and can
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.720]   the blockchain with Ethereum do that?
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:17.880]   And if so, is buying Ethereum tokens the way to bet on things in the future happening on
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:18.880]   the blockchain?
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:19.880]   I think so.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.760]   I think it's the best way I can think of.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:29.080]   I don't know of a better way to holistically express that view than buying Ethereum.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:35.920]   Ethereum is like oil meets stock in the company that makes the network, but it's definitely
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.040]   not stock, and it's also not precisely oil.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:44.900]   So it's in between those two things, but I do think it would be the thing to buy if
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:51.360]   you want to express a view with an investment that, yes, these applications built on top
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.080]   of blockchain networks are going to continue to expand and gain adoption.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.880]   I think Ethereum is the way to play that.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.880]   Yep.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.900]   And I think that's something that a lot of trends people see, there's not an easy way
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.900]   to bet on them.
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:08.000]   If you thought mobile was cool, yeah, you could bet on Apple, but who knew that there'd
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.280]   be all these companies that are monetizing these apps, and Instagram would be huge, and
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.360]   WhatsApp would be huge.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:18.680]   There's too many things to bet on, and this is one of the first times in my kind of career/life
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.060]   that I've said, "Wow, this thing I think could be really powerful," and there's actually
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:27.980]   a way that a regular person could invest $1 in, and you don't have to be a venture capitalist
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:31.980]   to invest in the company, and I think who knows what the future holds, but the sheer
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.600]   fact that you can participate in it with any amount of money I think is something that
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.720]   hasn't happened in the past, and I'm pretty excited about.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.000]   It's really, really powerful, and I would add, globally.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.680]   It's not just America, China, Europe, Africa, like, literally, this thing is open like the
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:53.560]   internet, and so I think that's also really powerful, and frequently underestimated because
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:59.660]   we're so used to just thinking of things in our US-centric view, or folks in other countries
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.520]   are used to thinking about their market, but this is really a global market, so that's
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.520]   pretty powerful.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.360]   Yeah, I think that's amazing.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.360]   Thank you so much for joining me.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:12.320]   Where can people find out more about you and BlockFi online?
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.320]   Thanks for having me, Chris.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.320]   We're pretty easy to find.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.800]   BlockFi.com is our website.

[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:30.400]   I'm usually pretty good about responding to DMs, and I also like hearing from folks personally,
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.880]   so don't hesitate to follow me or shoot me a note on Twitter.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.880]   Cool.
