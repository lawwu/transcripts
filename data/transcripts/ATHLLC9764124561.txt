[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Hey everyone, since recording this episode, a lot has happened with crypto and specifically
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.520]   BlockFi.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.720]   I'm recording this on the morning of November 15, 2022, and after the downfall of the crypto
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.920]   exchange FTX, BlockFi put a hold on all customer withdrawals, leaving many people, myself included,
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.120]   with a lot of crypto on the platform.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.400]   I am angry about the way this was all handled and communicated, and certainly not happy
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.080]   about the financial situation they've put me and many others in.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.480]   I truly hope that they're able to find a way through all of this that results in everyone
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.920]   getting back their money, so obviously any recommendation you might hear for BlockFi
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.320]   in this episode should be ignored and considered outdated.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.560]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.100]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much more,
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.600]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which actually gets
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.720]   harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.360]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.860]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in everything
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.360]   from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.580]   I'm a member of Longangle, I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.860]   one of the founders, Tad Fallows, join me on All the Hacks in episode 87 to talk about
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.680]   alternative investments.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.480]   Now the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly successful
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.840]   individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn from each other in a confidential,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.320]   unbiased setting.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.040]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.800]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community because you're
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.760]   getting advice and feedback from people in a similar situation to you on everything from
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.200]   your investment portfolio, to your children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.660]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online, so if you have more
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.800]   than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their minimum for membership, I encourage
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.640]   you to check out Longangle, and it's totally free to join.

[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.920]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E dot com.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:29.200]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All the Hacks, a show about upgrading your
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.720]   life, money, and travel, all while spending less and saving more.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.920]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and today I'm talking to Zach Prince, the co-founder and CEO of
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   BlockFi.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.800]   If you don't know BlockFi, they're a crypto-first banking platform where you can earn interest,
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.020]   borrow cash, and trade crypto all in one place.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.480]   In our conversation, we not only discuss crypto things like earning 8.6% on your cash and
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.480]   how to think about holding crypto in your overall investment portfolio, but we also
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.160]   discuss Zach's favorite investing hacks, like how to use options to generate income.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.120]   And before we jump in, if you're enjoying the show, I'd really love your help.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.480]   If you could either pick your favorite episode and share it with a friend or leave a five-star
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.820]   review in the podcast app, I would really appreciate it.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.640]   All right, let's get to it.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.600]   Well, after one more quick thing.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.560]   Chris Hutchins works at Wealthfront.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.800]   All opinions expressed by Chris and his guests are solely their own opinions and do not reflect
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.640]   the opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.680]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for investment
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680]   decisions.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   Zach, thanks for joining.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.320]   Chris, pumped to be here, man.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.320]   I'm excited to talk about hacks.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.440]   So before we jump in, could you give everyone a little background on yourself?
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.000]   How did you end up running BlockFi?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Yeah, sure.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.200]   I grew up in Texas and moved to New York City after I finished school.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.880]   I've always worked at venture-backed technology companies.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.680]   I was originally in the advertising technology sector and more recently, I've been in the
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.120]   fintech sector at a couple of online lending businesses prior to starting BlockFi.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.280]   While I was at one of those online lending businesses, I got a ton of exposure to all
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   things fintech.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.680]   We were kind of like a data aggregator and technology provider and so I just saw so many
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.720]   interesting things happening in the ecosystem and I started writing a blog about whether
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.080]   or not people should be using robo-advisors or whether or not you should be investing
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.360]   in fractionalized real estate and nobody ever read it and podcasts weren't a thing yet,
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.080]   so I didn't have a cool podcast platform.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.880]   But that experience led me to Bitcoin for the first time and I was basically yelling
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.440]   on this blog back in 2014 that just from a risk-return perspective, you should be buying
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.160]   a little bit of Bitcoin if you were young and had any amount of risk tolerance because
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.800]   it could potentially do 100x.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   And unfortunately, that kind of came true in early 2017 on the momentum of excitement
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.440]   from the price appreciation, I decided that I really wanted to get involved in the crypto
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.540]   space full-time and that desire led me to the idea for BlockFi, which originally was
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.360]   to build debt and credit products for the crypto ecosystem.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.320]   And we've, from that starting point, expanded to where we are today, which I would describe
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.960]   as crypto-first banking solutions or crypto-first wealth management solutions, but yeah, that's
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   how we got here.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   So what made me reach out was I opened up a BlockFi interest account and right now,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.360]   interest rates are kind of at all-time lows and kind of give people an idea of what it
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   is.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.360]   Yeah, sure.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.760]   And it's 8.6% in an account that's liquid.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.480]   So you can go in and out in a 48-hour window if you want, which is very different than
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.440]   a lot of other kind of online lending or private credit opportunities where sure, you might
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.860]   be able to get high single-digit yields, but you're dealing with something that's illiquid
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.760]   or on a much longer duration than the BlockFi interest account.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.120]   But the way it came about is we started originally with our first product, which is enabling
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.560]   people to borrow dollars secured by the value of their cryptocurrency.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.720]   And launching and starting to scale that product led us to the realization that there was a
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:22.320]   lot of borrowing demand for cryptocurrencies in the marketplace because prime brokers weren't
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.680]   supporting big trading firms that were getting active in the crypto market.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.200]   And so we started lending cryptocurrencies to these big institutions and then we needed
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.160]   more and so we launched the interest account, initially just offering a yield on Bitcoin,
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.200]   Ethereum, and a couple of other cryptocurrencies.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.420]   But then we quickly expanded that to include stablecoins, which are one-to-one interchangeable
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.960]   with dollars in a bank account.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.560]   And now using the interest account, folks can get a high yield on all of those assets.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:58.760]   So it's a 5% on Bitcoin, 4.5% on Ethereum, 8.6% on stablecoins, which are interchangeable
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.160]   one-to-one with dollars in a bank account.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.600]   And the reason, often, the first question we get from folks who are like, "You're paying
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.800]   me 8.6% on cash, this is insane, why is this even possible?"
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.080]   Well, the fundamental reason why this is possible is that banks aren't active in the crypto
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.080]   space yet.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.600]   The crypto space has experienced a ton of growth, there's been a ton of wealth creation,
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.920]   and there's also a lot of volatility.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:31.040]   And all of those things combine to create a pretty large market of borrowing demand.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.280]   And because banks are not actively lending into this space, and in general, the crypto
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.760]   world doesn't have access to traditional sources of capital, the cost of borrowing is high.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.720]   And what we're doing with the BlockFi interest account is basically giving folks a really
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:55.360]   easy, seamless way to take advantage of that market dynamic and earn 8.6% on your cash,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.360]   even if you don't want to buy Bitcoin.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.000]   And then you can also, of course, buy Bitcoin on our platform and earn interest on that
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   as well.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   But that's how it works.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.520]   If anyone's used a fintech platform, they'll feel very familiar with how things work at
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.520]   BlockFi.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.080]   You go through a quick KYC process, connect your bank account using Plaid, transfer some
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.160]   money in, and then the next morning you'll see your accrued interest, and once a month
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.160]   the interest becomes part of your balance.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.520]   And it's a relatively straightforward user experience.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.200]   There's a lot of fancy stuff that goes on in the background in terms of how the lending
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.720]   works and the risk management.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.880]   I'm really happy to say that we've never lost a penny across any of the lending that we
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.880]   do at BlockFi.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.200]   It's a very low risk type of lending where we're getting collateral for every loan that
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.320]   we're making on the platform.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.960]   Yeah, that's the interest account.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.400]   Yeah, I can attest to an easy process.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.200]   I've signed up, I've put cash in there, and I've earned interest each month at a much
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   higher rate.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.960]   I think in the finance industry, there's always this trade-off that everyone talks about of
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.960]   risk and reward.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.200]   8.6% is a lot.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.720]   Can you talk about the risks that someone might take putting money here versus leaving
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.240]   it in a bank account earning almost nothing?
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.560]   Yeah, there is a very important disclaimer, which is this is not a bank account, and as
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.840]   a result, it does not come with FDIC insurance.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.800]   It's also not a securities account with CIPIC insurance.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.600]   This is really from a, where does this fit in the spectrum of investing?
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:28.320]   I think it's closest to private credit opportunities or maybe real estate financing platforms.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:35.040]   But the risk, in my mind, is much lower because similar to real estate, you're participating
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.120]   in something where there's an asset that's being provided as collateral for the loan.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.940]   The big difference is just that the asset that we're financing at BlockFi and folks
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.920]   who are holding dollars on our platform are financing is a liquid asset.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.320]   So you're basically taking part in a system that lends folks 50 cents on the dollar secured
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.000]   by their Bitcoin, and then BlockFi manages all of the risk management related to that
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.140]   in terms of if the Bitcoin price goes down, we're issuing margin calls or selling a little
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.080]   bit of the Bitcoin to make sure that there aren't any losses.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.720]   So can you just dive one level deeper?
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.520]   So if I'm putting money in my BlockFi interest account, you're loaning that money out, you
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.500]   said it's collateralized, like 50 cents on the dollar, somewhere in that ballpark.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.960]   That means that someone borrowing has to put more money in than they're actually borrowing
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.000]   in dollars or in stablecoin?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.600]   And you can actually see this dynamic within your BlockFi account.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:35.040]   So in the same account where you can earn 8.6%, if you're holding dollars in the account
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.680]   as stablecoins, you can also access our loans product where if you borrow dollars at a 50%
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:46.640]   LTV relative to your Bitcoin, so let's say you have one Bitcoin, it's around $55,000.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:52.840]   So you could borrow up to $27,500 secured by that one Bitcoin.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.800]   You would pay roughly 10% for that.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.720]   What we're doing is charging one side 10, paying the other side 8.6, and then also managing
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.240]   a lot of just liquidity and kind of portfolio level risk.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.440]   So for every $100 that comes in and is held in an interest account, we're not lending
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.960]   out 100, we're lending out 70 or 80.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.560]   And the reason for that is that you want to make sure that you always have ample liquidity
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.480]   in the system to process withdrawals or originate new loans.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.480]   And so there's a bit of, you know, complexity behind the scenes, but fundamentally that's
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.480]   how it works.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.840]   And is your system fully automated such that if Bitcoin at three in the morning starts
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.740]   going down and the interest account holders are all worried, what's going to happen?
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:42.080]   Are you able to sell the assets that you have on collateral in real time or as things are
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.840]   falling if you need to, obviously you don't want to, but if you need to protect the people
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.840]   that have interest accounts?
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.840]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.000]   I mean, that's one of the unique things about the crypto market.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.360]   I think one of the products that's relatively analogous to our loan product would be a margin
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.280]   account for securities or a securities backed loan where you have a bunch of shares of Amazon
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.120]   stock and you don't want to sell them.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.040]   You borrow against the value of those shares.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.720]   If Amazon stock goes down in value at a certain point, you're going to get a margin call from
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.480]   that broker that gave you the loan.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.560]   The big difference is that in crypto, the market trades 24/7.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:27.940]   So our system runs 24/7 and in that scenario where the price is falling at 3am, our system's
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.920]   working at 3am and it can issue margin calls and sell Bitcoin if it needs to.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:38.240]   In the traditional market scenario, it's a little bit more risky in some ways because
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:44.180]   what happens is the market closes, Amazon releases earnings and whether those based
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.920]   on how those earnings do, and Amazon's a really large cap stock, so probably not the
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.920]   best example, but it releases earnings after hours, liquidity's thin.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.880]   Let's say there's a big surprise up or down.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.140]   By the time the market opens the next day, you might have gapped down pretty significantly
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.080]   by the time you can actually sell or do anything again.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.080]   In crypto, it just runs 24/7.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.720]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.960]   Now, in part of my diligence, and again, full disclosure, I'm a BlockFi customer, I noticed
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:15.200]   there are lots of other companies out there doing various versions of taking a stablecoin
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.480]   and earning return.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.200]   Is there something different that BlockFi does that people should keep in mind if they're
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.440]   considering all of the alternatives?
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:30.800]   BlockFi is the only company that offers this type of functionality in the crypto ecosystem
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:36.420]   that is available to retail investors, domiciled and regulated in the US.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:42.320]   So we're regulated like a fintech company, we have numerous licenses across the US.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:49.320]   And that is led by a team of financial services professionals who come from precisely the
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:54.280]   backgrounds that you would want folks to come from if they're managing a platform like ours.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.080]   If you get into the crypto world, there can be spectrums of shadiness, for lack of a better
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080]   term.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:06.780]   And there are some folks out there who cosmetically might look the same as BlockFi, offering you
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.220]   an interest rate on a certain asset.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.380]   But they did an ICO, which was effectively an illegal securities offering, and they're
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.620]   domiciled in some foreign jurisdiction that doesn't have as strong of a rule of laws as
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.620]   the US.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.940]   And then the last thing I would say is just our track record, we really invented a lot
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.860]   of this stuff in this market, we've been doing it the longest, and we've had perfect performance
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.660]   for our clients throughout our entire history.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:37.500]   Within the crypto lending world, I would say that it's a very reasonable assessment to
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.620]   make that BlockFi is the safest bet for this type of activity.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:48.780]   And then the last thing I would add is that we really pride ourselves on providing world-class
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.780]   client service.
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:57.180]   And so there'll never be a scenario with BlockFi where if you have a question or a concern,
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.260]   or you want to get in touch with us about anything, that you won't be able to really
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.260]   quickly.
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:06.860]   We have a phone number and really great response times on chat and email as well.
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.300]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.300]   emerge.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.220]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week, and you have too many manual processes,
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.420]   and there's no one source of truth.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:25.260]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,000, 25, 1.
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:30.380]   37,000, that's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle, and I'm
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.180]   excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.060]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting, financial
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.100]   management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.900]   25, NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:48.260]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in days, not
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.860]   weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.820]   And one, because your business is one of a kind, so you get a customized solution for
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:00.820]   all your KPIs in one efficient system with one source of truth.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.060]   Manage risk, get reliable forecasts, and improve margins.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.860]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the companies
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.780]   I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.700]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.300]   for you, and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.340]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.220]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:56.400]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold-extracted, using only wild-harvested leaves from 250-year-old
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.860]   tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.900]   Then everything is triple-toxin-screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic mold
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.960]   commonly found in plants.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:13.380]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero-prep, because they're all in pre-measured quantities
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:18.460]   that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds, and are so travel-friendly.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:23.060]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-erh
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:27.740]   for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-erh, which helps kick-start digestion and
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:32.820]   metabolism with a rich, earthy flavor that is so good, and probably one of my favorite
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.180]   things to drink.
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.780]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed benefits of
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:42.660]   polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be happy that
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.260]   Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.180]   But you don't even have to take my word, or do any research, because Peak offers free
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.820]   U.S. shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:18:00.460]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:06.500]   at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.300]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:16.260]   Yeah, I've heard people talking about how, "Oh, the rate might be higher with all these
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.260]   DeFi platforms."
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.760]   I assume that none of those come with customer service and liquidity and the structure and
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.100]   security of a company that's regulated in a modern first-world country.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.100]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.900]   And the rate is actually not higher unless you prescribe value to the tokens that are
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.260]   created by the DeFi protocol.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:40.740]   The actual yield on your stablecoin will be much lower than 8.6%, but then these protocols
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.620]   created their own token, and they give you some of that token as rewards.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.060]   And if you go and sell that, then maybe your all-in yield becomes higher.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.460]   And I'm a big fan of DeFi.
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:55.380]   I wouldn't want to say anything negative about DeFi whatsoever, but there are some big differences,
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.100]   especially in times of market stress.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:02.520]   And in times of market stress, companies like BlockFi have the ability to do things with
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.100]   our customers' interests at heart.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:09.660]   We're structured in a way where our equity capital, which is very substantial, would
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.940]   take the first loss if there ever were any losses.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.900]   And that's very different than a DeFi protocol.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.940]   What's happened in times of market volatilities with some of these DeFi protocols is, whoops,
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.780]   the smart contract failed and everybody with a loan got liquidated, or people that were
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.300]   depositing had to take a haircut, and nobody cares.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.420]   That sucks for you, Mr. Customer.
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.340]   That's just the polar opposite of how we view the world at BlockFi.
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.340]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.740]   And you said you guys have a lot of equity capital.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:41.660]   Can you give me a sense of how big is BlockFi the company right now, either from a fundraising,
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.540]   valuation, employees perspective?
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.540]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.820]   So we're actually over 700 people now at the company.
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:53.980]   The most recent round of funding that we did was a $350 million Series D that was led by
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.420]   Tiger Global and DST and Bain Capital Ventures.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:07.020]   And that round was done about six months after our Series C, which was a $150 million round
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.620]   that closed in Q3 of last year.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.940]   So we've been on a great fundraising trajectory.
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.000]   We haven't had anyone tell us we're wrong.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.220]   My co-founder has claimed that we're the fastest in-tech company to go from zero to a $3 billion
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.220]   valuation.
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.420]   So we're very fortunate and we've done really well in capital markets and just in terms
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.580]   of being able to build a large business really quickly.
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:35.740]   We talked a lot about the interest on stablecoin, something that's dollar-denominated and easily
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:41.140]   liquid, but holding another asset is part of an investment strategy.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.180]   And I think it, while it might not seem like a hack, putting my money to work over the
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:50.820]   last 10, 15 years of savings has been how I saved all the money I have.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.300]   And that's my investment portfolio.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.120]   That's a big hack for me is just putting money in a market that earns.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.300]   Given the state of crypto, an emerging asset class, how do you think about that as part
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.620]   of someone's investment portfolio?
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:07.680]   I mean, look, obviously it's a very personal question and it depends a lot on where folks
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.860]   are in their life and what their risk tolerance is and all of those typical kind of personal
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.980]   finance factors.
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:21.460]   But for me as someone that is relatively young, fortunate to be successful in my day job and
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:27.380]   have enough discretionary kind of income to invest in things like crypto has been the
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.580]   best investment that I've ever made.
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:38.440]   And it started out as 5% of my personal asset allocation, but because of the performance
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.760]   and also increasing conviction that I've had in the asset class, especially after I got
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.680]   involved in it full time, it's around 50% of my asset allocation now.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:57.400]   And I think there are these kind of underlying trends in the crypto market that are, regardless
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:03.960]   of the day to day volatility of the market, Bitcoin can go up or down 10, 20% in a single
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   day.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.440]   But if you put that to the side for a second and you zoom out a little bit, this market
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.880]   has so much potential and I don't think that's changing anytime soon.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.920]   And so what I tell folks that I recommend with crypto is invest an amount that you're
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.920]   comfortable with.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.240]   Understand that you're making an investment for the long term.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:30.320]   You're not turning into a day trader that's going to buy more or sell it tomorrow, depending
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.940]   on which way the wind is blowing in the crypto market.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.440]   And you're probably going to be pretty happy.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:40.840]   I think there's a very small number of days that someone could have possibly invested
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   in Bitcoin and they're all probably in the last 45 days where you'd be down on it.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.280]   If you bought it six months ago, you're up.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.680]   If you bought it a year ago, you're up.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.560]   If you bought it two or three or four years ago, you're up a lot.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:58.880]   And Bitcoin in particular is one of these, in my opinion, genuinely unique assets because
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:06.660]   it is both a kind of store of value hedge against inflation like gold and a venture
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.240]   capital type growth play on a network.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:15.360]   And this is a network that is attracting new users, making more connections into traditional
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.160]   systems and garnering more adoption every single day.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:26.240]   And then there's a lot of other exciting things happening in crypto beyond Bitcoin.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.880]   But I think that thesis and then when you take that thesis and you just compare it to
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.520]   the TAM of some of the things that could be disrupted, it becomes clear that this is still
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.760]   very early innings.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.800]   And for me, those are the types of investments that I like.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.440]   Ultimately, I think what you want in an investment is something that has a really big upside
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.280]   and not too much downside.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.000]   I think Bitcoin kind of fits that mold perfectly.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.640]   Yeah, my day job, I work at Wealthfront.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.800]   We have an automated portfolio that we offer people to help them build their wealth.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.640]   And we recently announced that cryptocurrency is something we're exploring bringing onto
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.640]   the platform.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:06.080]   But when I talk to traditional financial planners and financial advisors, it seems like crypto
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.440]   is not something they're considering putting in the portfolios for their clients.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:17.840]   How far out are we from mainstream investment kind of practice being including this asset
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.840]   class?
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.240]   I think the key qualifier there is investment practice.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:28.760]   We're already well along the S-curve, I think, in terms of adoption of crypto.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:34.440]   It's hard to get perfect data, but there's estimates that 10 to 15 percent of Americans
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.440]   own cryptocurrency.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.340]   Well, only about half of Americans own investments.
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:45.960]   So out of your population that owns investments, you're already at 20 to 30 percent in the
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.960]   U.S.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.960]   And so that's not nothing.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:54.840]   That's not like a fringe thing off to the side that can just be completely written off.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:00.480]   The establishment of financial management infrastructure, whether you're talking about banks or private
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.560]   wealth groups or financial advisors, these things take time.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:09.760]   And I think that in 2017, we had a big run up, we had a lot of retail adoption, which
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:16.320]   is really cool because this thing really came about driven by retail, which is pretty unique.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.720]   And then it cooled off and everyone was like, oh, yeah, maybe it's dead.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.180]   Then COVID hit and Bitcoin went down a little bit.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:29.080]   But then COVID highlighted for us how everything that's digital is preferred to its analog
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:38.560]   counterpart and how stores of value that can potentially retain or increase in times where
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.900]   we have a rapidly expanding money supply are important to have in a diversified investment
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:43.900]   portfolio.
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.360]   And Bitcoin just nails it on both of those points.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:53.560]   So we come out of the financial craziness caused by COVID and Bitcoin does a 5x in six
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.480]   months and then everyone's like, OK, it's actually here.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.480]   This is very real.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:02.640]   So this is the first time that big institutions and the establishment is starting to say it's
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.640]   actually real.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:09.280]   And they're all in the process of figuring out how to integrate it into what they do.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.480]   You're seeing it with fintech companies like Square and PayPal and others.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.320]   I'm a Wealthfront user and I'm really excited for the day that I can either just automatically
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:23.600]   or based on some configuration have Bitcoin as part of my portfolio on Wealthfront.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.440]   I think we're going to get tremendous adoption on that.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:33.440]   And that's part of the underlying trend that's going to drive the ecosystem forward.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.080]   And ultimately, when you're dealing with something like Bitcoin, there's a finite supply.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.840]   And if you get more adoption, there's only one kind of market impact that can have, which
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:46.240]   is that the price will likely be higher in the future than it is today.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.640]   Do you think there's any truth to the idea that establishment finances, the traditional
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:56.400]   banks, they're not hyping and pushing and talking about crypto being part of everyone's
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.360]   portfolio because they're still a few years behind and being able to tap into the ecosystem
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.520]   themselves from a technology or infrastructure standpoint?
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.400]   I think that's the entirety of it.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.400]   It's like a switch flipped.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:12.960]   And as soon as there was a decision within some of the big banks that, yes, we are going
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:18.560]   to develop a crypto strategy, then the messaging flipped from, "Oh, this is a fraud and a scam.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.560]   Don't pay attention.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.560]   It's a bubble."
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.480]   The price target on Bitcoin is $400,000.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.720]   We're working on a product to put it in our private wealth management portfolios.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   Come talk to us in six months.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.480]   And that's literally happening in front of our eyes today.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.480]   No, that's it.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:39.260]   So, yeah, I think a hack is that you have these institutions that aren't necessarily
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:46.080]   publicly embracing it as much as they want to, but if you hear them in industry conversations,
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.080]   they're all in on it.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.880]   They have huge desks working on it.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.480]   So by the time they're tapped into the ecosystem, I have to assume they're going to be talking
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.200]   about it a lot more.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:01.880]   And if you're a part of something before that kind of a moment happens, it usually is good
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.280]   for the people that were in early.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.280]   Absolutely.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.240]   So we're talking about traditional finance, traditional investing.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.440]   I'll deviate for a moment from crypto and ask, you've been in this industry.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:16.460]   Are there things, hacks, optimizations when it comes to investing that you think people
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.680]   should be thinking about outside of crypto?
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.160]   I'm a big fan of Wealthfront.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:28.360]   I basically, outside of crypto, have a part of my portfolio that's just diversified across
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.360]   stocks and bonds and auto rebalanced, and I do all of that on Wealthfront.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.840]   I have a part of it where I more actively invest in tech stocks and do other things,
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.840]   which I'll talk about.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.600]   And then I do a little bit in private equity and real estate.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.840]   One of the things that I think, if people have the time and the inclination, can be
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.620]   really valuable and is a total hack, is just getting comfortable with options and learning
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:29:04.480]   how you can increase your returns from a position, either before you get into it or while you
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.700]   have it, just by selling options.
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.300]   So I'll give you two examples.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:16.160]   If you've said to yourself, "I'd like to buy XYZ stock," one thing you could do is just
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.160]   go buy it.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:22.720]   Another thing you could do is you could sell a put at or above the current price that the
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.840]   stock is trading at, and then you collect a premium.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:32.480]   So you're basically decreasing your cost basis on the stock by getting into owning it that
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.960]   way instead of just buying it outright.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   Similarly...
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.200]   And just for someone who doesn't know what a put is, when you're selling a put, what
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.200]   are you doing?
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:48.520]   When you're selling a put, you are selling the right to someone else to deliver a stock
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.700]   to you at the price on the put.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:55.960]   So I can say, "I want to buy Amazon stock."
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.880]   And I could say, "I want to buy it at this price."
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:04.000]   And someone will actually pay me to say, "In the future, I want to buy it."
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Exactly.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Instead of me buying it, I can get paid and then buy it later.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.120]   Do you always get to buy it?
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:15.760]   Is it only if the price goes up or down or what are you giving up?
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.480]   You're giving up the certainty of owning it now.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.620]   That's basically what you're giving up.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:29.520]   So let's say Amazon is trading at $100 and you want to sell the put at $105.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:35.800]   So there's probably a pretty good chance that as long as Amazon doesn't go up above $105
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:42.040]   between today and the expiration of the option, that you're going to end up buying it.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.520]   And you might get paid for selling that Amazon put at $105, $7.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:52.640]   Your effective cost basis on the Amazon stock, assuming you get ownership of it, would be
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.640]   like $98 instead of $100.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.760]   So you got a deal just by giving up the need to get it right now.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.760]   Exactly.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.760]   You're basically using time and volatility and your willingness as a market participant
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:10.800]   to be a certain kind of way for a long period of time up.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:15.360]   And someone else who might be more, they might be looking to hedge or they might be a little
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:20.040]   bit of a faster mover in the markets, they're paying you for that optionality that you're
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   giving them.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.560]   And then similarly, once you own stocks, you can sell out of the money calls on them and
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.280]   you give up a little bit of the upside, but you also create some income.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:33.840]   And as long as you do these things in the right way, based on your objectives, I think
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:39.760]   people can pick up an extra 5% to 15% a year on top of whatever their general portfolio
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.480]   performance would have been.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.320]   And for the second example, that would be, "I own a stock.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.080]   I want to sell it, but I'm not going to sell it today.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.400]   I'm going to sell a call that means somebody can buy it from me in the future.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:57.960]   And by letting that time go on, I get a better price, or at least I get income now.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.040]   I might not get a better price in the future, but I'll get income now."
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.040]   Exactly.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.160]   So let's say you work at a company that went public and you're holding a ton of company
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.280]   stock and you're like, "I want to get rid of this over the next 12 months or some of
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.280]   it."
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.360]   You could just be earning money while you're waiting.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.000]   And unless you have an urgent need to sell it today, this could just be like a passive
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.120]   income stream.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.320]   Sell the calls all day.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.560]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.840]   Anything else in that space?
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.840]   Wealthfront's a great hack.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.220]   I used to play the points game.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.120]   There's so much stuff you can do with a good credit score.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.840]   Maybe the big hack is just focus on getting a good credit score if you don't have one
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.840]   yet.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.800]   And then you can monetize that in all kinds of ways over time.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   I was blown away.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.240]   I drove a car that was a 2003 for almost 12, 15 years, and then I was like, "Oh, I got
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.240]   to buy a new car."
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.360]   And things had changed.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.760]   I was like, "Wow, if you have a good credit score, maybe the car manufacturer has a great
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.400]   deal right now where it's 0% financing if you have a good credit score."
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:56.200]   And not, I shopped all these local credit unions, and I want to say three, four years
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:02.600]   ago, we ended up getting 0.99% APR, which is an interest rate that I don't even know
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.120]   how that's possible, but I know that they had credit score tiers, and if you didn't
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.160]   get the right credit score, you were getting a much worse rate.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   Focus on your credit score.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.400]   If you're out there, you're under the age of 25, and you haven't figured this one out
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.960]   yet, just create a Credit Karma account, know what your credit score is, and do the stuff
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.920]   you need to do to get north of 680.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.280]   Let's do it.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:27.600]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact, and Trade Coffee is a great addition
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.960]   to your new year routine, and I am so excited to be partnering with them today.

[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.400]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it, and
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:06.520]   over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade, but this last bag of beans
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:12.600]   from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the Moon, and it's so delicious.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.800]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.

[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:38.320]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David Chang about leveling up your
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.700]   cooking at home?
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:44.720]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen, but one of his top hacks was using the microwave
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   more.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.840]   I have to admit, I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:54.440]   cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert, and I'm excited to partner with them for this
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.440]   episode.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.920]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from scratch in the
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:05.280]   microwave, and honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.880]   and simplifies the process so much.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:13.440]   The cookware is 100% plastic-free, and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat all in
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.200]   the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.680]   If you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly recommend
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.440]   David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.640]   It is so good.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:31.000]   If you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo collection they launched last year, you
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   have to check it out.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.800]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware, go to allthehacks.com/anyday.

[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.980]   I just want to thank you, Quick, for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.740]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.800]   You mentioned earlier you had this blog where you were sharing all these ideas before you
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.280]   started BlockFi, things like fractional real estate.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.520]   Anything back then that you thought was really interesting that you ever thought, "Gosh,
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.640]   why is no one picking up on this?
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.640]   This is so cool"?
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.760]   I mean, buying crypto was a big one.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.480]   This was back in 2014, so I was like, "Phew, more people should be buying Bitcoin."
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.360]   I also wrote about a thing on there.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.720]   This is kind of more of a novelty at this point, but it was called Billshark.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.560]   Basically, it's these people that you could pay to call the phone and cable company on
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:38.060]   your behalf and just tell them you needed a better deal, and they would take 20% of
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.760]   however much they saved you or something.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.760]   I thought that was hilarious.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   I don't think it's around anymore.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.760]   It's probably not around.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.760]   No, no.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.280]   There's a company out there.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.680]   I think Billshark might still be around.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.680]   Really?
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.120]   I think there's a company called Trim that does this.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.600]   I'll put a link to whatever the right company is in the show notes and everything else we've
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   talked about.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.280]   But this is a thing, and if you want to take the time to do it, you can call Comcast every
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.560]   12 months and say, "Hey, I'm going to leave if you don't give me a better price," and
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.680]   you could do that.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.640]   Or there's companies that will do it, and not only will they save you the time, but
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.840]   you have to assume that someone who's living is calling Comcast to get a better deal, knows
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.320]   how to do it better than you do.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.320]   So it's just what do you want to spend time in your life, and what do you want to outsource
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.360]   so you don't have to think about it?
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.360]   I think that's it.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.240]   I think those are the biggest things.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:25.160]   To come back briefly to crypto, you mentioned you used to play the points game, and you
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.480]   guys have a credit card coming out.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.600]   I know because I've been doing everything I can to move up the list.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.560]   Can you talk a little bit about that?
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.560]   Yeah, sure.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.720]   We're launching the world's first Bitcoin rewards credit card.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.680]   It's going to start rolling out this quarter to folks on the waiting list.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:47.120]   The card has a 1.5% base cash back rate on every purchase, which we automatically convert
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.960]   to Bitcoin and move into your BlockFi account where you can earn interest on a trade, get
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.000]   a loan secured by it, et cetera.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.600]   In addition to that base cash back rate, we're giving folks a 3.5% cash back rate for one
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:06.600]   quarter in their first year, and there are other benefits on our platform for cardholders.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:12.640]   So cardholders will earn an extra 2% on their stable coin balances at BlockFi.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:18.040]   They'll get a rebate on any trading volume that they do of 25 bips, and they also get
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:23.760]   a higher refer a friend bonus of $50 instead of the normal 20 for anyone that they tell
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.760]   about BlockFi.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.480]   So we're really excited about it.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:32.960]   We think that there's a lot of folks that have bought Bitcoin and become very excited
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:38.200]   by it, who just want ways to earn more all the time and integrate.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.320]   That's the thesis for this show is I'm on this quest.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.520]   All I want is more.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.040]   How do I get the most out of spending?
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.040]   How do I get the most out of savings?
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:51.200]   And look, if this card would have been out at any point in time in the past and you were
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:56.020]   earning Bitcoin, you would have earned way more in rewards at the end of the day by just
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.160]   auto-converting it into Bitcoin, and then on top of that, getting interest on the Bitcoin
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.960]   in your BlockFi account than any other rewards card.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:07.800]   It would blow everything else completely out of the water in terms of value that you get.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.720]   But we also think it's an exciting moment for the industry.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.840]   Another part of this mega trend of integration into the traditional financial system and
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.120]   more people getting access.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:22.320]   And we think it's a product that will hopefully reduce the risk and complexity of someone
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:27.040]   that hasn't bought any Bitcoin yet, getting their hands on Bitcoin for the first time
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.040]   in a way that they're familiar with.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.200]   Everyone, just about everyone, if you don't, you're living under a rock.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.800]   Everyone knows how to earn rewards on a credit card.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:39.080]   And so it's a really familiar and unintimidating way to get some Bitcoin.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:44.600]   I think one thing I regret, I searched my history before this for all my emails from
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:50.200]   Coinbase, and I looked back and I was like, "Man, in 2013, I bought 30 Bitcoins?"
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   Wow.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:56.300]   And then I'm like, "Ooh, in 2014, I also sold 29 Bitcoins."
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:00.200]   And I felt like a hero making 30% return in one year.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:05.040]   And then throughout the years, I found random ways to buy things for fun with Bitcoin, and
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.800]   I never replenished it.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:12.320]   And so it just seemed like it never made sense to go buy $5 of Bitcoin today, $50 of Bitcoin
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   tomorrow.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.040]   The other thing I'm really interested in this card is it automates something that you want
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.280]   to do, but you don't want to think about every day.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.960]   And I think it would be really cool, whatever you want to save in.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:26.440]   Obviously, this isn't what you're building, but if you could just automatically have all
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:32.320]   of your excess cash, excess savings, credit card points, go into some predetermined formula
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.600]   that, "I want to every month buy $100 of Bitcoin.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:39.040]   I want to save $20 towards this vacation.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.280]   I want to put $200 towards my kid's college fund.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.560]   I recently launched a service at Wealthfront called Autopilot where you can automatically
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.440]   save to all these destinations."
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.960]   It would be so cool if you could tap that in, do it over the blockchain, save to whatever
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.440]   you want, whether it's crypto or a college fund.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.120]   That's my dream credit card.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.960]   But this seems to be the first credit card that comes close, and I'm very excited to
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.240]   be high on the wait list.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:08.580]   Hearing you talk, it made me think of that expression from Dollar Shave Club, "Shave
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.320]   money, shave time."
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.040]   I think at the end of the day, that's what it's ultimately all about.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:18.160]   There's stuff you can do in the financial world and with hacks for fun, but I think
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:26.000]   we all hit certain points in our life or just in general have a desire to reduce complexity
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:34.040]   and just set things up, know that it's running, and not have to think about it or take action
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.120]   to keep whatever plan you're doing in motion.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.440]   And I think that that type of tool that you just described is fantastic.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.320]   It's clearly a big hack.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.040]   You just got to get the Bitcoin allocation in there.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.040]   I know.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.400]   But automation is such a hack.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.880]   The more people that have to wait every month and decide to save versus set it on recurring
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.880]   transfers.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.880]   I know that's something you guys support.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.700]   I can make recurring buys.
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.360]   And if you want to invest in Bitcoin and you don't want to think about it, you could just
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.000]   set that up.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Precisely.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.760]   So we talked about Bitcoin a lot.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.840]   We talked about crypto as a category.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.560]   There's all these other things outside of stablecoin.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.960]   There's Ethereum and there's just millions of other coins with totally different names.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.320]   Some that sound like toys, some that sound like a kid's game, some that sound more serious.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.760]   Dogecoin's been wild in the news.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:22.800]   People have been talking about it like it's the craziest thing.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.680]   When you talk about crypto and you talk about investing in the market, are you talking about
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   Bitcoin?
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.720]   Are you talking about everything else?
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.840]   How should someone think about all the things as they're thinking about it as a place to
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.800]   invest, as a place to explore?
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.960]   Yeah, look, there's a lot going on in the crypto world.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:44.360]   The mental model that I have for things is that you've got the store value kind of Bitcoin
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:50.480]   category of crypto, and there's Bitcoin, which is the clear leader in a couple copycats.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:55.880]   You've got a category of protocols, which was really started by Ethereum, and the idea
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:01.080]   there is that you can make a blockchain a little bit more like an iPhone, where there's
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.480]   also a capacity to build apps on top of it.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.080]   And you've got a whole category of folks like that.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.560]   And then you're also starting to see as a subcategory, some of the first applications
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.720]   that are really catching on.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.480]   And that's where things like NFTs are coming from.
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.480]   But when I think of crypto and the investment opportunities that come from it, I would think
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:25.000]   of buying Ethereum tokens as a play on that adoption that these applications that are
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.040]   built on top of Ethereum are going to get.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:32.160]   And then you have a third category, which is like traditional assets being tokenized.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.960]   And in that third category, the big thing today is stable coins.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.840]   There's really two interesting things you can do with stable coins.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:43.600]   One is use them as a vehicle to earn a yield, a really safe yield in this crypto world that
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.800]   doesn't have access to bank financing yet.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:52.280]   And then the other thing is you can make cross-border payments dramatically more easily than you
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:57.680]   can using the traditional system, because in crypto land, there's no concept of, oh,
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.200]   there's a border here in between the US and Mexico.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.240]   It's just like the email just goes through, you know, just goes through when you send
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.280]   it to someone else.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.840]   So those are the three buckets.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.640]   My personal crypto portfolio is as follows.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:20.640]   I have 90% Bitcoin, seven, maybe 8% Ethereum, and then I own a little bit of Solana, which
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.800]   is basically the up-and-coming Ethereum competitor.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   So if you-
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   Kind of hedge.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.080]   If Ethereum doesn't work out, you've got the backup.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.320]   It's a little bit of a hedge, but it's all about risk tolerance.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:39.800]   I haven't done anything with Dogecoin or NFTs because I'm not really a meme stock, time
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.640]   the markets kind of person.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.640]   I like buying stuff-
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.640]   Me either.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.840]   I like buying stuff that I can have a long-term view on and not put myself in a position where
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.760]   I might feel like I need to day trade it.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   That's what I do.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:56.320]   And I think one interesting thing was if you were around 20 years ago and saw what was
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:59.320]   going on with the internet and you're like, "Wow, this is the future.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:04.000]   I think everything will be online," there was not an easy way to make an obvious bet
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.240]   on, "I'm going to invest in the internet."
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.400]   There wasn't an option.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:12.240]   What's happening on Ethereum, the kinds of software getting built on top of it and programs,
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:19.600]   is buying Ethereum, the token, effectively a way to bet on that whole network being the
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.560]   way we do lots of things on the internet?
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:27.300]   Similar to how mobile brought about this whole world of apps and everything, and can the
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.640]   blockchain with Ethereum do that?
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:34.840]   And if so, is buying Ethereum tokens the way to bet on things in the future happening on
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.840]   the blockchain?
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.840]   I think so.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.640]   I think it's the best way I can think of.
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:45.600]   I don't know of a better way to holistically express that view than buying Ethereum.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:52.840]   Ethereum is like oil meets stock in the company that makes the network, but it's definitely
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.960]   not stock and it's also not precisely oil.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:01.800]   So it's like in between those two things, but I do think it would be the thing to buy
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:08.240]   if you want to express a view with an investment that, yes, these applications built on top
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:12.980]   of blockchain networks are going to continue to expand and gain adoption.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.800]   I think Ethereum is the way to play that.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.800]   Yep.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.840]   And I think that's something that a lot of trends people see, there's not an easy way
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.840]   to bet on them.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:24.920]   If you thought mobile was cool, yeah, you could bet on Apple, but who knew that there'd
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.080]   be all these companies that are monetizing these apps and Instagram would be huge and
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.280]   WhatsApp would be huge.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.600]   There's too many things to bet on.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:36.560]   And this is one of the first times in my kind of career/life that I've said, wow, this thing
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.440]   I think could be really powerful.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:43.800]   And there's actually a way that a regular person could invest $1 in, and you don't have
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.200]   to be a venture capitalist to invest in the company.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.960]   And I think who knows what the future holds, but the sheer fact that you can participate
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.680]   in it with any amount of money, I think is something that hasn't happened in the past
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.680]   and I'm pretty excited about.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.760]   It's really, really powerful.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:04.140]   And I would add globally, it's not just America, China, Europe, Africa, like literally this
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.080]   thing is open like the internet.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.640]   And so I think that's also really powerful and frequently underestimated because we're
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:16.600]   so used to just thinking of things in our U.S. centric view or folks in other countries
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.440]   are used to thinking about their market, but this is really a global market and so that's
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:21.440]   pretty powerful.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.440]   I think that's amazing.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.300]   Thank you so much for joining me.

[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.220]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:40.040]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.380]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building generational
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.720]   wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.260]   to save a dollar.
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:54.200]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:59.360]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.560]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022, but recently I listened to
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:09.920]   an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind, and it was so crazy
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.880]   to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their employer's retirement
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:15.880]   plan.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:19.300]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.040]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:25.700]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.560]   money and grow your wealth.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.680]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.120]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:37.800]   listen to podcasts and enjoy.
