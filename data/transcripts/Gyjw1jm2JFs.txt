[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   What are some of the things that good negotiators do all the time so that when the bell goes
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.600]   off and they have to respond, they are ready?
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.800]   And the reason I ask this is because we've been talking about negotiations in kind of
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.520]   a vacuum, like it's happening and then how does one handle it?
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.480]   But like any athlete, like any teacher, like any parent, like any kid, everybody has to
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.860]   be ready for real life circumstances and we don't always get the warning.
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.120]   We don't get the memo that it's happening in two weeks.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.760]   And sometimes the conversations around courtroom drama or the big day, you know, it implies
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.560]   that we get the warning, but more often than not, it's a phone call or a text and it comes
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.640]   in and boom, it just hits us.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.180]   And suddenly we are in negotiations and we didn't get time to prepare.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.840]   So maybe we could talk about readiness and then we could talk about, again, like maybe
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.660]   this sounds trivial to you, but for me, I'd be very curious to know whether or not you
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.680]   have any practices of stilling yourself, what those look like, what you've seen other people
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.560]   use to be able to get themselves into the moment of being able to show up their best
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.560]   self.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.800]   Well, readiness, small stakes practice for high stakes results.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.080]   Like I will occasionally find myself in the middle of a negotiation that I didn't expect.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.360]   If I've been throwing out stuff on a regular basis on my way during the day, verbal observations,
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.200]   what we refer to as labels, because the label seems like something just crossed your mind.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.800]   Is a label in the middle of a negotiation when I see you hesitate or look to the side?
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.480]   How do I get ready for that?
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.800]   You know, I'm on my way over here to this interview.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.000]   I'm both talking to my Lyft driver the whole way, getting him to talk, also being careful
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.340]   about not tapping the gas tank out completely so that I'm fatigued when I get here.
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.840]   Like I talk up to Lyft drivers on a regular basis, interactions, TSA guys in the airport,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.600]   I'll throw a label at them.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600]   Seems like a tough day.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.020]   Tough day?
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.800]   Seems like you're in a good mood.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.040]   And whether right or wrong, I'm getting in, I'm trying to stay loose.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.840]   I'm trying to keep the mental muscles limber.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.560]   And it just becomes a bit of a habit on a regular basis.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.920]   Occasionally, I'll throw something out.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   Now I'm talking about Lyft drivers, if I'm in a bad mood, I get into a Lyft a couple
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.280]   of weeks ago on my way home, Lyft driver is not helpful.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.280]   I mean, I'm coming out of the airport, I'm struggling with my bags, not lifting a finger,
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.080]   doesn't open up the rear, I got to open up the rear of the vehicle myself, I got to load
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.280]   the bags, everything, I get in and he's just seething unhappiness.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.280]   Now I know that if I say, "What do you love about what you do for a living?"
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.920]   I immediately trigger what Tony Robbins would call a state change.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.240]   And I'm annoyed at this guy.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:17.720]   And our pheromones are combative, but I'm thinking like, "I just don't need this."
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.400]   And so I go, "What do you love about driving for Lyft?"
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.760]   This guy proceeds to unload on me on all his personal struggles that I feel like a complete
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.860]   jerk for being angry with him at everything that he's going through.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.920]   And I'm just trying to get myself out of a bad mood and to keep from sending him a really
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.120]   negative vibe the whole way so that he doesn't drive 45 miles an hour in a 65 mile an hour
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.440]   lane and make it, you know, inflict me with a longer and more expensive ride because I'm
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.880]   so annoying as a customer.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.040]   But I've got a habit of small stakes practice for high stakes results.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.200]   And who do I get to practice on?
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.240]   The Lyft drivers on a regular basis, the guy behind the counter at the hotel, the TSA guy.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.520]   I'm going through TSA, the grocery store clerk, the Starbucks person.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.260]   The only way I'm at my best in my negotiations is just trying to keep my negotiation muscles
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.680]   limber by interacting with people throughout the course of my day.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.980]   And then ideally, you know, leaving them better than I found them, you know, try and try not
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.880]   to leave negative karma in my wake, trying to leave as much positive karma in my wake
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   as possible.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.400]   I love that.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.760]   And I'm very familiar with the feeling of needing to conserve my voice for podcasting
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.920]   or energy for things.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.760]   And yet I'm somebody who's, I think, genuinely curious about what people's experiences are.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.520]   So I like the question, you know, how's your day going?
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.440]   It's pretty open ended.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.680]   It's-- I suppose if somebody was really upset, that would be perhaps the worst question I
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.480]   could possibly ask from what you just described.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.160]   But-- Well, I'll put a fine point on it, too, because
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.120]   like I've manipulated them with what do you love about?
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.960]   Because there's-- you watch them change in the moment to immediately to shift into this
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.920]   concept of love, which is more than like, what do you like about driving for Lyft?
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.520]   What do you love about driving for Lyft?
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.800]   I can trigger a state change in you instantaneously, no matter what kind of mood you're in, because
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.960]   this guy was in a very bad mood.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.640]   Plus, additionally, the download from that typically is so quick.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.520]   I'm going to get a real clear picture on who you are really, really fast.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.440]   I'm talking to a CEO of a company a couple of months ago.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.600]   They're-- you know, for lack of a better term, they're delivering clean water to the world.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.440]   And I'm like, that's a cool mission.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.960]   Like I dig this.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.880]   As an entrepreneur, an entrepreneur wanting to make a dent in the universe, I dig that.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.680]   Like, I'm trying to make a difference in the world.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.520]   So I say to him, what do you love about what you do for a living?
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.240]   He immediately fires back at me, I love leading teams.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.640]   I love leading teams.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.840]   And I love giving shareholders a great return on their investment.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.960]   It's really important for me to give shareholders a great return.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.000]   And then, yeah, you know, we deliver water.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.760]   And then he said a fourth thing, and I thought, this guy could be doing toilet paper.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.200]   He doesn't care about the mission of the company at all.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.920]   He's a great CEO probably because you want a CEO to lead teams.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:29.200]   You want a CEO to deliver-- a corporate CEO to deliver a return on investment for shareholders.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.080]   But that's why he's a great corporate CEO and not a great entrepreneurial CEO.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.520]   So by him giving me that download real quick, that was blatantly honest.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.480]   Like, do I think this is a great guy?
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.200]   Do our core values line up?
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.600]   My mission is more important to me than his mission is-- or his mission is making money.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.840]   Now, I like making money, but it's not number one.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.760]   It's a strong number two.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:04.280]   But that question instead of how are you today to what do you love about, you immediately
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.440]   put them in a better place.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.040]   Plus, you get some ridiculously candid answers that tells you who they are real fast.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.340]   (upbeat music)
