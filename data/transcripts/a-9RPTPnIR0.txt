[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.360]   Well, how can God be good and sovereign over all things and also allow intense personal suffering into people's lives?
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.400]   This is a such an important question really central to some of the things that we do at Desiring God
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.560]   In fact, and it's a question that arrived in the inbox from a young man. Hello Pastor John
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.660]   My girlfriend is becoming a respiratory therapist and since beginning her training
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.960]   She has interacted with many patients who are brain dead or have no control over their bodies
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.060]   And she has serious questions about where is God in all of this personal suffering?
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.520]   How can if he is sovereign be good by allowing certain people to suffer in this way?
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.400]   What purposes do they serve in this state?
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.000]   I've spoken to her about these things trying to answer her questions
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.520]   And I will continue to do so for I only desire her to see the Lord's character in all of this
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.160]   But I also wanted to ask you for guidance in answering these questions. What scripture should I walk her through?
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.000]   What's the best approach to answering her question?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.600]   I have found it helpful
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.660]   to distinguish between what I call
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.580]   micro reasons for why people suffer and
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.600]   macro reasons for why they're suffering in the world
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.640]   because when it comes to micro reasons like
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920]   Why this particular suffering?
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.980]   Why on this particular person?
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.540]   Why at this particular time? Why this particular?
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.320]   intensity, why with these peculiar
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.680]   complications Lord
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.600]   Why in all these particular relationships? Why this particular duration?
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.080]   Etc. When we're talking about those micro reasons, we usually don't have answers
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.820]   The Bible doesn't address
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.760]   the precise
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.180]   particular
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.820]   Situation of each person and that's where a lot of people stop and they just say oh, we don't know why
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.460]   Suffering is a total mystery
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.060]   Instead of saying no, no, no, no, no, no keep reading your Bible when it comes to macro reasons
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.260]   For why there is suffering in the world. The Bible is rich
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.300]   With helpfulness, it's explicitly intending to be helpful for us at the macro
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.880]   reasons and I have time to go into them all here if
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.840]   People want to see what I mean and what they are
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.320]   Go to desiring God and just type in the search engine
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.660]   Five purposes for suffering and and you'll get a little short summary of what I mean by the macro reasons
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.160]   So what I thought I would do here is just give one perspective
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   That our friend and his girlfriend
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.800]   May not have thought about much that could perhaps
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.560]   Be a fresh insight into dealing with either brain dead people or or people
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.520]   Who are totally unable to help themselves?
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.600]   We usually look for the purposes of suffering in the effect it has on the sufferer
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.440]   So for example, Paul says three times
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.160]   I pleaded with the Lord about his thorn in the flesh that would leave me but the Lord said my grace is sufficient for you
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.360]   My power is made perfect in weakness. And so Paul concludes well, okay
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.140]   I will boast all the more gladly in my weaknesses so that the power of Christ may rest upon me
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.140]   So so Paul the sufferer
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.940]   Turns his pain into a Christ exalting experience by showing
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.800]   Christ's all-sufficiency in his weakness. That's the way we that's the way I usually think about
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.840]   Trying to come to terms with why I or somebody else might be suffering but what we don't usually look for is
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.320]   God's purpose for our weaknesses in the lives of others
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.960]   in other words could our weaknesses be intended by God our
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.280]   Suffering be intended by God to draw out of others
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.200]   something they wouldn't otherwise have experienced concerning Christ and
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.880]   we don't often take into consideration that
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.720]   There's a whole spectrum of weaknesses
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   ranging from minor personality annoyances
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.120]   Which might call for patience from a husband or a wife or or friends all the way to being?
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.400]   braindead or being utterly dependent on the goodwill of
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.840]   Others, so let's think about this for a moment. This is very very helpful for me to do this
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.200]   I saw things in pondering this question that I had never seen before in 1st Thessalonians 5 14
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.300]   Paul says we urge you brothers admonish the idle
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.160]   Encourage the faint-hearted help the weak
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.040]   Be patient with them all now think of it God in his sovereignty
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.320]   Could cause idle saints to be industrious. He could cause faint-hearted saints to be lion-hearted
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.800]   He could cause weak saints to be strong
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:19.640]   But instead he tells the leaders of the church that these people are an occasion for their patience
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.000]   At least in the short run, then he doesn't act as if they're going away
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.200]   Some people are just gonna be that their weaknesses draw out of others evidences of God's grace
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.840]   now
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.960]   consider the fact that being utterly unable to feed oneself or care for oneself or
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.240]   Even communicate is at the far end of the spectrum of disabilities
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.080]   That the church is called upon to serve
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.960]   Many churches are awakening not only to the responsibility to serve those with disabilities, but the privilege of
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.680]   Serving them and and the key text
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.680]   may be helpful with regard to those who are all the way at the end of the spectrum of
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.280]   Disability namely the brain dead
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.720]   So I'm thinking of 1st Corinthians 12 21 following which says the eye cannot say to the hand
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.240]   I have no need of you nor again the head to the feet
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.480]   I have no need of you on the contrary the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.520]   Responsible and on those parts of the body that we think less
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.920]   honorable
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.400]   we bestow the greater honor and our
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.680]   Unpresentable parts are treated with greater
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:51.880]   Modesty which are more presentable parts do not require verse 26 if one member suffers
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:58.880]   All suffer together if one member is honored all rejoice together. Now, this is amazing when you think about it
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.000]   Paul doesn't say that the weakness and the
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.760]   dishonorableness of these people is to teach them anything
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:16.440]   The way his own thorn in the flesh was meant to teach him something keep him from being conceited. He says these weak
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.040]   seemingly
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.360]   Dishonorable people whom the world would probably despise or just throw away are
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.280]   Here for you. They're here for you
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.720]   You are strong
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:36.880]   They are here for you to show honor to for you to serve for you to care for and show grace toward
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:44.820]   Service that can never be paid back in this world. Their suffering is not about their sanctification
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.820]   It's about your sanctification
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:52.080]   Like Jesus said in Luke Luke 14 14 when you give a feast
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:08:00.200]   Invite the poor the crippled the lame the blind and you will be blessed because they cannot repay you
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.160]   I mean, how little will you get paid by a brain-dead person?
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.320]   nothing
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.520]   except
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.760]   You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just Luke 14
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.000]   14 and here's a remarkable thought about those who seem unable to make any
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:26.440]   Contribution at all had never never thought about this before I offer it for your consideration. This is first Corinthians 126
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.720]   Consider your calling brothers
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.720]   Not many of you were wise according to this world standards. Not many were powerful
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:39.080]   Not many were of noble birth, but God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:45.400]   God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong God chose
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.480]   What is low and despised?
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:54.200]   In the world and then this phrase even things that are not
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.440]   What is that?
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:02.960]   To bring to nothing things that are so that no human being may boast in the presence of God. Do you think?
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.320]   This is just I'm offering this for you to seriously ponder. Do you think?
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.480]   even things that are not
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.720]   which God chose
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.400]   To shame the things that are to make the strong realize they have a need
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:26.600]   Do you think even things that are not people so low so despised that they may as well not even be?
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.720]   Might have a relevance to the brain-dead
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:35.360]   One last text about the the week for us to reflect on acts
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.480]   2035 in all things I have shown you
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:45.720]   That by working hard in this way, we must help the weak in other words our work
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.360]   needs to supply what they can't supply that's the point and
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:58.080]   Remember the words of the Lord Jesus how he said it is more blessed to give
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.760]   Than to receive in other words the existence of the weak
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.960]   For whom we are to work in ways that they can't is
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.760]   Described by Paul as an occasion for us to be more
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.680]   blessed
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:20.960]   Because it's more blessed to give to work for the weak than to merely work for ourselves
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:27.360]   So God's ways are not our ways. He he has purposes with our weaknesses even
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.880]   Those massive disabilities that leave us unable to do anything for ourselves
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:39.680]   This is not about sanctifying the helpless in this world. It's about sanctifying the strong
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.840]   That's the whole point of those texts indeed Paul goes so far as to say it's about their joy
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.480]   Not just their patience
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.920]   Because it is more blessed to give than to receive even as we lay down our lives
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.480]   for the weakest of the weak
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:02.560]   Hmm some really profound connections here in these texts to feed our personal meditation and considerations
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:09.280]   Why weak and needy people are in our lives is very powerful Pastor John. Thank you appreciate those texts. Thanks for the question

[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.920]   Jesus is parable in the first half of Luke 16
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.440]   Does Jesus celebrate?
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:52.600]   Dishonesty, it's a real head scratcher of a text and I'll put it before Pastor John next time
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.960]   I'm your host Tony Reinke and we'll see you next time on Wednesday
