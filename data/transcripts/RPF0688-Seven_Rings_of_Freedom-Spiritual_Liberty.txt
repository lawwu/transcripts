[00:04:47.380 --> 00:05:16.280]   pacific freedom. On this particular topic, I know what I'm talking about. I'm speaking from experience. I have used these decisions to build massive levels of personal freedom into my life. And I want that for you. Having personal freedom, it's awesome. It's really, really cool. And I believe it's achievable for anybody who wants to have personal freedom.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.200]  ough.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:41.960]   I'm talking about the fact that you can be a person in your inner spirit, in your soul. You can thrive in almost any situation. Not just survive, but thrive. On the other hand, if you don't have personal spiritual liberty, you can be in bondage in almost any situation, no matter how good the external circumstances may appear to be.
