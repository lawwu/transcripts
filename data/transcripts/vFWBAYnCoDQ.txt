[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   Welcome back to the podcast on this Friday.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.440]   To close out the week, as you may know, we get a lot of pretty touching emails about
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.100]   marriage.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.400]   Like the one I'm about to read today, it's from a grieving woman, an anonymous woman,
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.640]   a young woman who lives in the Philippines.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.640]   Here's what she writes.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.520]   "Dear Pastor John, I have been up until recently very happily married.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.520]   I am now widowed.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.360]   My husband died just a few weeks ago, and I am devastated.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.600]   I believe there's a reason for why I have been left behind.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.400]   I trust God on that.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.840]   I believe there's a reason why he had to go.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.520]   I can trust God on that, and I believe that we can make it without him.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.160]   Myself, our young son, and the church my husband led.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:02.080]   I find myself experiencing joy and longing, trust and nervousness, peace and homesickness
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.760]   for heaven.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.040]   Aside from missing him and wanting the life we had back, what I can't seem to wrap my
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.400]   head around are these questions.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.860]   Why did God even allow me and my husband to share a love like ours on earth if this will
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.820]   mean nothing in heaven?
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.780]   Can't I at least be guaranteed that my husband will still be my best friend in heaven?
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.440]   Will he even be excited to see me when I get there?
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.480]   In marriage, two become one.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.280]   Am I just half a person left behind?
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.280]   I know when I get to heaven and enter God's presence, none of these questions will matter,
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.280]   but they matter now, and I struggle to find wisdom and comfort as to how I must approach
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.360]   my remaining years on earth.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360]   Thank you."
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.800]   That's a beautiful question.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.800]   It really is.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.520]   Because it's just so full of faith, right?
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.560]   At the front end and then perplexity at the back end.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.920]   The loss is still painful, and the questions are still real and urgent.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:11.360]   So let me sit down, so to speak, with her for a few minutes and think out loud about
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.400]   three of her questions in the hope that maybe my reflections from the Bible and experience
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.360]   will bring some measure of Christ-honoring comfort to her.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.640]   Behind her questions is the teaching of Jesus in Mark 12, 25, "When married people rise
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.800]   from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   heaven."
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:48.040]   In other words, marriage as we know it will not exist in the age to come.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.360]   So that's behind her questions.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.080]   That very fact for this young widow is raising numerous perplexities.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:06.460]   So first she wonders, "Why did God even allow me and my husband to share a love like
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:13.040]   ours on earth if this will mean nothing in heaven?"
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:21.840]   The first thing to say in response to this question is that in this present life, every
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:31.800]   relationship of love and faithfulness and loyalty and sacrifice and care will be celebrated
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.920]   for all eternity in tribute to the grace of God and the faithfulness of his obedient child.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.320]   The well-done good and faithful servant that Jesus speaks to his faithful followers at
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:54.840]   the resurrection is a well-done in every fruitful relationship.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.640]   Well-done for that beautiful love.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   Well-done.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:07.280]   God's gracious approval of our imperfect works of faith is not a celebrative bubble
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.520]   that pops at the second coming and is forgotten for eternity.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.800]   There are eternal good effects to all good done on the earth.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:29.440]   Ephesians 6, 8, "Whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord."
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:37.720]   Good parenting that lasts five years before a child is snatched away in a car accident.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:46.120]   Good chastity during engagement before a fiancee dies of a heart attack before the wedding.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:54.200]   Good faithfulness and intense mutually self-giving romance in marriage that she describes.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.020]   These will not be meaningless in heaven.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.580]   They won't.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:06.480]   Every good and beautiful fruit of God's Spirit in your life will reverberate forever to the
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.600]   tribute of his grace and your faith.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.040]   That's the first thing to say.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:19.200]   The sweetness and intensity of the love between you and your husband will have its echo in
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   the music of heaven.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.280]   It wasn't in vain.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.720]   And the second thing to say about this question of why God gave them such sweet love is this.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:40.880]   This world, in its most exquisite pleasures, is designed by God to show something of himself.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.840]   The heavens and everything else are declaring the glory of God, the psalm says.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:55.720]   And all these pleasures are meant to awaken thankfulness now and strong anticipation of
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.600]   the age to come, when the pleasures of this age will seem as foretastes of something vastly
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600]   greater.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   They are.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.680]   The pleasures of this present age, even the most godly of them, are not the point of the
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.080]   universe, but they are pointers to the point.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:20.640]   The Bible pictures the age to come as better than this life, not just because bad things
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:27.080]   will be taken away, but because good things will be seen to be only foretastes of better
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.280]   things, a better feast of pleasure.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.400]   Jesus showed this when he said that marriage gets replaced by something better.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.640]   Paul showed it when he described the resurrection as replacing this world with something gloriously
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.640]   better.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.040]   Listen to these words from 1 Corinthians 15, 42.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.480]   So is it with the resurrection of the dead.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.300]   What is sown is perishable.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.920]   What is raised is imperishable.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.680]   What is sown in dishonor is raised in glory.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.640]   It is sown in weakness.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.920]   It is raised in power.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.600]   It is sown a natural body.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.720]   It is raised a spiritual body.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.080]   If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:28.480]   Now, we can't conceive fully what a spiritual body is.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:35.640]   But in Paul's mind, it exceeded this present body with all its pleasures.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:43.440]   But the brightness of the glory of a blue sky exceeds a decaying, rotting seed in the
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.880]   ground.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:52.720]   So I conclude that the happiest marriage in the world is but a head start on the joys
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.680]   of heaven.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.400]   It is the appetizer before the feast.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:06.200]   It is the warm-up singer who's really good before the great artist sings.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:12.960]   God saves the best wine just like Jesus at Cana till the last.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   And in a happy marriage, even the first wine was really good.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.880]   Then our young widow asks, "Can't I at least be guaranteed that my husband will still be
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.120]   my best friend in heaven?
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.280]   Will he even be excited to see me when I get there?"
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:40.200]   Now, she knows as well as I do, and she says as much at the end, that Jesus is and will
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.120]   be her best friend.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.920]   She knows that.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.560]   No longer do I call you servants.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.000]   I have called you friends.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Greater love has no one than this, than that he laid down his life for his friends.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.920]   But I think what she's feeling is that while her husband lived, he bestowed on her something
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:10.040]   that nobody else on earth could give, a unique kind of affection, a love that gave her a
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:16.140]   very precious sense of belonging that nobody else could give on this earth.
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:22.920]   And she wonders whether she will have that sweet experience in the age to come, which
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.720]   only he was able to give her.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:33.840]   And I think the answer is, we just don't know what the music of love on earth is going to
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:40.760]   be like when it is transposed into the greater melody of the love of heaven, where there's
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.120]   no sin whatsoever.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:50.120]   This is the great unknown about the immeasurable joys of heaven.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:58.240]   What will it be like when she and her husband are beyond the possibility of sin, the sin
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.280]   of self-pity, the sin of disregard?
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:10.560]   What will it be like when we are not capable of being disappointed, when we're not capable
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:17.320]   of being sad at any relationship that God has established?
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:25.120]   Your husband, I venture to say then, will be for you and you will be for him all that
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:34.600]   you need each other to be in order for your joy to be full in the presence of God.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:43.840]   And finally, she wonders this, since in marriage the two become one, am I just half a person
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.360]   left behind?
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:55.000]   The answer is no, you are not only half a person left behind.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.040]   It's not that simple.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.760]   Yes, part of you is gone.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.920]   I'll admit that.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.040]   I think you should own that.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.360]   And that's sad.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.200]   Part of you is gone.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:15.280]   Only he could draw out of you certain desires, certain kinds of laughter, kinds of anger,
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.880]   kinds of peace, countless other inner responses that you can't even put into words.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:31.200]   He had become so embedded in your life that for him to be absent is yes, for part of you
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.520]   yourself to be absent.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.040]   That's true.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.120]   Things will never be just the same again.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:45.000]   And it would dishonor him to think that they should be.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.360]   But consider this.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:55.120]   Not all that you became by union with him is lost.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.760]   You know it's not.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:04.800]   You became a wiser, deeper, better person because of life with him.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.560]   He did not take all of that with him when he left.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.820]   You know he didn't.
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.500]   You know who you are.
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:21.000]   And what you became through him is not less, but more, more than you were before he entered
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.880]   your life.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.360]   God has not made you less, but more.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.680]   Things will never be the same.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.180]   That's true.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:40.720]   But God's call on your life now is to be the person you became through love with your husband
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.640]   for the glory of God.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.640]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.620]   And thank you to the woman who sent in this very raw email.
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:53.360]   We appreciate your willingness to share your life with us all on the podcast with a question
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.480]   like this one.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.200]   We break for the weekend now, and when we return on Monday, we're going to look at whether
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.120]   or not there are any morally neutral areas of life.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:09.160]   Are there okay things in life that aren't sin, but aren't exactly holy or beneficial
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:16.080]   either?
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:26.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
