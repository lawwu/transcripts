[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, the base meaning of the word entertainment
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   is to hold.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.920]   It's a term for maintaining interest.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.840]   To entertain is to capture and to hold one's attention.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.400]   And we naturally find the passive watching of television
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.280]   more appealing than labor.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.520]   Entertainment holds us.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.480]   But the on-demand access we have for a lifetime
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.000]   of captivating entertainment literally at our fingertips
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.680]   also raises really important questions
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.680]   about what it is that most holds my attention.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.100]   And does God have any chance at competing for my attention
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.520]   with the allure of Hollywood?
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.880]   Thus, this question from a listener named Craig.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.920]   Dear Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.920]   I know that I have begged for Christ
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.680]   to receive my heart and life.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.640]   My repentance is sincere.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.300]   I've stopped my willful sinning
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.240]   and I'm doing everything I can to live a holy life.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.800]   My question is about my desire and satisfaction
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.080]   in spiritual discipline and worship.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.600]   I prefer entertainment to time with God.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.760]   That's the honest truth.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.080]   Time with God feels like labor.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.900]   Entertainment is the passive place I go
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.980]   to get away from work for a while.
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.640]   But I'm also terrified for my soul
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.520]   because my past tells me I'm just not trying hard enough
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.720]   and I will regret this in the future.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.080]   Is my preference for entertainment over communion with God
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.980]   simply a personal discipline issue?
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.200]   - Well, nothing is simple.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.040]   (laughs)
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.880]   - Yeah, right.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.760]   - Nothing is simple.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.700]   This is a really important question.
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.380]   And I'm glad to say something about it.
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.880]   Though in the end, Craig, you and I both know
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.720]   that we must experience a miracle
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.480]   to delight in God more than we delight
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.080]   in the entertainments of the world.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.520]   Nothing you do or I do, finally, decisively,
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.360]   can make it happen.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.000]   It's a gift of God.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.320]   But God has given us means,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.120]   so let's see if I can say something that might be helpful.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.980]   One of the things that I want to say
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.340]   is that I know there are people who would counsel Craig
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.100]   by simply saying, "Lighten up, good grief.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.860]   "You sound like a legalist.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.500]   "Just go ahead and relax and enjoy the entertainments
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.800]   "that feel like they're a threat to your holiness.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.740]   "You are perfect in Jesus, you know,
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.300]   "because of your justification."
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.460]   So it doesn't matter what movies you watch
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.620]   or how much time you spend with TV or video games
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.220]   or Facebook or Twitter, it doesn't matter.
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.720]   Just lighten up and enjoy your freedom in Jesus.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.580]   Now, the problem with that counsel
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.440]   is that it totally contradicts the relationship
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.500]   between justification and sanctification
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.440]   which Jesus and Paul and the writer of Hebrews
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.660]   and the other New Testament writers describe.
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.380]   For them, the glorious truth that we are accepted
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.580]   by God, justified by God, loved by God,
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.380]   by grace alone, on the basis of Christ alone,
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.460]   through faith alone,
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.460]   that reality has unleashed a power for holiness
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.940]   which we in fact experience
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.100]   through major spiritual warfare
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.900]   against the world, the flesh, and the devil.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.820]   I don't think the New Testament ever says, "Lighten up."
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.260]   It says, "Fight to the end."
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.260]   And of course, part of the fight is to be cheerful
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.460]   under the light burden and easy yoke of Jesus.
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.140]   Jesus said to cut off your hand or gouge out your eye
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.340]   rather than give way to the entertainments of lust.
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.580]   Jesus said, "Whoever doesn't love me more
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.440]   than they love their mother or father isn't worthy of me."
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.060]   Paul said, "If you don't put to death
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.420]   the deeds of the body, you won't live."
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.860]   John says, "If you love the world,
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.500]   the love of the Father is not in you."
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.900]   Hebrews says, "Pursue the holiness
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.500]   without which you won't see the Lord."
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.860]   Those modern day antinomians
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.360]   who use their own unbiblical brains
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.380]   to describe the indiscriminate lifestyle of justification
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.140]   are leading many people astray.
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.140]   So I congratulate you, Craig,
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.140]   for caring so deeply about this matter of personal holiness.
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.180]   And I hope you never solve the problem of your distress
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.300]   by embracing teachings that contradict the Bible.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.840]   It will be a very short-lived solution.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.780]   So what should we do when a focus on God and Christ
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.820]   and the Spirit and His saving work in the world feels boring?
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.620]   Or unsatisfying?
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.020]   While the excitements of TV and movies and video games
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.700]   and sports feel so attractive and so exciting,
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.660]   far more interesting than God, what should we do?
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.060]   And you are right to do the first thing,
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.940]   namely we should tremble.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.140]   And the reason we should tremble
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.300]   is because that preference for the world
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.620]   is the condition of the whole world.
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.620]   The natural man cannot receive or enjoy or be satisfied
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.580]   or find supremely interesting the things of the Spirit.
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.340]   They are foolishness to him.
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.900]   That's the mark of the natural man.
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.340]   Therefore, if we feel that way, we should tremble
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.580]   because we're acting like mere men,
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.460]   not like children of God.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.140]   Something is keeping you, Craig.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.340]   Something is keeping you,
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.340]   and a few million others like you,
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.260]   from seeing God and His ways for who He really is.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.860]   Because Paul said in 2 Corinthians 3:18
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.860]   that if we see Him for who He really is,
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.660]   if we behold His glory,
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.460]   we will be changed from one degree of glory to the next.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.460]   So something is hindering you from seeing,
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.340]   tasting the totally beautiful, totally interesting,
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.260]   totally satisfying God in Christ and all that He is for us.
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.940]   And I don't know what it is, Craig, in your case,
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.420]   but that's where the battle is fought.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.580]   The battle is fought in seeing.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.340]   We need to see.
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.900]   So here are three suggestions,
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.540]   and maybe the Lord will use one of them.
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.340]   One, ask the Lord to direct you
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.140]   to someone who's a non-believer,
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.620]   a non-believer, or a baby believer,
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.500]   or a falling away believer,
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.900]   so that you can, with all your heart,
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.340]   share with them what it is about God
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.500]   that should draw them back.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.900]   Now, that's gonna sound counterintuitive to you.
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.500]   You're gonna feel like you're in a position to do that.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.500]   But I have seen it over and over again in my own life
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.980]   and the testimony of others
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.180]   that when I am thrown into a situation
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.780]   where my own love for God is tested
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.980]   by my love for people in my desire for them to know God
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.820]   and join me in eternal life,
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.220]   barriers come down between me and God.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.700]   Barriers are torn down to my experience
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.580]   of the truth and beauty of God.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.660]   So, counterintuitive as it sounds,
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.940]   I suggest you go find somebody who's not a believer
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.940]   and tell them how worthy Jesus is of their belief
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.780]   and see what happens.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.780]   Number two, think through what kinds of downtime you need
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.100]   and what forms of downtime would be pure
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.900]   and not a contradiction of your holiness.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.540]   My guess is that without giving it a lot of thought,
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.900]   you are defaulting to worldly entertainments
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.620]   which leave you with a sense of compromise
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.740]   because the worldview with which they're so saturated
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.220]   and other aspects of immorality in them
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.980]   are defiling your conscience.
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.420]   God intends for us to have downtime.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.780]   The spring can't be always wound tight.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.540]   So, think through the kinds of downtime that would be pure
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.340]   and wouldn't be so blatantly in competition
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.140]   with your delight in God.
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.260]   Make them an expression of delight in God.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.300]   And here's the last suggestion.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.060]   It's right off my front burner.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.460]   Find somebody who's dead, some great author,
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.420]   or somebody who's living,
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:47.140]   who either speaks or writes about God
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:52.140]   as one who has really tasted and seen
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.660]   that God is glorious and beautiful and satisfying
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.740]   and who writes about it in such a way
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.820]   that when you read it, you taste it.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.420]   Now, right now, I'm reading John Owen
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.220]   on the duty of being spiritually minded.
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:16.660]   And that's what Owen is doing for me.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.060]   I use my Sundays especially for Owen.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.940]   We don't have a lot of time otherwise,
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.220]   but I've got a long period Sunday afternoon
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.220]   when nothing is scheduled usually,
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.660]   and I sit on my couch and I let Owen do work on me.
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.660]   And he is helping me with the very problem you expressed.
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:41.460]   When I read him, I awaken to the authentic reality
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.980]   of what the Bible means by spiritual mindedness.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.380]   And I realized what a dunce I am.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.940]   I mean, Owen just unpacks biblical phrases
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.340]   in a way that makes me feel like
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.220]   I've never read them.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.980]   And joy starts to rise as I taste.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.980]   Yes, yes, there it is.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.820]   I taste it.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.540]   I know what he's talking about.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.860]   That's glorious.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.500]   I feel it afresh.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.500]   So I pray, Craig, that you will not give up the fight,
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.140]   but come to the end of your life and say with Paul,
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.980]   I have fought the good fight.
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.460]   I have finished my course.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.260]   I have kept the faith.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.460]   Beautiful.
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.820]   It's a fight worth fighting in our media age.
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.700]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.900]   And Craig, thank you for the question.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.460]   And thanks for listening and making the podcast
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.940]   part of your day and your commute.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.460]   Three times a week we publish
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.260]   and you can subscribe to our audio feeds
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.780]   and search our past episodes in our archive
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.220]   and even reach us by email with a question of your own,
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.060]   especially if you have a question about entertainment.
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.060]   And I think there's a lot more to talk about here,
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.280]   even if these questions and these conversations
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.460]   are the most uncomfortable ones,
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.300]   they are very good to address.
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.900]   Send us your questions, see our archive,
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.740]   and check out what's going on with the podcast.
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.140]   You can do all of that through our online home
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.180]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.800]   Well, the absolute sovereignty of God over all things
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.180]   seems to make some believers more energetic,
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.500]   ambitious, and determined to reach the nations
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.060]   with the gospel.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.220]   But that same sovereignty also seems to make
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.100]   other believers more apathetic, withdrawn,
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.880]   and passive with the gospel.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.420]   So why is there this difference?
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.420]   That's the question on Wednesday.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.020]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:44.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
