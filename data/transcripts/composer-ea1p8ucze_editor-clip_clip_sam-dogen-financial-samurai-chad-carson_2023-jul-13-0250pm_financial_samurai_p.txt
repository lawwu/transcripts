[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast. And in this episode, I have
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.180]   with me a special guest, Chad Carson, author of The Small and Mighty Real Estate Investor.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.180]   Welcome to the show, Chad.
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.120]   It's great to be here, Sam. Thanks for having me.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.560]   Thanks for coming on. You have a great story because you played football at Clemson, a
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.920]   powerhouse school, and then you went on to do something that seems very entrepreneurial
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.560]   and you started investing in real estate. So football, college sports, real estate,
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.840]   two of my favorite things in life. Can you share with the audience how your football
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.800]   journey came to be?
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.000]   It was always a childhood dream of mine. My father played football at Georgia Tech in
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.960]   Atlanta. And so I grew up going to games with him. And it was sort of a father-son bonding
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.360]   thing with my brother as well. And I love the helmets and the idea of it and the stadium
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.160]   and the noise. And so luckily, I also had a little bit of size to actually match my
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160]   dreams of wanting to play college football. And when I got into high school, I grew up
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.560]   to be about 6'3" and eventually 230 pounds in college. So I had enough of a build to
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.060]   be a linebacker, which is what I played in college. And I was sort of on the bubble of
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.520]   getting a college scholarship at a big school. And you might find it interesting. I got pretty
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.920]   good grades and I actually got recruited by some of the Ivy Leagues to play, by Harvard,
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.960]   Princeton, that kind of thing. But it came down to money and also location. And my parents
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.920]   did pretty well. They made good income and I would not have gotten any financial aid
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.440]   at the Ivy Leagues and no scholarships. And I would have had to take on some debt and
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.000]   or get a full scholarship to play at a Division I-A school like Clemson University. And I
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   chose the scholarship.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   So you got a full scholarship?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.960]   Yeah, full scholarship and played all four years. And it ended up being the captain on
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.120]   the team my last two years. So I was very lucky in a lot of ways because some of that
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.160]   is just luck of being in the right place at the right time. But I also had a good time
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.160]   playing.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.000]   Wow. And so now as an adult with two children, how do you view that decision now? Because
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.160]   so few people get to the pros. I mean, for you as a starter, as a captain, four years
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.840]   at Clemson, did you try to become pro for the first year? How did that go?
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.800]   I tried. It was always my dream to play college football. It was just sort of an opportunistic
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.560]   dream to play NFL. It wasn't like, "Oh, I really want to do this." But I got recruited
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.760]   or the scouts were saying, "You should go try out." And I did the test and I basically
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.960]   flopped. I did really poorly my senior year. And my heart wasn't in it. I didn't want to
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.600]   keep grinding away at it. I could have played in the Canadian Football League, but I just
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.400]   decided to hang it up and just say, "Yeah, I'm done. Let me figure something else out
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.360]   with my life." Football is one of those things that's so intense and there's so many injuries
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.400]   as well that if you make it four years and you still are relatively injury-free, I think
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.240]   you should call it lucky. I got my school paid for. Let's move on.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.680]   Yeah. I mean, I've seen some pro football players, so many, they retire at 26, 27. A
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.520]   couple guys or one guy left before earning his 20 million contract if he just stayed
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.040]   one more year. Is it that brutal?
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.040]   It can be.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.240]   Or is it a mental thing? Like, what's going on?
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.240]   I mean, there are definitely the knee injuries, the shoulder injuries. I'm a little more concerned
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.400]   about the head injuries long-term. And that's something that you never know what that really
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.960]   looks like. And the science is still kind of developing on that. But I don't know. For
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.360]   me, at least, it was, there's other opportunities out there. I've played this card for a long
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.360]   time. I was interested in entrepreneurship. I actually applied to medical schools as well.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.400]   So I was like, "I want to study abroad. I want to do some other stuff that I haven't
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.360]   been able to do yet." And so for me, it was like, "There's other options. Let me go just
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   do some other stuff."
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.120]   Right, right. And if your daughters, how old are they now?
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.120]   10 and 12.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:56.360]   Okay, 10 and 12. So you've got six to eight years. What if they got Ivy League, but you
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:04.000]   have to pay full price, or they got into a school like Clemson on an athletic scholarship?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.920]   How would you guide them to which path to choose?
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.240]   I am definitely more in the value camp. I see a lot of value in good public universities.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.720]   I've had a good experience. I actually got recruited to play William & Mary as well.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.720]   I don't know if that's your alma mater.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.720]   Oh, really?
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.720]   Is that your alma mater?
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720]   Yeah, yeah. That is my alma mater.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.440]   And I think there's so many great professors. There's so many good experiences you can have
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.200]   anywhere that having a bunch of debt or having to spend a lot of money as parents on something
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.680]   that, yes, I'm sure there's some financial returns, but a big part of me, even my story
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.480]   with as a real estate investor and a small, mighty investor is working it backwards from
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.880]   the type of lifestyle you want. And I feel like going in the grind of having to pay off
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.240]   all that debt and having to get a really high paying job, as opposed to the opportunity
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.120]   I had, have no debt, I'm pretty sure I would not have become an entrepreneur at 23 years
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.240]   old if I had had a lot of debt. I probably would have gone the more traditional route
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.920]   and tried to pay it off. And maybe that would have been fine as well. There's no telling
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.280]   what would happen. But I'm pretty happy that I did that because I've really enjoyed the
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.080]   flexibility and the entrepreneurship lifestyle. And I feel like debt is such a saddle for
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.680]   a lot of people. It's something that limits your options, especially when you're 23, 24,
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.160]   25, that if you have an opportunity to not have to do that and still get a good education,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.320]   I think that's where I would, if my influence mattered, if they listened to me, that's the
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.560]   counsel I would give.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.360]   Got it. So what did you actually do right out of Clemson at 23?
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.600]   I took a break. I had this Forrest Gump moment when I was out training, thinking I was still
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   going to the NFL. It was like 98 degrees in South Carolina humidity. And I got done running
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.160]   a wind sprint and I just laid down on the field and I was like, I'm done now. It was
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.800]   just like Forrest Gump. I'm done. And I called my agent right after that and said, I know
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.800]   probably there's no teams that are going to call and try to get me to play, but if they
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.920]   do, I'm done. I'm retired. And I decided to go to Europe for a little while. I went to
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.240]   Germany for a month and just did a study abroad experience. I worked a little bit painting
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.640]   houses for my dad who had some rental properties. And then I went back and took some classes
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.280]   at Clemson. I talked the athletic department into paying for some classes. So I think I
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.960]   took entomology and Spanish and philosophy of science, just some fun stuff, just because
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.040]   I didn't know what I wanted to do. But I also took a business class and I met this professor
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.000]   in this business class who's a real estate investor. And he seemed to have this really
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.080]   flexible lifestyle and he was an entrepreneur. And he just really intrigued me what he was
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.800]   doing. And I said, you know what? I think I'm going to try that for a little while.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.160]   And I started talking to him after class and he is still to this day a mentor of mine.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.320]   He was a private lender to help me get started. He loaned me some money. He gave me a lot
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.280]   of advice, just a friend. So you never know what's going to happen when you take a class
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.520]   at a university and it goes from there.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.120]   Right. Got it. It's interesting that you had the NFL thing and then you had the moment
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.040]   and then you started on real estate. And so tell me about the book. It's a big book, 380
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.680]   plus pages. It's very thorough. It teaches everything you need to know about analyzing
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:19.680]   property. And one of the things that really struck out to me was this quote or this statement,
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.280]   "Own the minimum number of investments that accomplish your goals. Instead of 10x, you
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:31.200]   want to half x." And I thought that was really an insightful line. Can you talk about what
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   that means?
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.480]   Yeah. This is a part of my experience was I went down the 10x, let's go big path because
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.680]   I was as a new entrepreneur, you're always absorbing information from different sources.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.440]   And I went to classes and a lot of the real estate I think is more susceptible than other
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.680]   places. There's a lot of rah-rah, let's go big, you can do this, buy a lot of properties.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.240]   And I got taken up into that a little bit my first few years. And I have a business
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.200]   partner by the way. So we're 50/50 business partners and the two of us got started buying
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.480]   properties and we started flipping a lot of houses. That was our business model early
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:10.840]   on. And it seemed to be the logic was if that's working, if you can make $20,000 or $30,000
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:16.640]   per flip, why not do 10 of those or 20 of those or 30 of those? And so we as new investors
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.920]   were like, "Okay, I think we can do that." And so we just started turning the volume
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:26.040]   up. But the problem was, we actually did that, we did pretty well. But the problem was 2007,
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.840]   we had 33 properties that we bought in one year.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.840]   In 2007?
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.840]   In 2007.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.840]   That's tough, man.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:37.040]   The storm clouds are brewing. And so not only do we have a tough economy ahead of us, and
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.400]   we kind of saw that, I didn't predict it, I didn't see it coming, but you could feel
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.880]   it as it happened. But then we also had this moment, my business partner more than me,
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.200]   I think, where he's like, "What are we actually investing in real estate for? What
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.880]   are we trying to accomplish?" And the business model we're going now, you have to hire employees,
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.560]   you have to spend a bunch of money on marketing, there's a lot of overhead. And so we had
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.160]   sort of this realization that, "Wait a minute, there's an alternative path. We could just
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.800]   kind of keep this business smaller, simpler, grow a little bit slower, have less risk."
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.120]   And still, for me, I made a list of things I wanted to do. And I wanted to do things
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.880]   like hiking in the middle of the day, playing basketball for two hours, pick up basketball
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.400]   is one of my favorite things to do. I wasn't married yet, but I wanted to have a family,
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.480]   I wanted to get married, have kids, I wanted to spend time with my kids and be present.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.720]   So when I looked at all those things, money was definitely a factor, but it was more about
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.640]   time and mobility and flexibility. Those were the currencies that really mattered the most
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.680]   for the things I wanted to do. And so our idea at that point was, "How about build a
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.760]   business model, a real estate investing model that focuses on working backwards from that
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.560]   lifestyle first?" And it turns out that sometimes keeping it smaller, simpler, accomplishes
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.480]   that lower risk, it accomplishes a simplicity, it allows you to move a little bit slower,
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.280]   and yet it still can accomplish all of your goals if you want. That's the mighty part,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.400]   small and mighty. I don't think you have to compromise your ambitions. You might have
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.320]   to delay it a little bit. You might have to maybe not be quite as aggressive as other
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.880]   people who are maximizing their leverage. But in the end, the tortoise is still beating
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.480]   the hare, I find, and I think it's a good approach.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.000]   Well, tell us about the 30 properties you bought in 2007, though. What happened to that?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.720]   Because I remember that was a very, very painful time for the next five years or four years.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:24.280]   I would say 90% of the deals we did were good. We flipped a lot of houses. I remember our
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:30.440]   best flip, we made $65,000 on one flip. So that was nice. We had other properties that
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.880]   were rental properties, a couple of multifamily properties that had good cash flow. I got
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.620]   a lot of properties with seller financing and private financing. So I wasn't susceptible
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.200]   as much to the bank lending issues and the commercial loans like a lot of people were.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.600]   But then we had about 5% or 10% of our properties that because we were going so fast, because
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.800]   we were just being lazy or sloppy or whatever you want to say, we bought in the wrong locations.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.600]   We underestimated repair costs. And so there was enough of a problem there that we had
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.560]   to like screech the brakes. We had to feed those properties using a lot of the cash we
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.680]   had made for the last two or three years. So luckily, we didn't spend much money. We
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.920]   set all that money aside, most of it. And I lived very, very lean anyway. But we needed
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.600]   it. We didn't make any profits for the next couple of years. If we made some profits,
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:21.240]   we spent it fixing up properties, negative cash flow. But I would say by 2009 or end
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.880]   of 2009, we were convinced that we're okay. We're fine. We're not going to have to. And
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.920]   then we started, the good thing was on the other side of that, of course, was a ton.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.440]   There are a lot of good deals. And so any real estate investors still standing at that
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   point who still had access to money, which we did, because we had a lot of private lenders,
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.840]   we still had a couple banking relationships, we were able to scoop up some of the best
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:47.680]   deals ever for the next five, six years. Like it didn't stop in 2010. I mean, some of the
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.920]   best deals we bought were in 2015, 16, even after the recession.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:59.840]   What would you, if you have a percentage breakdown between properties that you own for cash flow
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:06.760]   and properties you own to remodel and flip? What's the target percentage breakdown now?
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.720]   And what's the portfolio breakdown now?
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.040]   0% flips now. We don't do any flips. I live in Spain right now. So we've been here for
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.040]   the last 12 months. And we really transitioned more into the buy and hold model. But for
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.000]   us, the flips were just a substitute for people like you working your investment banking job
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.080]   or your Wall Street job or somebody who's a doctor and they're working that job or somebody
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:33.640]   who's a teacher. It was just the way we paid the bills. And so starting off, it was 100%
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:40.200]   flips for the first two years. And then starting about 2004, maybe a year and a half then,
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.680]   we bought one rental property, but we did it very creatively with a smaller down payment
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:48.480]   and seller financing. So we really had to be very scrappy in order to be able to, because
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.520]   we weren't very bankable. For us as an entrepreneur to go into a bank and say, "I'd like to borrow
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:58.840]   money, 30 year fixed money." They're like, "You're basically unemployed as far as we're
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.160]   concerned. So forget that." So we had to start a little slower on the rental process, which
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.800]   was fine because we weren't ready yet. For us to go buy a bunch of rentals without cash
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:14.040]   reserves, without the backing was not a smart move anyway. So it kind of flipped from 100%
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:20.080]   flips to 90% flips to by the time we got to 2009, 10, which was about five, six years
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:27.440]   after we started, I would say we probably did 10 or 20% flips, 80, 90% rentals. And
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.160]   now it's 100% rentals.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.880]   And how big is your portfolio now?
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.920]   We have 33 properties, but then out of those properties, we have some multi-unit properties.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.800]   So it's 100 units total and I have a 50/50 partner. So I kind of look at my version of
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:47.360]   the portfolio is like 16, 17 properties and 50 units. So I'm kind of on the bigger side
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:53.560]   of small and mighty. I've also been doing this full time. So this has been my career
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.120]   and this is how we paid the bills. And the thing I've realized though is that I could
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.800]   have in 2009 when we started making those switches and this transitioning, we could
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.520]   have gone the path of trying to grow out of this. Like, all right, let's just get bigger.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.560]   Let's manage more properties. And even at the size we were, we started coasting and
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:16.760]   we'd sell some, we'd buy some, we'd sell some, we'd buy some. We haven't tried to significantly
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.320]   change our portfolio, especially the last five, six years. We've kind of kept it where
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.240]   we are and reinvested the capital into paying off debt, into doing other ways to restructure
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.560]   our capital instead of just buying more properties, buying more properties.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.240]   And given you have a partner, did you set up a LLC?
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:41.120]   Yes. Yeah. So we just had hired an attorney to help us do it and set up a simple LLC.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.680]   And we're literally like, we're both the managers, we're both the 50% owners. We didn't really
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.200]   know what we were doing, I'll be honest, when we first started. And a lot of people ask
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.720]   me about how do you, partnerships don't usually work, they usually fall out. And part of that
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.960]   was just luck. But I think the part that worked out was this was a friend of mine first and
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   we went to seminars together, to classes together. We also divided up the tasks. So when we first
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.280]   started, I was the acquisitions person. I was the person who talked to private lenders
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.160]   and banks. He was the one who managed the remodel and then got it sold or rented out.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:20.120]   And so we got literally like split the business in two. And over the years that's changed.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.400]   He's got a tech company, he's got an internet business. So over the years, he's kind of
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.280]   spent a lot of time on that, which has been good because that business has made a lot
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:32.080]   of money as well. And we've looked at it as like interchangeable parts. At some points,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.080]   I'm the person doing a lot of the work, other times he's doing the work, but it was very
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.800]   clear whose roles and responsibilities were what, how we're getting paid. And so I think
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.320]   that clear communication and then just having some similar goals that both of us wanted
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.280]   not to go and keep on growing and keep on syndicating and doing all that. We had pretty
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.760]   similar goals on what we were trying to accomplish.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:57.840]   Got it. So in terms of capital raising, what's the source of your capital now in terms of
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.280]   buying a new property?
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:05.560]   Either a private loan, which just means going to an individual who's made us loans before
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.000]   and they either have the money in the bank, just they just have cash money, or they have
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.720]   a self-directed retirement account. It's been a really common tool we've used. So maybe
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.680]   they have a million bucks in the retirement account, but they only want 500,000 in the
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.000]   stock market. They want to have some exposure to real estate as well, but they don't want
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   to do all the rental work or they don't want to own a rental in their retirement account
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.360]   for whatever reason. So they'll just make a loan to us. And originally that loan was
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.920]   a 10% interest loan when we were flipping houses. And so it's like a hard money loan
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.240]   basically. But as we grew and as we hit the recession, we went back to our private lenders
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.240]   and said, "We're going to pay all your loans off because we can't afford to pay 10% interest
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.000]   or we can just start paying you 6% interest and we'd be happy doing that. We can cash
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.320]   flow it at that interest rate." And we had two or three of them switch to that. And so
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:56.440]   we've been paying them 6% interest for years. So it's either that or we use our own cash
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.120]   these days just to pay cash for it.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.280]   Got it. It is interesting now in this higher interest rate environment, I mean, it looks
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:11.440]   like inflation definitely has rolled over 3% CPI in June, 2023. How do you see the lending
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.320]   environment now and how do you see it going forward over the next 12 to 24 months?
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.960]   The thing I've noticed is that the lending goes in cycles. And I like to study the history
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.640]   of real estate investing. And if you look at people who invested in the '70s and early
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.400]   '80s, this is nothing. This whole interest rate change is pretty similar, especially
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.600]   in the early '80s where Volcker raised interest rates a lot. And the common theme I heard
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.120]   studying that time in the market was people had to get creative with how they got their
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.040]   financing. It wasn't just, "Let's go to the bank, let's plop down 20% and let's make it
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:49.400]   work." You either had to put a lot more money down or you had to maybe get a lease option
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:55.200]   or do a partnership with somebody or get seller financing. That was much more common in the
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.680]   past, I think, because interest rates were so high. If you got an FHA loan in, I might
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.520]   get the year wrong, I think it was 1984 or so, your interest rate might have been 16%,
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.360]   18%. I can't remember the exact numbers. And if you had somebody with an existing loan
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.760]   or somebody who owned a property free and clear and they were willing to loan their
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:20.320]   finance to the property at 12%, that's a 4% spread from the market rates. And so similar
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.000]   to today, if you can find a private lender who's sitting on some money and some cash
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.440]   in the bank, and maybe they're making 4% in a CD or a treasury, but they'd like to get
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:35.440]   a little bit more and still be in a safe investment that they understand, offering them a first
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:41.280]   position mortgage on a property that's worth 500,000 and they loan you 300,000 and you
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.280]   pay them 6% interest. I mean, there are people out there who will say yes to that. That's
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:52.240]   not an unreasonable proposition. Yeah. It is interesting. So it seems like part
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:58.560]   of the activity is finding the source of capital and that keeps on going. It's not just investing.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.160]   You got to find that source of capital. Yeah. And part of that is just networking
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.120]   with other investors. Like the best private lenders I found were former real estate investors
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.680]   who just got lazy and who just didn't want to go out and do the deals themselves. And
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:15.080]   so there's a double benefit there when you're a new investor or you're new to a market by
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.080]   borrowing money from somebody who knows what they're doing. They don't want to lose their
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.280]   money and so it's very beneficial because I would show the deal to my private lender
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.960]   and they would be like, "Nope, I'm not doing that one." I'm like, "Why not? Why wouldn't
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.880]   you do that deal?" And so then I would get an education from these people who have a
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:34.060]   lot more money than I do. And I find that to be very helpful is to surround yourself
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.880]   by other people who have skin in the game and actually be willing to listen, be humble
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.620]   enough to say, "Hey, this person actually knows more than me because they've been investing
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.760]   for a long time," or they just have a concern that's legitimate, maybe I should listen to
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:51.640]   that. And so that was my original strategy. And then I sort of expanded that toolbox to
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:57.440]   also start talking to sellers. I think getting seller financing some form or fashion is a
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.080]   lot harder to negotiate. It's not something that if you go on the MLS and make an offer
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.880]   on the MLS, it's not very common that a real estate agent is going to help you negotiate
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.800]   that. And so typically you got to go directly to the seller. Typically you got to kind of
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.600]   filter out which properties you look at. I like to find properties that a landlord has
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.320]   owned for 20 or 30 years because they have a higher likelihood of having equity in the
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.460]   property because the property's gone up in value. They paid the loan down in many cases.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.320]   And so you have a lot more options when you're sitting directly with that landlord and they
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.080]   might want to exit the property management business. And so by you managing the property
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:34.760]   for them by buying it and continuing to get them a cash flow over the next five, 10, 15
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.680]   years, it's not an easy negotiation because you got to build some trust with them. But
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.240]   I found those to be some of the best deals in the end because I now have a relationship
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.560]   with that person. They now probably have another property or they're willing to loan me more
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.320]   money. And so you don't need many of those. You could just get two or three of those relationships
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.440]   and that could set you up for the rest of your deals that you have.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.260]   Yeah. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, relationships sounds like it really drives a lot of capital
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:05.040]   sourcing and a lot of deal flow. You have this great formula and it talks about the
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:11.400]   numbers in terms of seeing a hundred deals, viewing a hundred deals and then making. Can
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.480]   you talk about that count from a hundred down to that one offer?
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:21.440]   Yeah. So it's for anybody who's been in sales, buying acquisitions of real estate properties,
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.380]   real estate investments is a lot like any kind of sales funnel. So a sales funnel means
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.460]   if you were trying to sell your product, you've got to talk to maybe a hundred people who
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.520]   are potential prospects and you've got to filter them and say, all right, maybe 20 of
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.640]   those people actually meet the criteria of somebody who would be a good fit for this
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.960]   product. And then out of those 20 people, you talk to them and maybe one or two of them
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.560]   are willing to talk to you and receive an offer. Now those one or two you make an offer
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:53.280]   to maybe, you know, maybe you make four offers and maybe one of them accepts your offer.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.980]   So out of a hundred people, you get down to four. And that's, that has been my experience
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.680]   in the real estate game. Not necessarily the exact same numbers, but every time I've talked
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.800]   to a new investor who's like, ah, I can't ever find any deals. There's no deals out
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.040]   there. My answer is always like, well, how many offers have you made in the last month?
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:14.440]   And they're usually like one. So I said, you got rejected on offer on one offer you made
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.860]   one of one and you're telling me there's no deals in your market. Like come back to me
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:22.240]   when you've made 10 offers and then we'll, we'll see how it works.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.680]   I think this is really smart going, thinking about a funnel top of the funnel is wide and
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:32.440]   it goes down to find that one deal. And I've read books about creativity and how it's not
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.800]   just, Oh, you just think about it. It's like you kind of work on many, many prototypes
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.640]   before you find that one amazing thing. So it's just like the Dyson vacuum cleaner. It
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:48.000]   was like 3,500 little shifts. And so that, that, that's a really very important thing
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.340]   for investors, real estate investors to think about now in terms of just kind of managing
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.600]   the properties. Cause I, I feel like I'm a small, mighty investor because I have, I think
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.920]   I forget now like three in San Francisco, one Tahoe and then Hawaii. I can't manage
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:08.280]   more than really ideally three or four in San Francisco. And also I've, I've hit my
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.960]   limit in terms of how much property tax I want to pay because that's just ongoing and
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.920]   it bums me out twice a year when I got to pay that. How do you view, you know, property
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.040]   taxes and do you have kind of like this mental hurdle limit and how do you, do you have,
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:28.360]   I guess, property managers to manage and do you have problems managing your property manager?
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.920]   Yes, I'll tackle the property management part of things first. And for me, just the end
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.000]   result is that like living in Spain this year, for example, I've tracked it because some
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.940]   people didn't believe me when I told him before, but I typically spend on average about two
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:46.820]   hours per week managing my, my rental properties. Now, that being said, I used to spend 60 hours
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.760]   per week building this portfolio. So I don't want people to get the impression that this
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.200]   is like a real estate starts off like a, like a startup, startup company with a lot
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.880]   of work. It ends up more like, I think it can end up like a blue chip stock. Like I
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.600]   think there is that transition point. But for me, the way I was able to get it down
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:07.040]   to two hours per week were, were team and systems, team and systems. So like team is
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.440]   I have property managers and in particular, like I have different properties within my
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.720]   portfolio, but I have student rental properties and student rental properties are much more
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.480]   time intensive because the average, average time that a student stays is probably a year
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.440]   and a half on, you know, some people say a year, some people say two years, every once
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:27.040]   a while you get lucky and get a English PhD student who stays seven years, but like that's
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.360]   about, that's about the best you got. Right. So on average, you're always leasing properties.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.280]   So I used to do that myself. I learned how to do it, but it's much more time intensive.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.320]   So we hire property managers. I have two different property managers who we kind of split it
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.680]   up between them and they do a great job. They have people who are constantly working on
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:50.080]   that and I get texts from them. So I give them $500 per month or $500 per transaction
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.040]   that if they have a problem that costs $500 or less to fix, they have my authorization
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.440]   to go ahead and do it. Don't call me. I'll look at it on the, I'll look at the report
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.800]   later. I'll, I'll see it. But if it's over 500 bucks of our refrigerator costs, 900 bucks,
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.520]   then they'll text me and it's usually it's a quick response. I'd yep. Go for it. Thanks
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.760]   for asking. Thanks for getting a quote. Let's do it. And they'll go and procure their refrigerator.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:16.120]   They do it all. Yeah, they do it all. Yeah. And how much do they make? I guess they make
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:24.760]   a, in my case, a 10% a fee of the collected rent for per year. So if you have, if you
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:29.920]   have $10,000 in rent collected that month, they make a thousand dollars. And if you were
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.480]   a hundred percent vacant, they wouldn't make any money. So there's an incentive for them
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.040]   to keep the properties full. But there, but so I find it to be pretty closely aligned.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.760]   I think my interest in the property manager's interest, they, sometimes you have to push
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.960]   back a little bit on expenses. Like if they say, Oh, well let's just do that. Cause it's
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.480]   simple. And that's the contractor who we told first. I might have to some, some, sometimes
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.280]   say, Hey, let's get another quote. That seems pretty high. I think it would be good for
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.560]   a dreaded for 700 bucks. Let's, let's do that. But, but that doesn't take much time. I mean,
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.680]   I've been able to do that pretty easily. That's, that's, that's the 10 to 20 minutes per week.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.080]   And the worst case scenario, I had a septic tank that went out this year and that's, that's
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.480]   awful for everybody. Right. The tenant, first of all, has to deal with that at the house
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.080]   they're living in and septic tanks for all those who live in big cities or when you don't
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.360]   have a sewer system and you're living outside the city sewer system, you have your own sewer
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.240]   system in the backyard and they break and they have problems. I don't recommend them
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.000]   for rental properties, but we happen to have a couple that have them. And so we had to
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.320]   deal with that as a much bigger, um, much bigger bill to fix it. I think it was ended
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:31.520]   up being eight or 10,000 bucks and we had, it took a while and the tenant was upset.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.800]   So I mean, there's, there's some problems like that. But again, my property manager
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.280]   is the one who is on the front line. I'm the one communicating with them. And most of the
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.200]   time, most of my time is spent actually doing bookkeeping and just looking at the reports
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.760]   and just focusing on the numbers and what's going on. And to get to that point though,
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.560]   first I had to find, find a good property manager, have a good relationship with them,
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.040]   train them, train each other a little bit to expectations and then also building systems.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.560]   So I still, I still manage process. I still manage a few properties myself from Spain
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.880]   from where I am. But in those cases, those are my single family houses with longterm
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.240]   tenants and sometimes I'll empower them if they want, they cut the grass themselves.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.560]   For example, part of the lease, they, if there's a big problem, I'll say, Hey, if you have
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.560]   a heating and air goes out, here's the, here's my go to contractor. Just call them. Don't,
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.240]   don't worry about trying to crack me down. Just call them. I trust them. They'll go out
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:28.120]   and fix it. And so there's, you know, there's a vast difference between a student rental
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:34.120]   apartment and Airbnb managing that with a long, a longterm rental and a single family
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:38.920]   house. I find that to be a much different property management proposition. So for somebody
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:43.320]   who had, I mean, I know in your case, I'm not sure how often they turn over, but from
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:49.640]   a management standpoint, it's, um, that those would be more, more of my lower, lower management,
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:54.040]   single family house type. Is it lower management but lower returns the
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.560]   single family? Cause I'm just, I've yeah. Single family and then a condo. It's basically
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.600]   that for me. Yeah. The cashflow is always going to be lower as a percentage of the value.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.640]   That's, that's the game with single family houses is that they're like a, you know, a
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.200]   quality dividend stock that's going to get like a, you know, 1% dividend or zero dividend,
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.480]   but they're going to be tend to be the ones that grow over time. And so the game with
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.520]   single family houses has been, let's buy them. You're not gonna make much cashflow for the
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.560]   first three to five years, but the, but the rents are going to grow, the value is going
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.840]   to grow. And in some cases I might sell that property and use that as like a chess piece
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.560]   to buy another property or to pay off another property. Or in some cases, like I have some
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.240]   keeper properties that I don't ever want to sell, or at least not for a while. And because
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.800]   they're, because they're low maintenance, because they're in a great location, because
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.720]   I get seven applications every time I rent it. So you can sort of pick and choose. I
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.920]   got, I've, we basically called the herd. We've sold off some of the properties that were
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:49.680]   the least desirable, highest maintenance, highest issues with tenants. And we've kept
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.520]   the ones that were easiest. And, but, but we strategically use the ones that we didn't
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.040]   keep to sell them either to do a 1031 exchange and buy another one. Or in some cases we just
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:02.680]   bit the bullet and paid the taxes in this and use that to pay off debt on, on other
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   properties.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.880]   Is there, um, I guess it's, it's a people business. And so do you have any kind of tips
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:16.000]   or red flags in terms of finding a great property manager and also finding great tenants? Are
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   there just some common red flags that people overlook that they shouldn't?
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.160]   Uh, well, with tenants are a little simpler in that I would say you just got to have some
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.600]   written criteria and you got to stick to them. And there's so many reasons to do that. There's
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.800]   one fair housing laws say that you're supposed to have just objective financial criteria
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:40.120]   and you don't even want to try to go there of trying to be, Oh, this, I have a gut gut
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.000]   feeling. This person's a, seems like a good tenant. You just don't want to do that. You
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.560]   want to have objective criteria, but it also makes sense from a business standpoint because
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:52.280]   I, when I was a new, a new landlord, a lot of my biggest problems were when I had those
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:56.000]   kind of those edge cases where I was like, Oh, it seems like a nice person. You don't
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.600]   have to try to have a big heart, you know, man, but it seems like a good situation. But
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.800]   if you, if you would have just looked at their debt to income ratio, or if you just want
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:08.160]   to look at their credit score, it would have told you they don't qualify. Like it's just,
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.600]   just a hard line right there. And I have found, you know, maybe you miss a couple opportunities
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:18.040]   here and there where people who could have done it, but, but you also miss the 95% of
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:23.080]   the cases where they probably would have created a problem at some point. There's a reason
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.920]   there's typically a reason there. And so we've just, we've given our property managers, here's
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:33.440]   our criteria, credit score and debt to income ratio, amount of income. And we've had far
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:38.960]   that not to say we have zero problems, but we've had far fewer problems by doing that.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.600]   And so that's the tenant side property manager side. It's like, it's like hiring any team
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.800]   member team member. And I look at go back to football, the sports is some of the best
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:52.200]   football coaches. They, they see themselves in the, in the people development business.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.320]   They're in the business of, of recruiting. They recruit like when you're a college football
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.920]   coach, your number one job is recruiting. And so I see myself as a, as a owner of a
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:06.720]   business of picking not just any old property manager, I pick the best, like go to the ones
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.840]   who have some kind of quality that you identify as like, wow, they're really, they're like
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.600]   1% they're on the ball. And so in my case, I have two different kinds of property managers.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.640]   One's a bigger has a bigger operations, a lot of systems. They have hundreds of properties.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.480]   I have another property manager who is kind of a boutique property manager and they have
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.240]   zero overhead. They have no office. They're working remotely. I love that. Like, I think
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.480]   that's really scrappy. And they, they, they kind of, they're kind of like me. They like
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.120]   to just kind of work from home and do that and they make it work with technology. And
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.720]   so both of them do it in different ways. But I identified in both cases that, Hey, these,
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.240]   just watching them before I even hired them, like, all right, they're the ones who are
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.760]   kind of rising to the top of my idea, my mind, studying them, talking to them, talking to
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:52.680]   their, their clients. I was very slow to move to them. And when we did, it was a very deliberate
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.000]   decision to hire those people.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.200]   And definitely it's improved the quality of your life much more.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.440]   Oh, it's, it's night and day. Like I, this is not the first time we've lived abroad.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.520]   We lived abroad in Ecuador and my property manager, they remodeled properties for us
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.520]   while we were in Ecuador. They sent me, they handled it. They charged a fee for that, which
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:14.680]   they should by man, by doing a bigger project. But I'm telling you, it's when you get the
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.000]   right team members, it's not just like twice as good. It's like 10 times, a hundred times
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.840]   better having quality people. And sometimes you got to go through some, some tough ones
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.760]   or some make some mistakes, learning who the good person is and who they aren't. But I
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:34.520]   think, finding that person, how do you do that is by talking to referrals, talking to
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.840]   other clients, talking to other, other owners. And then just, you know, like I believe that
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:43.400]   most people have a good gut feeling on, on the character of the person. Like, I think
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.440]   if you, if you study their character, are they looking you in the eye? Are they kind
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.960]   of, are they too fast for you? Are they talking too fast? Like there's just some of those
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.720]   things that we've learned over hundreds of thousands of years of evolution or whatever,
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.920]   you know, like, you just, you just sort of know whether they're the person who's going
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.120]   to, who's shooting you straight or not.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:03.800]   Got it. I got, I got a question for you because I have this one tenant that I brought in last
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:09.400]   year. They have family, it's a good tenant, great tenant, like ideal tenant, I think.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:16.240]   But I feel like she has contacted me more than she should. And then my problem is I'm
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:23.600]   always quick to respond. And I create this, you know, this mechanism where, oh, my, my,
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:29.520]   so she asked me, for example, oh, can you bring in my garbage bins? Because we don't,
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:35.120]   we're gone for a month and a half. And I was thinking to myself, you say you have a housekeeper
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.680]   who's comes every couple weeks, why don't you just ask her? But it's like that close
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.120]   and open of a relationship. Like how, what, what would you recommend? And then she says
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.440]   like, oh, do you mind cutting the trimming the bushes or whatever? Because, you know,
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:56.480]   it doesn't look good. But in the lease, it talks about them maintaining. What kind of,
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.000]   how would you recommend I get out of this situation? Because I'm like a nice responsive
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.520]   guy, but I'm like, man, I think I have to slow my response times or something.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.200]   Yeah, I probably, I probably struggle with the same thing, Sam. Like, this is where having
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.520]   a business partner is good. Like my business partner is also a nice person, but he's a
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:17.640]   little bit more like, no, it's in the lease. Like, sorry. So, so, so maybe it's, maybe
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.240]   it's like have your, your, your silent business partner behind the scenes who says, you know
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:26.520]   what? We can't, if we did that every single time, it would just, I'd have to drive across
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:32.200]   town, like find some excuse. But like, I don't know, like I find that like, I learned a lot
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.360]   from kindergarten teachers and first grade teachers and second grade teachers and how
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.240]   they set the expectations. You know, like when a kid goes into class the first day,
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:43.560]   it's like, they seem a little bit mean almost. The kids are like, Oh man, like this teacher
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:49.680]   is serious. That mean teacher on the first day is almost always the best teacher. Then
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:55.800]   everybody loves that teacher. They're so amazing. And I find that to be very similar with landlording.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:00.720]   I've had to learn this the hard way as well. That if you, if you're, if you push the rules
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.520]   a little bit harder upfront and say, Hey, this is what, this is not the rule. This is
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.680]   what we do. And they kind of learn their lesson like the first graders, second graders do.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.280]   And then your life's a little bit easier after that.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:15.080]   Yeah. I mean, it's interesting. She says, do you mind, you know, planting some succulents?
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.240]   So actually what I did was I went above and beyond over the past month and I went to the
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:26.920]   landscape score. I, you know, I got 20 bags of mulch. I planted 70 pounds of succulents.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:31.440]   I mean, it looks good now, but I decided to do that as a teachable moment with my son
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:36.560]   to get him, get his hands dirty and do the work and to see what it entails. But the problem
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.960]   is she's going to come back from like, like a dingy yard. She didn't maintain herself
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:46.480]   to this. I think it's like a $5,000 landscape job. And then I'm like, Oh my God, what is
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.280]   she going to expect from me going forward? You know, like it's almost like she's lonely
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.080]   and it's like, she just wants to talk.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:57.040]   I know. Well, the problem with owning rentals directly is that they, you have, it's easy
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.400]   to have this temptation to, to just get involved. And I think one of the benefits I've had is
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.000]   that I am very not handy.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.320]   Like you're not, you're not there.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.160]   I'm not there. I'm in another country, first of all. And then second of all, even when
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.200]   I'm there, I'm like, Hey, I'm not good at any of that stuff. Like fixing that toilet.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.360]   I can't do it. You call the plumber. So I've just written checks. I've written checks.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.400]   Even when stuff I could learn how to do, I've just said, you know what? I just can't do
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.840]   that. I don't, I'm not, I'm not competent to do that. That's not, you know, that's technically
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.480]   what I would tell her in that case. It's like, you're welcome to do that stuff. You're welcome
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.040]   to, I'll give you permission to add landscape into the house. That'd be great, but you're
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.640]   going to need to do it. That's, that's the deal.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.200]   Yeah. Yeah. I'm too handy. Like I just look at you too. I'm like, you know what? I can
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.040]   do that. I'm going to save money and do that. And I don't have this pride of like, I mean,
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.800]   it's my property, so I might as well make it as nice as possible. And then you kind
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.520]   of go overboard. So to me, I think that is the value, a huge value of the property manager,
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:53.040]   that separation that, you know, focus on business. And this is just business, not personal, but
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.040]   that's it.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.520]   And the money makes work makes sense to people complain about the 10% management fee. But
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.120]   like if you hired somebody and if you had a business and you hired somebody to be your
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.600]   human resources person, you wouldn't look at their salary and say, Oh gosh, I got a
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.640]   big expense there. You say, no, this is an investment. Like this is an investment to
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.080]   pay a property manager because it allows you to have life. And in your case, of course,
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.840]   you've got so many other business opportunities and you can do, and I love that you letting
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.200]   your son see you do. I think that has a ton of value beyond just money. But at the same,
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.400]   beyond that, I think it's, you've got a lot of other, other opportunities. We can make
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.080]   a lot more money than landscaping and doing any, any of the maintenance stuff, any of
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.720]   the management stuff. You, you, you've definitely got other high return on investment activities.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.320]   It's amazing though, like scarcity mindset, because I have that scarcity mindset. I don't
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:40.180]   want to pay 10% for someone to do it, a job that I can do myself, especially since I'm
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.480]   in the city where I can manage the property. So that is that scarcity mentality that I've
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   had that I think a lot of people do have where they don't want to spend the money because
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.520]   we're frugal and we can do it ourselves, but the returns, the upside could be huge. And
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.880]   so I'm going to follow your lead when I finally move abroad. Cause I've been talking about
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:04.040]   going back abroad once my kids both are over five years old and then hire a property manager.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.880]   Cause I think that return on investment will be much higher. So talk to us about, you know,
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.720]   being 12 months in Granada, Spain.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.440]   Yes. Southern Spain, Granada.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:17.720]   I mean, that's unbel, that's amazing. It's great. And your kids are 10 and 12. How did
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:22.920]   you decide to do that and how did you set up a education for your girls?
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:27.360]   So the origin of the story goes all the way back to when I first met my wife, like our
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.560]   very first date, we talked about studying abroad or going abroad and living abroad.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:35.120]   It was just a common interest we had. And my wife is a Spanish teacher. And so that
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.600]   was my pick, that was my pickup line with her. It was like, Oh, we're, we're in yoga
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.720]   class. And she's like, I teach Spanish. I'm like, I like to learn. I would like to learn
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:48.080]   Spanish. That sounds good to me. So that was how I got the first date. But then we decided
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.880]   before, even before we had kids, we went abroad. We've just, it's just our hobby. We love doing
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.520]   it. We've seen a lot of value in intercultural exchanges, learning new languages. It's just
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:02.000]   amazing. It gives you so much, so much different, a different perspective on life, humility.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.560]   And so we wanted our kids to have that. And we did it when they were three and five by
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:12.160]   going to Ecuador, to Cuenca, Ecuador for 17 months. And it was just so amazing that we
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.360]   got, we came back, we have family at home and we had some reasons to come back. But
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.600]   we said the moment we came back, we're like, we got to do this again. And we thought it
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.080]   would be too late if we wait too long, you know, maybe high school starts and our kids
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:28.240]   are doing activities. So 10 and 12 were, they were actually 11 and, uh, 11 and nine when
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.440]   we started and we enrolled them in local Spanish schools and we got some help. There was a
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:37.380]   consultant who helped us find a house, set up, went and talked to the school. We've never
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:41.520]   done that before. Usually we just helicopter in and figure it out ourselves, but we hired
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:46.240]   a consultant to help us do that. And it was a great, great idea. She got us into a really
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.960]   nice local school that was as a public school and it's also very international. So there's
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:55.720]   a lot of expats living in the community here. And so, you know, half, over half the kids
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.440]   are Spanish speaking, but then you also have, uh, she has a friend from Norway and another
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.160]   friend from Ireland and another friend from Australia. And so there's a, it's a really
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.680]   fun experience, not only learning Spanish and having to take all your classes in Spanish,
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.000]   which is a learning growth experience, but also just seeing like, wow, there's just so
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.320]   many different people who think differently than you and do talk differently than you.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.800]   And, uh, I don't know where that's going to lead, but I think it's a good, a good lesson
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.200]   to have in their life.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:25.480]   Absolutely. I think it's only, I think 60%? No, I forgot what the number of percentage
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.360]   of Americans own passport is, but it's not, it's not very high. And I hope if more people
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.820]   can travel and see the world and learn another language, there'll be more harmony and peace
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:39.840]   in the world. What do you think is the ideal age to start traveling abroad with your children
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.280]   where they'll really appreciate their travels?
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.480]   I think after three, our youngest daughter was three when we went to Ecuador and she
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.320]   doesn't remember right at the beginning of the trip, but she remembers the end. So I
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.440]   think, you know, three is I think when you start getting some pretty good, some decent
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.960]   memories of things and it's from a language learning standpoint, three to five is really,
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.760]   is, has a lot of good, interesting studies about fluency and ability to speak without
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:07.260]   an accent by learning it earlier. I think that's just the brain neuro neuroplasticity
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:11.300]   and the tongue. I don't know what all the details of how that works, but my younger
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.160]   daughter, when we left Ecuador would correct me all the time. I would speak Spanish and
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:21.060]   say, yeah, and she's like, and then she would like correct my, correct my Spanish and wag
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:25.240]   her finger at me. And I love that. Like I love being corrected by my kids and talking
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.880]   about my accent. And so that, I think that that age is great. Three, four, five, but
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.880]   all, but if that's too early, elementary school is wonderful too, because it's just a great,
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.880]   you can meet so many people by being a family living abroad. We've had that connection with
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.120]   people here that maybe you wouldn't if you were just going on your own. It's often hard
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.880]   to break into communities, but when you're an expat or when you're living somewhere for
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:51.240]   a shorter period of time and for us being in a part of the school community was our
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:55.120]   first community, it was wonderful to meet other parents and to have activities that
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.720]   just made the experience so much, so much richer.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:02.600]   Yeah. And, and you say you've, you've been there for a year now. Yes. And why are you
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.800]   coming back? Well, we've asked ourself that question because we're, we're kind of, we're
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.240]   having mixed feelings. Part of it is again, family, like we have some roots in our community
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.440]   in Clemson, South Carolina. Part of it, our family lives, my parents live nearby, my brother
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:21.440]   lives nearby. And so we just, we miss that. The other part of it is we, we've always kind
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.800]   of felt torn when we live abroad. We don't feel like we a hundred percent fit in. We're
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.280]   like, all right, we're kind of like, we'd like to contribute to a community. We'd like
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.920]   to have some roots here. And so, but then when we go back, we also feel like, oh, we're
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:35.320]   the, we love to travel. We like to go places, but we, but we have, we've, we've gotten very
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.480]   involved in our community in Clemson, South Carolina, beyond just the real estate. Like
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.520]   I volunteered and we started, uh, one of the problems I saw in our community, like a lot
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:47.360]   of us places is the, we're in a small, small town, but you can't walk anywhere. Like I
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.400]   would push my kids in a stroller and almost get run over by a truck. Just go into the
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.720]   park a quarter mile away. It's like, where, where are the sidewalks? Where are the bike
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:57.760]   paths? Where are the, and so I kept asking that question and all the city planners were
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.560]   like, well, no, there's some plans here, but nobody's done anything about it. And that
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:07.120]   frustrated me as an entrepreneur. And so back in 2015, I gathered some friends, friends
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.840]   of mine, and we all started a nonprofit called friends, friends of the green Crescent trail.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.040]   We've been building a network of biking and walking trails. It's been a long process,
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:20.760]   but we raised $3 million. We've finally building the first three miles of trail this year while
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.640]   I'm in Spain. And so I think those kinds of things, just getting involved in my community
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:29.880]   and feeling connected to my place in Clemson has been my personal reason. One of the reasons
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.760]   I want to go back.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:37.400]   Got it. It's been a great journey, Chad, and it's been great talking to you. If you could
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.560]   leave us with how new people would want to get started on your path, what's, what's kind
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.440]   of like a basic step just to get started?
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:51.080]   I would say just look at where you are financially. And I would say 10% of where your head should
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.200]   be is probably looking at the vision of like, this is where I want to go. Here's my financial
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:59.760]   independence goals. I want to eventually own assets that produce 120,000 a year, 240,000
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.160]   a year, like just set a big goal. Like, don't be afraid to set that goal. But then that
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.360]   where the most of the rubber meets the road is in these practical, tactical little steps.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.040]   So if you've never bought a property before, like find it, find one technique that you
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:18.080]   like like house hacking or buying a turnkey rental or all the advice that you have on
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:22.760]   your website, Sam's great. I like just find one little technique that you can use, implement
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:27.500]   it. And that, that one, that one deal you do will be like a university education compared
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:31.520]   to even the best podcast, even the best, you know, I hope you, I hope you buy my book and
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.480]   I hope you use that as a guide. But my, my whole goal with the book is to say, here's
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.440]   a guide that fills the gap between you either thinking about getting investing or maybe
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.960]   you already being an investing and you don't know how to transition to the point where
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.600]   you live off your income. Like I want to fill that gap, but you've ultimately got to do
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:50.520]   it. So I would say just like getting that entrepreneurial muscle of actually taking
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.840]   action, real estate can feel scary because you're borrowing a lot of money. The prices
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.800]   seem to be really high, but if you have a longterm perspective, if you understand the
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:03.560]   fundamentals of what a good deal is, if you understand the fundamentals of good locations,
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:07.520]   then you can be sort of counterintuitive to what a lot, you can kind of go against the
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:12.000]   grain of a lot of the, the rah, rah, scared stuff on the news and actually just focus
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.600]   on like a tortoise light mentality. One step, one step, one step. That's my, that's my approach.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:21.400]   And I think it's, it's, it serves the, the tortoise is still beating the hare and the,
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.760]   and the investing race. I really believe that. And I think it's a, that's really what the
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:29.600]   book's about is showing you a way to invest in real estate. That's not necessarily scaling
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.080]   and buying thousands of units. It's just, if you want to buy five properties or two
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:37.560]   properties and just make the most out of those two to five properties, like that's a completely
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   viable strategy. And that's, that's something I want to support you in and show you how
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:48.020]   to do that. Yeah. Well, it's a great book. Can you let the listeners know about the deal
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:52.080]   you mentioned to me and where we can find your book? Yeah. So the, the, for the first
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:56.040]   month is available. So if you're listening to this in July after July 20th, it's available
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:01.720]   at bigger pockets.com forward slash small and mighty writing out the and so I'm sure
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:06.680]   we'll have a link to that somewhere. Perfect. And so if you use the code samurai, you can
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.960]   get 10% off. So that's, that's if you, yeah, there's, there's a lot of bonuses that go
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:15.000]   with the book when you get on bigger pockets. Like I have a, a bonus chapter I wrote called
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.640]   the small and mighty invest small and mighty investing in the, in a high market or at a
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:24.080]   high price market. So 2023, how do you adjust? How do you do that? I guess my bonuses, like
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:28.000]   I show my schedule, like what I'm actually doing every week for two hours and how I got
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.160]   to the point where I spent two hours on the, on, on, on my rental properties. So all of
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.120]   that you can get at the bigger pockets website, but then eventually back in August, it'll
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:41.120]   also be available on Amazon, on audible, all the normal places as well. Got it. That's
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.600]   awesome. You're living the life that I think I definitely would like to live once my kids
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:49.880]   are older. And I think many other folks and listeners would like to live it as well. So
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:55.680]   thanks so much coach Chad Carson and we'll see you around. It's been a pleasure, Sam.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.360]   Thanks for having me. All right, take care. Take care.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:46:59.360]   Okay.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:04.360]   [inaudible]
