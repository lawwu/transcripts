[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.160]   Alright, Pastor John, here's a question about emotions and affections.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.760]   Are affections more than emotions? Are emotions part of affections?
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.520]   Are affections totally different than emotions, or are affections the source of
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.920]   emotions? How would you explain all this?
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.640]   Asking that question makes it sound like the question is, "What's the difference
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.480]   between the liver and the kidneys?" Now, what I mean is, there are two objects
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.840]   out there. One is the liver, one is the kidneys.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.920]   Everybody knows the liver if they see it. Everybody knows the kidney if they see it.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.680]   And what the question means is, "Tell me the difference between them."
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.920]   Different function, whatever. That is not what's going on in this question.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.280]   There aren't two... There isn't a liver out there called affections and a kidney
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.560]   out there called emotions. And let's just talk about the differences.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.720]   This questioner doesn't know what they are. The question really is, "What should I
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.040]   mean? What should I refer to when I use the word emotion? What should I refer to
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.600]   when I use the word affections?" At least that's the way I'm hearing it,
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.680]   because I don't know what they have in mind when they say emotion and what they
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.920]   have in mind when they say affections. So I think the best way for me to answer it
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.040]   is to say, "How do I," and say, "Jonathan Edwards, use the terms?"
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.000]   And then they can decide if they want to use them that way, because that's what
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.640]   words are. Words are meant to be assigned to realities, and we assign them
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.880]   sometimes arbitrarily, and sometimes the community assigns them for us.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.440]   But in this case, I think there isn't any clear community that is in English
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.360]   agreement on precisely what the affections and the emotions refer to.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.800]   So according to Edwards, the human soul has two faculties, reason and will.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.160]   Not a third one, like feelings or emotions. Reason and will. What those two
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:15.200]   faculties do is they perceive and think, that's the first one, and they incline.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.640]   They want or don't want. They lean in or lean away. And if you asked them,
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.280]   "Well, where are the affections in this?" as Edward uses the term, and his
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.080]   answer is, "The affections are the lively inclinings of the will."
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.840]   In other words, if the will, like a magnet, really snaps to something,
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.160]   those are affections. Or if it really recoils from something with hatred,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.320]   those are the affections. So affections are not a third faculty of the human
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:56.240]   soul. They are the lively actings of the second faculty of the will.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:04.640]   And he distinguishes it from what he calls bodily motions or animal spirits,
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:13.200]   like trembling, sweating, twitching, fainting, fluttering of the eyelids,
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.040]   short breath, you know, that sort of thing. He says those are not
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:25.600]   affections. Those are bodily reactions to affections, but they have no
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   spiritual nature to them at all. Now once you have set it up this way,
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.000]   Edwards almost never uses the word emotion. I did a word search
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.520]   looking for it. I could only find one, and that one was used almost synonymously
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.480]   with the bodily motions. E-motion, the stirring, the shaking of the body.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.120]   So the word emotion was not there for Edwards, which means I suspect that in
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.040]   our common modern language, there would be a large overlap between what
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.200]   he meant by affections and what we mean by emotions. Gratitude, love,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:20.240]   hatred, desire, and so on. But here's the key question.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.800]   Are there natural affections, and are there spiritual affections?
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.200]   Edwards would say everybody has affections, but they're of no spiritual
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.080]   worth unless they are spiritual affections, and spiritual affections
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.480]   are the kind of inclinations toward God and his word and his ways and his
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.840]   works when we've been born again to love God, delight in God, and praise God.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.040]   So the affections of the world are strong, but they're not spiritual. They're
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.800]   not born of the Holy Spirit. They're not awakened by the new birth, and they're
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   not affections for God as God, for God as beautiful and holy and satisfying.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.640]   And so Edwards and I would say those are the affections we're after,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.320]   and I love to quote Edwards. This is one of my favorite quotes as a preacher.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.640]   He says, "I think myself in the way of my duty
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:28.160]   to raise the affections of my hearers as high as I possibly can, provided they are
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.640]   affected with nothing but truth and with the affections that are not
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.400]   disagreeable to the nature of what they're affected with."
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.360]   So I conclude, Tony, by saying, yes, let's pursue those affections
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.160]   with all our might, because God is most glorified in us when we're most
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.240]   affected or satisfied in him. And desiring God exists online to
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.360]   spread that grand truth. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this
