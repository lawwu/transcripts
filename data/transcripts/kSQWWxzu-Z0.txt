[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   The only people that think a broker matters is the broker.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.480]   Your clients never care who your broker is.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.840]   It's 100% the agent.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.240]   - So if you're trying to find someone and they're like,
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.040]   "Oh, you can work with my colleague on this."
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.760]   That's like red flag.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.720]   - It used to be really useful.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.080]   Just a little history lesson.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.200]   Because there was a time where if you wanted to buy a house
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.400]   that Remax was listing,
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.320]   you had to go to a Remax agent at that office
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.560]   to buy that house.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.080]   So Remax had their listings.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.240]   Coldwell Banker had theirs.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.840]   Century 21 had theirs.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.120]   And you would jump from broker to broker
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.640]   and look at their inventory.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.560]   When we created the multiple listing service,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.160]   this was an agreement between all brokerages
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.480]   that they would all put their listings
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.160]   into one central location that everybody could see,
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.840]   which eventually morphed into the online listing portals
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.680]   that we all see when we're looking for homes.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.760]   That eliminated the value of going to an individual broker
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.560]   'cause now you can see everybody's inventory
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.840]   in the same place.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.600]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.280]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.120]   Today, we have an amazing episode
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.040]   about how to optimize the entire home buying experience.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.680]   And I mean all of it, agents, listings, diligence,
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.320]   inspections, financing, offers, and everything in between.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.280]   And while I've gone through this process twice,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.440]   I wanted to make sure we had it all covered,
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.320]   including what you might wanna do differently
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.560]   in today's market.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.000]   So I reached out to David Green and Rob Abasolo
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.560]   who hosts the number one real estate podcast out there,
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.240]   Bigger Pockets Real Estate.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.680]   They're 10 times more knowledgeable
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.200]   than I am in this space,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.240]   and I am excited to have them here.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.280]   Between the three of us, we should leave no hack unturned,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.560]   but please, if you find anything you think we missed,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.680]   put it in the comments so I can share it in a future episode.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.200]   And before diving in, if you could give us a thumbs up,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.960]   it definitely help the YouTube algorithm.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.520]   And if you're new here, please consider subscribing.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.040]   Okay, let's jump in.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.000]   How the turntables have turned.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.960]   Chris, welcome to our show,
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.320]   and I will just go ahead and welcome myself to your show
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.560]   to save you the time there.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.040]   We've got a cool little crossover event going on here today.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.120]   For those who are unfamiliar, my name is David Green.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.840]   I'm a former police officer
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.120]   who became a real estate investor
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.600]   and is now a real estate broker.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   I have a mortgage company called The One Brokerage.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.060]   I run a real estate team.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.400]   I buy rentals, I write books,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.080]   and I host the Bigger Pockets podcast.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.920]   - And I'm Rob Abasolo.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.160]   I am the co-host of the Bigger Pockets podcast.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.240]   I have a goofy YouTube channel called Rob Built
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.160]   where I teach people how to invest in real estate,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.540]   short-term rentals, tiny homes.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.960]   And I'm a former ad man, if you will,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.360]   just like the Mad Men, the TV show is basically me.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.960]   I was a copywriter and I quit all that,
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.760]   quit all the corporate dreams about two years ago
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.760]   to focus full-time on real estate
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.520]   and documenting the journey.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.640]   - I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.000]   Thanks for having me and thanks for joining me.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.720]   I host the All The Hacks podcast.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.160]   As people listening from that side know,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.560]   I'm all about trying to optimize
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.240]   and upgrade every aspect of your life.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.440]   I wanna do it while spending less and saving more
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.880]   and I wanna really dial things in.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.240]   And so I'm glad we're here
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.200]   because I've gotten lots of questions
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.440]   about just the whole home buying process.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.120]   And I was like, who could I find
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.940]   that knows more about this than I do?
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.600]   And so I thought, let's do this conversation.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.960]   You guys are the pros.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.680]   I've listened to your show, I don't know, countless times.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.020]   And I thought this could be really fun
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.180]   for everyone on both sides to go through front to back,
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.400]   how do you buy a home and optimize every step of the way?
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.760]   And for all those listening on BiggerPockets
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.520]   but who haven't heard about Chris,
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.360]   his podcast, All The Hacks is an award-winning podcast
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.320]   that will teach you to upgrade your life, money and travel
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.760]   all while spending less and saving more, which we love
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.160]   because the more money that we save,
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.780]   the more real estate we can buy,
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.580]   which is what most of us are addicted to.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.680]   So let's jump in.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.760]   Someone wants to buy a house.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.440]   I always tend to ask people,
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.200]   before you're even thinking about this,
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   why are you doing this?
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.120]   So I'm curious if you guys have any frameworks you use
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.240]   for thinking about why you would buy a house,
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.800]   what's important to you.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.120]   It doesn't even make sense
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.300]   before we jump into optimizing the entire process.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.440]   - Well, I mean, there's a lot of reasons
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.680]   to get into real estate.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.280]   I don't think that there's any one particular reason.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.560]   Some people get into real estate accidentally
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.160]   where they buy a house and they live in that house.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.540]   And then one day they decide to buy another house
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.520]   and move into that house.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.280]   And then they have to decide should they sell
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.960]   or should they buy or should they sell or keep the home?
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.800]   And then they become a landlord and then decide,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.360]   oh, hey, the cashflow from this is great.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.760]   And then they buy more houses.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.000]   Some people buy a house and then house hack
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.720]   and rent out rooms in their home
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.440]   to subsidize their mortgage.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.160]   And then there are also the other side of it
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.460]   where people work nine to five jobs
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.120]   and maybe they're not making enough money
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.120]   at that nine to five job
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.280]   and they want to create supplemental income.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.340]   So they get into real estate
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.920]   to help create monthly cashflow.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.080]   Or maybe they just want to eventually replace
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.080]   their nine to five income with real estate.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.380]   So for me, that was really why I got into it.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.660]   I had a pretty stable career in advertising,
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.920]   never really felt like I was making enough money.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.600]   And so my side hustle became real estate.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.800]   And I just started buying more properties
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.180]   as a way to make more money,
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.820]   to supplement what I didn't feel like I was making
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.660]   at my career.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.480]   What about you, David?
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.320]   What do you think?
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.460]   - There's a lot of practical reasons
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.980]   why you want to invest in real estate.
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.620]   Even the casual observer sees home prices
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.400]   getting higher and higher and higher.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.380]   You watch the HGTV shows
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.460]   that show how people can make money in real estate.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.380]   It's kind of understood that it works,
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.500]   but not everyone knows the brass tacks
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.300]   of why you can make money with real estate.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.860]   A lot of it are tax advantages.
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.820]   The tax code has quite,
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.820]   it's very forgiving for real estate investors.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.540]   And the money that you make from real estate,
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.420]   you usually pay much less taxes on
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.860]   than if you made that same money at a job,
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.900]   because there's a little bit of risk
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.300]   that's going to be involved in it.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.700]   It's easy to leverage,
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.640]   meaning I can buy a $500,000 house
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.040]   and put maybe 5% down on the loan.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.900]   So I've only put $25,000 of my money.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.380]   But when that $500,000 house appreciates by 10%,
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.060]   goes up to 550,
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.980]   my $25,000 just made me $50,000 of equity.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.200]   So it's like I've doubled my money relatively quickly,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.540]   where it's harder to invest in other assets
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.340]   where you can borrow money quite as easily.
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.300]   And then there's lots of ways
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.340]   that real estate makes you money.
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.220]   You can buy it for less than market value.
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.540]   You can't really do that with a stock.
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.700]   You can't go get a deal on Tesla stock or Apple stock
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.500]   and find some way to get it cheaper.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.340]   You can add value to the property.
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.240]   You can make it bigger.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.220]   You can make it nicer.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.060]   You can fix it out.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.220]   You can change its use so that it can be rented to people.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.020]   That creates actual equity,
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.260]   which you can't do with a stock.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.100]   There's nothing I can do if I buy Tesla stock
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.740]   to make that company worth more.
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.040]   And then like Rob mentioned,
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.420]   it actually generates revenue.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.660]   You can rent out spaces in that home.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.140]   And when you do that correctly,
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.620]   you earn more money every month
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.220]   than what it costs to own the real estate.
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.420]   And that difference is what we refer to as cashflow,
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.280]   and that can replace active income.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.180]   For anyone listening from all the hacks
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.100]   that hasn't really got into real estate investing,
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.220]   you guys have done a great job.
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.180]   I'm gonna throw out an episode
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.980]   that is about getting started with just $10,000.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.780]   I think it was episode 730,
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.420]   'cause I tried to take some notes ahead of time,
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.120]   but that was excellent.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.460]   I will say the purpose,
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.140]   or maybe the goal of this conversation
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.340]   is to kind of walk through the home buying process,
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.760]   whether you're trying to invest,
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.700]   whether you're just trying to buy your primary residence,
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.420]   whether you're buying even a vacation home or something.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.900]   So if you're listening and you're thinking,
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.000]   "I don't know if I'm ready for real estate investing."
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.540]   One, maybe you should be.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.360]   And two, this is gonna be applicable to anyone,
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.700]   no matter what type of home you're buying,
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.420]   hopefully is what we can get to.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.300]   So I know that's a little bit of the why.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.860]   For me, I've never actually dabbled too hard
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.860]   in real estate investing outside of index fund REITs,
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.620]   but I've gone through the home buying process
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.100]   as a primary residence,
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.740]   and I actually own a fractional vacation home.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.020]   So I own 1/8 of a home through a program called Picasso,
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.660]   where we bought 1/8 of a home up in Napa.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.360]   And it's interesting 'cause you can invest.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.020]   It's a lot better, in my opinion,
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.000]   than a timeshare or anything like that.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.840]   So that's been great.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.120]   So that's my experience.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.920]   And I've optimized little pieces of it along the way,
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.500]   but nothing like what you guys have.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.800]   So I'm excited.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.960]   - Curious, Chris, how well have you done?
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.740]   I think you said you bought a primary residence
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:00.800]   that you live in, right?
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.360]   - Yep, I've done that twice now.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.520]   - And how has that investment,
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.720]   if you just looked at it from a pure investment perspective,
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.440]   outperformed some of the other things you've invested in?
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.180]   - Yeah, I mean, I would say the first time around, yes,
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.100]   but I had the fortunate luck of buying in the Bay Area
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.060]   at the worst possible,
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.980]   bottom of the worst real estate crash.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.180]   So I got quite lucky by timing.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.380]   I didn't know it was gonna do as well as it did.
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.060]   The most recent one, I don't think it's been long enough
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.540]   to see anything major differences yet.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.660]   But the first one, if you layer in taxes and leverage,
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.300]   yeah, it was a great investment.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.720]   - It's hard with an N of one in a small market
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.680]   that blew up like crazy to feel like I know too much
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.680]   based on one success story.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.000]   - That's how it works, though, honestly.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.400]   It really does work like that sometimes for people
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.320]   where for me, I think every real estate...
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.520]   I was gonna say real estate.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.760]   Every real estate investor,
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.240]   they all have this big lofty dream of becoming a millionaire.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.920]   And it's super achievable because you can buy
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.880]   five properties that appreciate
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.880]   over the course of five, 10 years,
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.760]   and you could just have a million dollars in equity.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.240]   And it wasn't necessarily because you were a genius
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.360]   or because you had the most,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.200]   I don't know, I already said it,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   genius strategy, right?
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.880]   But it happens because you just did it
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.640]   and you kept doing it and you keep doing it consistently.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.800]   That's really the secret sauce.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   So yeah, maybe it was by luck
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.000]   that you bought that house and the property in that market.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.680]   But what a lot of people end up doing is
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.440]   when that happens, they get a taste for it
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.840]   and they keep just buying and buying and buying and buying.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.800]   And I think if you do that consistently,
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.840]   no matter what, you'll always look like a genius
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.160]   30 years from now.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.200]   - Yeah, we could have a much longer debate
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.360]   maybe in a future date about debating that strategy,
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.640]   putting it in a stock, all these other investments.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.120]   But I think whether you wanna build a portfolio of 20 homes,
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.580]   whether you wanna buy multi-family homes,
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.420]   commercial properties,
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.720]   or you just wanna buy a primary residence,
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.960]   at the end of the day, you gotta find a home,
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.800]   you gotta buy the home,
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.160]   you gotta decide if it's a good deal,
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.080]   you gotta close on it,
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.360]   you gotta fund the purchase
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.480]   unless you wanna buy it with cash,
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.280]   which I'm guessing most people don't.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.680]   So maybe let's jump into that process
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.600]   and kick off with just someone who's like,
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.800]   "I'm not really sure what I'm doing."
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   You've been an agent.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.800]   Let's talk a little bit about that process
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.080]   of partnering with someone
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.800]   to help you go through this process
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.780]   instead of just trying to wing it on your own.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.340]   And when that makes sense or maybe when it doesn't.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.040]   - Yeah, and if you're gonna buy a property,
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:28.880]   you don't know much about it,
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.640]   you definitely wanna use a real estate agent
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.640]   in the beginning.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.040]   And when you're buying, here's something
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.280]   people don't realize,
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.440]   you don't have to pay your agent.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.520]   If you're buying a house off of the MLS,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.760]   this would be any property you see off Zillow or Redfin,
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.920]   something like that,
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.080]   the seller has already predetermined
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.360]   a certain amount of money.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.480]   They are going to pay the buyer's agent
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.240]   for bringing you to the property.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.920]   So you have a lot of questions,
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.680]   there's paperwork you're not going to understand,
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.120]   you don't know what the process is, it's intimidating.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.080]   You find a real estate agent,
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.440]   and I'll add, they're not all the same.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.840]   There's good agents and bad agents,
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.440]   there's good lawyers and bad lawyers,
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.480]   good doctors and bad ones.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.960]   You really wanna find somebody who's good at what they do.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.240]   They can take a lot of the fear that you have
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.080]   right out of it.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.800]   I mean, it's amazing when you take this scary process
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.040]   and there's a person that, like me,
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.200]   that does this so often, it's boring to me.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.440]   Like, "Oh, another one of these,
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.400]   "I've walked this path so many times."
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.000]   It's definitely not scary.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.480]   So that's something that every person
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.480]   who wants to buy a home should know right off the bat.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.680]   Find a buyer's agent,
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.160]   they're gonna answer a lot of the questions
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.000]   that you're gonna have,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.840]   and they're going to protect you
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.360]   in ways you didn't even know
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.800]   that you needed to be protected.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.720]   And maybe we can go through
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.800]   what the actual escrow process looks like,
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.680]   or the process from start to finish
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.920]   of what to expect when buying a home if you'd like.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.720]   If you're a little bit more experienced,
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.320]   you bought homes before,
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.600]   one thing that people will look at,
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.520]   especially in a competitive market like ours, Chris,
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.920]   we just realized that we're neighbors,
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.000]   we live pretty close to each other,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.560]   probably like an hour and some change away,
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.080]   is you can go directly to the listing agent
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.200]   and you can say, "Hey, I will let you represent me
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.400]   "on this deal, but I'm gonna need
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.360]   "some kind of an advantage.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.160]   "I need you to get my offer accepted over the other people,
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.280]   "or I'd like a little bit of a discount on the price
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.320]   "if you're getting to represent me here."
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.280]   So there are people who buy a lot of real estate
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.640]   that has said, "Hey, I don't think I need
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.440]   "my own buyer's agent necessarily.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.280]   "I still need someone to handle the paperwork."
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.080]   But they go right to the listing agent,
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.000]   they look for an advantage.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.440]   And that is pretty popular in the Bay Area
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.680]   where most listings are getting several offers
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.000]   on all of them.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.360]   - Yeah, actually, I have bought two homes in the Bay Area
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.920]   and both times I've used the seller's agent.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.360]   So we can talk about that a little bit more
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.620]   'cause I have some thoughts about it,
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.720]   but maybe rewind a little.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.920]   You said it's important not all agents are the same,
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.320]   you gotta pick the right one.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   Obviously, not everyone lives in the Bay Area,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.040]   so you're not gonna be the perfect agent for everyone.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.080]   How does someone find that perfect agent?
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.160]   - First thing to look for,
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.160]   find a person that sells a lot of houses.
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.160]   Lot of agents don't.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.360]   In fact, most agents don't.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.880]   I'd say 90% of agents sell a couple houses a year or less.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.160]   And it's unpopular to say this,
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.480]   the agents get angry 'cause they're offended right now.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.280]   Like, "Just because I only sell two houses a year
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.320]   "doesn't mean I'm not good."
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.520]   Okay, I know.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.200]   However, tell me anything that you do twice a year
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.240]   that you get really, really good at.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.080]   Like, in general, that's how life works.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.320]   If you snowboard twice a year for your whole life,
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.960]   you never really get that good at snowboarding.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.480]   Or it takes you 20 years before you're as good as somebody
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.280]   that just snowboarded every weekend
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.800]   for the whole first year that they got into it.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.320]   Repetition really does develop mastery.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.700]   I talk about that in the Burr book that I wrote.
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.200]   So the first thing I look for is an agent
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.860]   that sells a lot of homes, period.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.200]   The next thing I want is an agent
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   that owns real estate themselves.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.040]   At minimum, they gotta own their own house,
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.720]   but ideally, I want them to own investment property.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.080]   It gives a completely different perspective
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.560]   when you've bought a home and you believe in it
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.120]   and you just get a different set of goggles
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.480]   to look at real estate through.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.520]   I don't have any kids.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.360]   I love kids.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.840]   We were talking about that before the show.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.080]   But each of you, as a dad, I am sure,
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.680]   sees something different when you look at a kid than I do.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.300]   Like, I don't immediately freak out
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.320]   when they start putting something in their nose.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.520]   I haven't had enough experience
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.200]   of seeing how that could go wrong.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.040]   Rob has seen some of that.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   So he's gonna have a much different emotional response
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.920]   to that marble or that Play-Doh
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.000]   getting a little bit close to the nostrils.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.880]   Real estate agents that own real estate have that sixth sense.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.740]   They can recognize that's a bad neighborhood,
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.100]   that's not the right tenant,
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.440]   that's not the right floor plan,
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.480]   that's not the right structure.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.460]   You really wanna go to this house
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.600]   that may not look as pretty in the pictures,
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.600]   but will be a better deal.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.680]   The third thing that you wanna look for
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.280]   is an agent that understands
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.160]   the financial component of real estate.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.320]   Many real estate agents are geared to cater
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.640]   to their clients' emotions.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.640]   They wanna be liked.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.700]   They're very high as an eye on the disc profile.
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.560]   This is how they make their money, by being likable.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.080]   Most people reach out to the agent
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.020]   who's the nicest, the friendliest, the warmest.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.720]   That doesn't mean they're the smartest.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.020]   So when you're having conversations,
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.320]   I always wanna hear agents that are approaching real estate
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.740]   from a financial perspective.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.200]   I wanna hear them telling me,
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   this is the part of town that's being redeveloped.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.360]   This is the next up-and-coming area.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.640]   This is where all the money is going into.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.840]   This is a property that would function as a rental
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.120]   if you moved out.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.000]   Even if that's not necessarily what you're looking for,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.360]   you just wanna buy a home.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.320]   If your agent sees things that way,
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.240]   it is very good to hedge your bets in the future
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.800]   'cause you never know when you have more kids,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.320]   need more bedrooms, get a new job,
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.800]   wanna move for some reason.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.480]   You don't wanna be locked into a situation
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.680]   where it's hard to sell that home
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.280]   or it can't be used as a rental property
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.280]   if you wanna leave it.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.600]   - David, let me ask you something.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.360]   Does the requirement of having an agent
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.960]   that owns real estate, is that as important
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.920]   if you're just buying a primary residence?
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.320]   Do you weight that a lot heavier
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.200]   for people that are looking to buy investment properties?
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.000]   - No, it's the same for a primary residence.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.840]   Let me tell you why.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.560]   The first house I ever bought,
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.000]   my agent did not own any real estate.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.480]   And I bought this house in the very end of 2009,
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.080]   great time to buy real estate, like you were saying, Chris.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.320]   My agent did not tell me that the property taxes
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.960]   in that area had special assessments assigned to them
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.280]   and were much higher than the normal property taxes.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.620]   In fact, they ended up being about $250 a month higher.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.340]   So I was expecting 300, they were 550.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.920]   Now I was buying this as a rental property,
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.680]   but even if I had bought buying it to live in,
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.800]   and I gotta remember at the time,
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.840]   the total mortgage was like $1,300.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.040]   So bumping it from 1300 to 1550
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.520]   was a pretty significant chunk.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.900]   It's like a 20% increase almost in my overall payment
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.640]   because they overlooked that property taxes were higher.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.320]   Now, agents who own real estate themselves
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.160]   would be familiar with the fact
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.760]   that property tax bills come.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.680]   There's more expenses than just your principal
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.180]   and interest on your mortgage.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.440]   They would see angles like insurance can increase
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.080]   in this area because it's in a flood zone.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.580]   I really think she missed it
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.080]   because she had never paid a mortgage on her own.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.280]   She never had her taxes and her insurance
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.400]   escrowed into her mortgage payment.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.820]   The next time I bought a house,
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.760]   it was with an agent that had been selling houses
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.480]   for a very long time and sold a lot
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.240]   and owned a lot of real estate herself.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.880]   And as we went through the process,
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.480]   she educated me.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.200]   You don't wanna buy on that part of town
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.540]   because you're gonna pay extra money
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.840]   to get the better school districts.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.180]   You don't wanna buy over there 'cause the taxes are higher.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.440]   You don't wanna buy a house like that
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.600]   because with that kind of a roof,
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.480]   your insurance is gonna be a lot higher.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.200]   I learned so much about investing in real estate
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.520]   just from the person that was getting paid to help me.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.260]   It was like free advice and free knowledge.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.900]   And it really gave me a different perspective
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.000]   of what to look for and what to avoid.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.840]   - I love it.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.400]   Okay, so I just sent a link to you
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   and there's this guy in Northern California.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.200]   Maybe you know him, Stanley Lowe.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.240]   Number one agent in Northern California for 10 years.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.000]   Looks like and is commonly described in San Mateo County
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.300]   as like the Asian Elvis of real estate agents.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.520]   And so when you first said,
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.160]   look for someone who sells a lot of houses,
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.760]   I was looking at, I know this guy.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.560]   I get the flyers in the mail.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.500]   Like he sells all the houses.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.880]   High volume, high throughput, not just low income property,
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.320]   all kinds of price ranges.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.080]   Does that mean that if I were looking for a real estate agent
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.880]   like would he be the right guy?
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.840]   Should I consider him even though it might not feel
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.320]   like someone's personality.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.600]   Maybe that's not the personality I would want
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.720]   as my real estate agent.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.360]   But like, do the numbers speak more than a personality?
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.200]   How do you think about that?
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.720]   And if anyone's curious, greenbanker.com
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.880]   is this real estate agent's website.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.400]   - I mean-- - Green without the E.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.260]   - He's got it down.
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.100]   I will say that.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.400]   I mean, the marketing, the cowhide blazer
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.280]   and the big circular glasses.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.360]   I mean, I'm in personally.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.200]   - That's funny.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.600]   That's 'cause I'd be running the other way
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.680]   the minute I saw this.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.040]   - I'm in.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.920]   - So he does sell a lot of homes, I'm sure.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.900]   And so he probably does have some experience.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.560]   My gut would tell me as someone who has worked
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.240]   with a lot of clients and knows a lot of realtors,
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.920]   this is probably not someone who's actually
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.480]   going to be representing you.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.540]   He's going to have staff that are going to be handling
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.380]   a lot of it.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.880]   You're not going to be talking to Stanley.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.120]   And he's going to likely make up for a lack
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.160]   of negotiation ability and focus on saving you money
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.120]   or making you money if it's a listing with his personality.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.520]   So he's a great marketer.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.580]   And the top producing agents are always the best marketers.
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.320]   This is a problem in our industry.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.440]   The best agents don't make the most money.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.040]   The ones that are best at getting the phone to ring
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:57.880]   make the most money.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.960]   But that doesn't mean that they're the best
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.640]   when it comes to representing you.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.120]   - So you want someone that sold a lot of houses,
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.640]   but maybe you don't necessarily want the person
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.320]   who markets themselves as the person
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.160]   who sold the most houses.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.360]   And so it's not kind of that sweet spot
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.620]   of maybe like the 60th to 90th percentile,
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.440]   but not the very top.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.080]   - There's a lot of things people fall for.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.280]   I sell the most houses in this neighborhood.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.960]   Realtors will use that as a way of saying,
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.080]   "I'm the best. Don't fall for that."
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.840]   It makes sense to our perspective
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.680]   when we're listing the home,
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.120]   "Oh, you sell all the houses in the neighborhood.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.880]   You know how to get me top dollar."
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.880]   You just don't realize until you think about it,
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.360]   the buyers don't care.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.240]   The buyers don't care who's selling that house.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.640]   They are never going to look at who the listing agent is
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.480]   when they're writing their offer.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.000]   They just care about the house.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.920]   The buyer's agent needs to know the neighborhood.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.600]   The buyer's agent needs to know the amenities.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.360]   When you're looking to buy somewhere,
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.240]   you want an agent that knows the area very well.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.600]   When you're looking to sell,
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.480]   it will never matter how many homes in the area
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.320]   that agent sold.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.160]   In fact, the only reason they sell a lot of homes
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.560]   in the same area is they put their sign in all the yards
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.760]   and then they go, we call it farming,
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.140]   knocking on all the doors and meeting all the people,
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.400]   getting their name out there.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.360]   They're just able to utilize a listing
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.720]   to build leverage to get more,
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.360]   but there's no competitive advantage
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.080]   when it comes to representing a seller
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.120]   if you've sold other homes in the area.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.880]   - I wanted to add one thing to that.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.720]   Well, hey, it sounds like if they're putting signs
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.960]   in everyone's yard, it sounds like they're good marketers,
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.040]   which goes back to what you were saying.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.800]   But I did want to say that one really important piece
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.400]   to agents just from a consumer side
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.320]   and as someone that relies on agents pretty heavily
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.400]   is them having a really thorough Rolodex
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.320]   of vendors that I can use to help me run my properties,
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.680]   whether I'm living in it or not.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.120]   Like if I'm buying a short-term rental, for example,
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.440]   I know I need a contractor, cleaner, landscaper,
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.320]   pool maintenance person, pest control,
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.320]   and probably a plumber, electrician,
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.140]   and all that type of stuff.
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.320]   So when I'm calling a realtor,
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.600]   and this goes into how many houses have they sold,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.760]   if they've sold a lot of houses over the last five, 10 years
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.920]   they probably have a pretty thorough Rolodex.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.160]   I mean, outdated term.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.920]   If they use the term Rolodex, maybe they're not with it.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.560]   But if they have a very big contact list
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.100]   of all these different vendors,
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.200]   that's what I'm personally looking for in a realtor
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.240]   because a lot of the times,
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.680]   I really need a firsthand referral
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.120]   to know that I can successfully either live in a property
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.320]   or execute a rental.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.600]   - Yeah, that Rolodex is interesting.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.460]   It's something I never saw in the contract,
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.000]   but once you close, I was surprised
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   that even though it's not necessarily required,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.580]   a good agent will spend so much time
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.800]   helping make sure the process from,
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.560]   I closed to, I moved in, I got the yard done,
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.560]   I renovate, even renovated something.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.260]   They've been super helpful there.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.020]   We have a lot to go here,
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.240]   but I do wanna touch quickly on that negotiating piece
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.800]   that you mentioned earlier, David.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.240]   When someone's trying to get into this,
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.960]   what leverage or room is there for negotiating?
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.520]   I did what you suggested.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.240]   I went to the seller's agent and said,
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.080]   "Hey, I don't wanna mess around.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.140]   "I know I want this house.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.580]   "I don't need to go find another agent.
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.020]   "I feel good in negotiating.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.740]   "Will you work with me?"
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.940]   It ended up being a great situation
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.700]   because that agent got more commission
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.220]   and was a little bit more biased
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.580]   towards trying to get my purchase over the finish line.
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:10.580]   And in one case, rebated 1% of their fee back to me.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.640]   Are there other rooms for negotiation?
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.300]   Are there other tactics someone can use
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.460]   to get a better price or likelihood of getting accepted?
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.900]   - Well, the first thing you have to do is define a win.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.500]   So in a situation where the house is getting 10 offers,
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.300]   a win is just getting it at all.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.740]   There are times in the Bay Area or other hot markets
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.900]   with restricted supply and lack of inventory
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.100]   that you're just not gonna get a home, period.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.940]   It's incredibly hard to get in contract
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.740]   if you're competing with so many people.
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.820]   So in those situations,
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.140]   you're not gonna get a discount from your listing agent.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.260]   You're not gonna get a better price on the home.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.820]   You just have to get it.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.300]   Now, in other situations,
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.700]   which is what I try to target my clients into,
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.860]   I show them properties that less people are competing with.
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.420]   The listing photos are ugly.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.380]   It's been in contract.
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.580]   It fell out of contract.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.240]   Now the days on market have ticked up
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.420]   and people aren't looking at it anymore.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.260]   I look for opportunities to help them
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.460]   get into a property with much less interest
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.940]   and then we can get them a discount on the price.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.220]   We can save them some money there.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.580]   A mistake a lot of people make
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.980]   is they go to the listing agent
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.980]   of an incredibly hot property.
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.420]   They ask for a discount from the listing agent
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.580]   and they go, "No, there's like 12 other people
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.660]   "that wanna buy this house.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.220]   "I can get my client 100 grand more
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.340]   "going with a different offer.
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.700]   "I'm not gonna discount commission just to help you get it."
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.620]   So that's a big piece is knowing
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.960]   when you have leverage and when you don't.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.100]   - And I wanna talk about making that offer now, right?
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.780]   Like let's say someone's gone through this process.
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.900]   They've picked their agent.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.220]   They've figured out what they're doing
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.980]   and they find a house and they're trying to decide,
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:34.820]   is this a good house?
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.540]   So let's start with that before we get to the offer.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.140]   It's like you have a place in mind.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.980]   You're looking at this listing.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.540]   Maybe you do, maybe you don't have an agent yet,
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.040]   but what are the things that are really important
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.860]   for someone to be paying attention to
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.100]   when they're looking at a listing
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.340]   either online or in person?
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.660]   Rob, what do you look for?
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.860]   - I like to find stuff that needs a little bit of work,
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.840]   a little TLC personally on my end,
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.640]   just because I don't really like paying the premium
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.320]   of someone else's fine-tuned work
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.960]   that I probably don't like anyway.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.680]   So I don't wanna go in and usually do a full rehab.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.920]   That's not really my space,
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.960]   but I'm looking for something that I can really spice up
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.700]   with a nice paint job,
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.200]   maybe doing a lighter cosmetic renovation,
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.320]   like changing out the floors or something like that.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.280]   So I'm not necessarily looking for top tier.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.880]   I'm just looking for something that I can come in
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.760]   and add my touch to.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:24.900]   I don't really like paying
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.500]   for turnkey properties personally,
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.960]   but it all comes down to what your buy box is.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.680]   What about you, David?
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.360]   - In a hot market like where we are today,
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.880]   it's usually a good time to buy real estate
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.980]   because when there are more buyers
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.960]   than there are product to buy,
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.600]   the odds of prices increasing are favorable
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.080]   because you've got a favorable supply demand ratio there.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.640]   However, it becomes harder to get into the asset
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.840]   in those environments,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.200]   which is why most people get discouraged.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.240]   There's also an element where people aren't educated.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.260]   So they all chase after the same homes.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.560]   They want the ones with the best listing photos,
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.840]   the best locations.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.680]   They're moving ready.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.640]   That gives you that emotional tingle that you just love.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.480]   Those are the houses everyone looks for.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.720]   You're just looking for something
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.300]   that other people are gonna pass up
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.920]   that you see the value in,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.840]   that you're gonna put a little bit of elbow grease into.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.200]   Sometimes bad smells can really benefit you
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.040]   when you're trying to buy a home
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.320]   'cause it's gonna turn off a lot of your competition.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.260]   Ugly floor plans.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.120]   People don't realize it's usually not as expensive
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.880]   as you think to move walls around.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.260]   But when it's got a closed off kitchen,
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.320]   you can't see what's going on in the family room.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.340]   The wife's thinking, "I can't see what the kids are doing.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.200]   I just don't like it."
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.120]   That's as far as they go.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.400]   They don't realize that you can spend $2,000 and move a wall.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.240]   You can see everything that's going on there.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.640]   Then painting and flooring.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.760]   You can really...
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.960]   You can fix homes up for a lot less
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.280]   than what people think today.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.000]   But you have to see the opportunity,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.680]   not the move and ready product.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.280]   - How does how long the house has been
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.360]   on the market play into this?
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.360]   When you see something that's been on for a while,
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.440]   or we'll get to something that just came on after.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.360]   - Hey, I mean, it's just like online dating, right?
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.240]   I don't do online dating,
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.080]   but I know how the thing works.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.420]   If she's been single for six days,
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.960]   she's probably not in a rush to take your response
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.200]   and go out with you Friday.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.880]   But if she's been single for six months,
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.560]   she's probably gonna give you a little bit more attention
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.880]   when you send that message.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.400]   When a seller first puts their house on the market,
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.040]   they have all the leverage.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.320]   They have tons of interest.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.800]   People are going to look at their home.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.400]   Showings are being scheduled.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.720]   Agents are calling all excited.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.800]   "We really love the house.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.860]   Do you have any other offers?"
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.760]   It's this frenetic, crazy, emotional pace
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.040]   where the sellers are trying to think of,
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.720]   "How can I leverage this to get as much money as possible?"
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.760]   Which is really where I'm trying to guide my clients away.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.760]   I don't want you in that feeding frenzy.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.000]   If no one buys that house after 14 to 21 days,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.600]   interest is starting to slow.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.440]   By day 30, day 40, they're getting worried, okay?
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.800]   It's not, "Who's the best guy that I can take
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.160]   that gets to take me to prom?"
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.120]   It's, "Am I going to prom at all?
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.080]   I just want a date.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.440]   Does anyone want to buy my house?
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.640]   I'm stuck. I might not be able to move."
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.080]   And I write about this in some of the books
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.920]   that I've published for BiggerPockets for agents.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.280]   There's this spectrum of fear and greed.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.800]   We usually all start off on the greed side.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.880]   And as you slide across, you end up in the fear side.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.140]   You're worried, "I might not sell the house at all."
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.480]   So in most markets,
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.500]   depending on what your average day is on market,
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.480]   like this wouldn't apply in an area
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.920]   with $7 million homes that tend to sit on the market
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.560]   for six months before they sell.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.520]   But for your regular starter homes,
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.240]   they should be selling in less than 30 days
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.280]   in most markets in the country.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.520]   So the minute you get past that point,
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.800]   you're going to start seeing some worry in sellers
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.320]   and they will be open to more aggressive offers
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.960]   or terms that are more favorable to the buyer.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.520]   - What happens if you are in a hot market?
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.800]   And let's say, you've identified a neighborhood,
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.600]   you've looked, maybe a house comes on
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.660]   every two or three months,
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.240]   and you know, "This is what I want."
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.720]   You say, the moment that house comes on the market,
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.960]   it's hot, it's the worst time.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.120]   Is there a way to get ahead of that?
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.440]   Is there a way to find homes
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.240]   before they get on the market and buy them?
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.900]   Is that finding the right agent?
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.280]   Or how do you get what might be a hot home
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.660]   before it's hot?
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:53.560]   Rob, what have you been doing?
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.440]   You've gotten a couple of deals this way.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.040]   - Yeah, so there are definitely a few.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.280]   I mean, there's, let's see,
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.840]   there's the creative finance and the sub two deal, right?
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.200]   And that's effectively where you're cold calling
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.680]   a bunch of property owners and also wholesaling,
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.580]   where you cold call property owners
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.200]   and basically try to buy the property directly from them
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.240]   versus going the realtor route.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.500]   That's a very popular niche within real estate.
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.460]   But honestly, I think having a really big network
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.520]   of realtors that you're friendly with is super important.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.080]   And more than just having like a bunch of realtors
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.200]   in your network, finding a realtor that I see,
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.820]   and this is sort of where the marketing thing
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.520]   kind of comes into play too.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.800]   But finding a realtor that's very good at marketing
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.600]   and having a vast network of realtor friends
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.800]   that can pass each other deals to you
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.560]   or pass deals to each other,
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.280]   that to me is super important.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.180]   Because if you find someone that's like very new
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.360]   and very green in the industry,
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.540]   they probably don't have a lot
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.140]   of other real estate colleagues necessarily.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.220]   But if it's someone that's been working
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.860]   in the industry for a while,
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.940]   they have the opportunity to find all these deals
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.000]   before they ever hit the market.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.940]   So I have realtors that are texting me all the time
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.020]   that they're like, "Hey, my bud just sent me this.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.940]   "It's gonna hit the market next week."
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.220]   They're interested in selling it
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.540]   before even going to market.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.700]   Are you interested?
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.260]   And I'll look at a deal much quicker, much faster,
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.500]   and much more intentionally knowing
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.260]   that I've got first dibs on it.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.260]   - Do you think that applies for kind of consumer?
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.680]   Should I, if I'm looking to buy a home in a neighborhood,
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.080]   should I just talk to all the agents in the neighborhood
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.300]   and say, "Hey, I'm looking to buy a home.
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.360]   "There's nothing on the market I want right now,
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.620]   "but I just want you to know
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:26.800]   "if you can find me something, I'm ready to go."
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.760]   And just talk to 10 agents.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.040]   Do agents like that kind of behavior or?
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.060]   - Not really, yeah.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.120]   - No, not really.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.820]   'Cause you kind of send the message
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.840]   that you're looking for an open relationship
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.360]   and they're wanting a committed relationship.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.040]   So it doesn't benefit me as an agent if you come
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.960]   and you're talking to 12 agents in the years.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.480]   If you find me the deal, I'll buy it from you.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.760]   That sounds great, but I don't need to sell it to you.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.280]   If I get a listing, it's so hot right now,
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.140]   everyone's gonna wanna buy it, right?
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.840]   I don't have to discount my commission.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.920]   There's people that would probably give me extra commission
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.200]   if they wanted to get that home,
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.880]   or I wanna be able to go to my seller
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.640]   and tell them I got 10 offers on their home
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.240]   and I wanna look like a rockstar to them.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.040]   So I don't think the go wide instead of deep strategy works
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.720]   unless it's a buyer's market.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.860]   When you are in those situations where it's very difficult
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.040]   to find someone to buy a home, we're talking 2010
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.160]   when there was for sale signs everywhere.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.500]   Listings were all over the place.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.600]   REO inventory was massive,
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.120]   but there weren't a lot of pre-approved buyers
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.960]   that were willing to step in and buy a house.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.920]   Then that strategy makes a lot more sense.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.960]   That's where you're reaching out to all these agents saying,
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.640]   "Hey, if you get a deal, bring it to me and I'll buy it
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.840]   "because you're the prize in that situation."
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.240]   They need a buyer.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.080]   And you're basically saying,
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.040]   "Listen, I'm one of the few buyers that's out there
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:38.880]   "that could do this thing.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.560]   "But if you want my business,
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.400]   "you're gonna have to make it worth my while."
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.780]   That works a lot better than in a market like today
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.820]   where you're just one out of a whole bunch of other people
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.700]   that are all struggling to try to get a house.
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.540]   - Yeah.
[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.720]   I'm actually really glad you asked that, Chris.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.940]   And I'm glad you clarified, David,
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.780]   because Chris, for reference,
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.300]   I'm in about 16 different markets around the country.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.780]   So I actually have a massive network of realtors
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.900]   in different cities.
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.400]   They're all very aware of exactly what I'm looking for.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.100]   So when they get a pocket listing or an off-market listing,
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.500]   they text me directly.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.820]   When I'm working in a city specifically
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:11.860]   or in a market specifically,
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.340]   I do want just one realtor.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.540]   And that's why I say,
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:15.500]   "I wanna find a realtor
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.040]   "that's got a lot of realtor friends
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.660]   "that can help find some of those off-market deals."
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.140]   - So it's about finding someone that's connected.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.380]   Is that as simple as just seeing whose name pops up
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.900]   in a neighborhood most for sale signs?
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.620]   Like who represented most of the sales
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:31.520]   or any other tactics for finding that super connected agent?
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.120]   - I see why it would look that way.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.260]   But there are so many real estate agents, Chris.
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.200]   It's like the ones you see are the tip of the iceberg.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.420]   There's so many of them.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:42.700]   There's way too many agents.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.060]   We don't need this many.
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.300]   It reminds me of a scene in "The Office"
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.000]   where Dwight and Michael are walking through a crowded room
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.220]   and Dwight says, "There's too many people.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.500]   "We need another plague."
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.160]   There's just so many agents
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.820]   that have flooded into the real estate space.
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.060]   Like people coming to California in 1849
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.900]   thinking they're gonna strike gold.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.980]   They're all fighting to try to get that seller
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.860]   to think of them.
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.220]   It's just this massive marketing campaign
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.660]   that every agent is throwing themselves in front of people.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.140]   And now you've got investors
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.700]   that are also sending letters to those same people saying,
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.540]   "I wanna buy your house.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.900]   "I wanna buy your house."
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.340]   Most home sellers know in general,
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.700]   they have what everyone wants.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.700]   Their home is valuable.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.980]   You're probably not gonna put things in your favor
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.180]   by just talking to every real estate agent out there
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.300]   and saying, "Hey, I wanna buy a house if you get one."
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.300]   Because if they can get a listing, it's guaranteed to sell.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:34.460]   There's no reason they're gonna go to you particularly.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.140]   - And then this is a very short question,
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.460]   but it's important.
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.980]   How much does the brand behind the agent matter?
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.140]   Is it all about the agent
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:44.340]   or is it all about the agency they work at
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.900]   or the brokerage firm they work at?
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.860]   - The only people that think a broker matters is the broker.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.060]   Your clients never care who your broker is.
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.420]   It's 100% the agent.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.460]   - So if you're trying to find someone
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.620]   and they're like, "Oh, you can work with my colleague."
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.820]   That's like red flag.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.660]   - It used to be really useful, just a little history lesson.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.820]   Because there was a time where if you wanted to buy a house
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.980]   that RE/MAX was listing,
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.900]   you had to go to a RE/MAX agent at that office
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.140]   to buy that house.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.660]   So RE/MAX had their listings,
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.500]   Coldwell Banker had theirs, Century 21 had theirs,
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.660]   and you would jump from broker to broker
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.180]   and look at their inventory.
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.100]   When we created the multiple listing service,
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.700]   this was an agreement between all brokerages
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.060]   that they would all put their listings
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.700]   into one central location that everybody could see,
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.380]   which eventually morphed into the online listing portals
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.220]   that we all see when we're looking for homes.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.300]   That eliminated the value of going to an individual broker
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.100]   'cause now you can see everybody's inventory
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.420]   in the same place.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.140]   - And if people that you know had success
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.500]   using those kind of like online brokers
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.940]   that are like, "We're just gonna cut your rate
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.260]   "and give you a huge discounts."
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.100]   You know, I know Redfin does that.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.220]   Has anyone, have you heard success stories there?
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.340]   Is the savings worth it?
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.980]   - In our industry, Chris,
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.180]   I'm just gonna tell you the brutal truth.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.540]   I look for a Redfin agent
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.060]   to be on the other side of the transaction
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.620]   because I know I'm gonna destroy them in negotiation.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.780]   Because they don't make hardly any money on these deals.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.380]   They usually go there when they're desperate for food.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.380]   I'm starving, please Redfin, give me some deals
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.540]   or whatever the discount brokerage is.
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.420]   I've had massive success,
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.140]   particularly targeting listings that are Redfin listings
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:21.500]   because those Redfin agents are, not all the time,
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.260]   I'm sure there's gonna be a Redfin agent out there
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.940]   who's gonna say, "Well, I'm a Redfin agent and I'm good."
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.060]   Yes, they do exist, but in general,
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:27.900]   any of those discount brokerages--
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.620]   - I sell the most Redfin homes in this neighborhood.
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.580]   - Yeah, in fact, that might even be an advantage
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.220]   to tell people to look for those
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.100]   because your agent is going to have a field day
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.420]   with their agent if you have a good one.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.460]   - Yeah, and last tip.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.660]   I got one more tip here.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:48.500]   If the listing says, "Run, don't walk,"
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.380]   it's probably not that great of a listing.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.220]   - Oh, wow.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:53.940]   - We were just talking about this yesterday.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.940]   Every listing agent is putting that their house
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.260]   boasts of 5 bedrooms, boasts of amazing light,
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.740]   boasts of a great view.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.700]   These houses are just boasting all over the place.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.020]   - Bay Area real estate has become very arrogant.
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.380]   (both laughing)
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.500]   - That's funny.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.620]   - Oh, okay, so let's say we find this house.
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.340]   Whether it's a hot home,
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.540]   whether it's the home you're not sure about
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.820]   and you wanna rehab a little bit,
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.860]   what do you do when you've got someone
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.540]   and you're like, "I want this home,"
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.140]   or at least, "I wanna consider it,"
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.820]   and you're going through that diligence process
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.780]   of trying to figure out, doing inspections,
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.380]   how do you optimize that part of the process
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.100]   to make sure you're getting the right home
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:30.940]   at the right price?
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.180]   - The first thing for uninitiated to understand,
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.940]   writing an offer is not a commitment to buy a house.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.940]   A lot of people get stuck dragging their feet.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:38.820]   They don't wanna write an offer.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.020]   They need time to think about it.
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.420]   They need time to pray about it.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.660]   They need time to talk to their mom.
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.980]   They need time to analyze it.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.540]   By the time they get comfortable writing an offer,
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.620]   someone's already bought the house.
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.460]   This happens a lot of the time.
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.740]   When you write an offer,
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.580]   most of the time you will include a contingency,
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.620]   which is an allowance to back out of the deal
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.540]   and recover your earnest money deposit
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.420]   if you find something you don't like.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:01.100]   The main three contingencies are inspection contingencies,
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.540]   appraisals, and loans.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:03.660]   So if you can't get your loan,
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.100]   the house doesn't appraise at value,
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.540]   or something is revealed when you're inspecting the home,
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.380]   which can, in most cases, literally be,
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.460]   I looked at the front lawn
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.020]   and I didn't like the way the grass looked
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.020]   when I inspected it, I want out.
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.860]   You can use that contingency for just about anything.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.900]   It's okay to rush to put a house in contract
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.620]   and then slow down when you're in contract
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.100]   and order your pest inspection,
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.200]   order your home inspection, order your pool inspection,
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.260]   order your roof inspection,
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.220]   whatever it is that you're looking to do.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.700]   Take your time from that point,
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.160]   and if you decide you don't like the house,
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.700]   you want to back out, you can without penalty.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.820]   - And what about hot markets where there's no contingencies
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.660]   or people are saying,
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.820]   "We're not accepting offers with contingencies."
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.020]   Are there secret contingencies you can kind of put in?
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.020]   Are there ways to get out?
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:43.860]   Or what do you think about those?
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:44.900]   - Oh, man, you're going for the good stuff here.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:45.780]   There's a couple, right?
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.580]   Here's a couple of hacks that I'll share with you
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.280]   that normally you got to be my client
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.660]   if you want me to know this.
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.860]   There's a rule in California
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.580]   that once you receive the disclosures on a property,
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.660]   you have seven days to back out after receiving them.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.660]   It gives you time as a buyer to review these disclosures.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.460]   That is not a part of the contract that realtors use.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:08.500]   That is a state law that cannot be waived in a contract.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.380]   Many times listing agents,
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.180]   because like I said, they're not all good.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.360]   You get that discount agent,
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.340]   you get the person that hardly sells homes.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.140]   They're arrogant, like, "Oh, I'm going to sell this thing
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.420]   because everybody wants my listing,"
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.300]   but they don't know those little rules.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.020]   So we've had times with our clients
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.860]   where the listing agent did not provide
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.460]   the disclosures up front.
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.960]   They just didn't have their clients fill them out.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.120]   The clients didn't want to fill them out.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.860]   They didn't know why they were important.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.180]   If I see there's no disclosures,
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.940]   then they make me waive contingencies.
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.860]   I will put the house in contract,
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.020]   wait for them to give me those disclosures,
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.220]   and then the timeline starts.
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.140]   I have a certain amount of time after they've been...
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.820]   I'm trying to remember if it's three days or seven days.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.300]   I believe it's seven days, but I have three in my head.
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.520]   That might be something else.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.340]   Anyway, we then have a period of time to decide
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.220]   if we want to move forward on that house.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.660]   And we backed out and they said,
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.200]   "Well, you don't have an inspection contingency."
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.020]   We said, "Yeah, here's the disclosure law.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.420]   "There's nothing you can do about that."
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.140]   That's one loophole that we've looked for.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.740]   - That is...
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.620]   That's good.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.140]   You dirty dog.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.740]   Everybody, go back 30 seconds and listen to that again.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.580]   That is so good.
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.860]   I can see why you didn't want to necessarily
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.100]   say that on the podcast.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.900]   You don't want people to know.
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.980]   - That's exactly right.
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.780]   And so when I'm selling homes as a listing agent,
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.700]   we have our people fill these disclosures out.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.540]   And if you write an offer to buy the house,
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.940]   the first thing I do is say,
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.800]   "Review these before we even accept your offer."
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.880]   I want it to be signed that you've looked at them
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:30.040]   to start that timeline as fast as possible.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:30.880]   I also...
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.460]   It's why I want people to come to me to be their agent.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:33.300]   Because like I said,
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.760]   when you use an agent that doesn't sell a lot of homes,
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.640]   they don't know that.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.280]   And even more importantly, I know that they don't know.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.960]   And when I sense that as the agent,
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.620]   that's where I start shifting everything
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.560]   to protect my client.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.640]   Another one that people don't think about.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.000]   Usually when you buy a house,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.560]   you have a period of time to send in
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.640]   your earnest money deposit.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.960]   So there are certain times where there's two houses
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.800]   and you like them both
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.880]   and you don't know if you're gonna get one.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.400]   So you write offers on both houses
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.680]   and then you get lucky and end up with two of them.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.600]   Like, "What am I gonna do now?"
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.160]   Well, if you don't send the earnest money deposit in
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.300]   and you cancel the contract,
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.520]   there's really no recourse that the seller has
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.240]   to come back after you and say,
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.080]   "No, you have to give me money for this."
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.840]   There is no money in the escrow to take out.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.960]   So when you're a buyer,
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.720]   either put more money or put a longer period of time
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.160]   before you have to put in your earnest money
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.000]   and use that time to do your inspections,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.360]   do your praying, talk to your mom,
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.480]   go through your due diligence.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.600]   Or in some cases, I will admit,
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.520]   I bought houses out of state
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.960]   and the listing agent and the escrow company
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.480]   literally did not ever check to see
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.240]   if I sent the earnest money in.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.320]   I've closed on several houses in Tennessee
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.640]   that I never sent the earnest money for the entire escrow.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.080]   And nobody even asked about it.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.200]   I just sent the whole money in to close.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   And I was fascinated that that happened,
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.080]   but it probably happens in more markets
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.960]   than people think or with agents
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.320]   that aren't experienced selling houses
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.520]   like this hypothetical Redfin agent we talked about
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.560]   that doesn't even know they're supposed to check.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.400]   You might make it 10, 12, 14 days
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.560]   before an escrow officer realizes,
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.160]   "Oh, we don't have earnest money."
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.920]   And they contact your client about looking into it,
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.960]   which is plenty of time to get some of those inspections
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.400]   done without a contingency.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.240]   - I love that.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.120]   And it's funny because I took that strategy
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.400]   we mentioned earlier where I used the seller's agent.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.440]   And in fact, we made an offer
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.120]   and they set disclosures like two hours
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.280]   before we made the offer.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.600]   It's like quick cursory glance.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.480]   And fortunately, everything worked out,
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.680]   but I did not get reminded by the seller's agent
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.560]   that I might have some time to back out.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.720]   And I think that's one of the risks
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.960]   when you use the seller's agent
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.960]   is that they might give you a little bit of the edge
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.120]   to try to get the deal done
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.600]   'cause they might make a little bit more.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.280]   Not at the risk of kind of completely tanking
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.720]   the purchase price for their seller,
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.040]   but they're certainly not gonna try to come up
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.880]   with creative ways to save the deal and get you out.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.840]   Any other things when you're going through inspections,
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.240]   things that people often miss, things that you learn?
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.640]   I feel like every time, and it's only happened two times,
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.000]   but every time I bought a home, like 30 days later,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.560]   I'm like, "God, how did I miss that?"
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.560]   Any tips for finding all the that's?
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.440]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.400]   So I think one thing to keep in mind,
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.720]   and David kind of hit the nail on the head with this one
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.880]   is when you get into escrow,
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.080]   if it's your goal to get into a property,
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.800]   get into escrow as fast as possible.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.880]   I typically run two sets of analytics,
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.840]   especially with rental portfolios.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.200]   I have my back of the napkin analytics, right?
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.160]   Where I just wanna know, does this property feasibly work?
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.360]   If it kind of does, okay, great.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.560]   I go into escrow,
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.840]   and then I run my deep dive analytics for that, right?
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.720]   The reason I say this is because a lot of people,
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.520]   like David said, will spend so much time
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.040]   just getting analysis paralysis,
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.640]   and then they'll lose out on the deal.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.200]   One of those things that typically give me
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.120]   a lot of analysis paralysis back when I started
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.200]   was this little phrase in the listing that says,
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.080]   as is, seller not willing to make any repairs
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.200]   to the property.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.440]   And so that held me back from ever buying properties
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.640]   or ever making offers until I figured out
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.360]   that that really doesn't mean anything.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.880]   Really, you can buy a property as is,
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.280]   but David, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:10.000]   there's no actual legal paperwork that is signed
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.080]   that says that you can't actually ask for concessions
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.000]   because what's happened for me 100% of the time
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.760]   is I'll make the offer on an "as is" house,
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.400]   and then I get the inspection report.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.240]   And guess what?
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.000]   I asked the seller for $10,000 worth of repairs
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.760]   or a $2,000 credit or whatever, right?
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.720]   So just because something says as is
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.640]   doesn't necessarily mean that you have to take
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.560]   that at face value.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.440]   And that's something that I think a lot of people miss
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.400]   when they're buying their first or second or third property.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.960]   - 100% correct.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.120]   I laugh in the face of as is.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.360]   It means nothing, nothing!
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.600]   As is is a completely toothless claim.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.680]   When someone says, "I'm selling my property as is,"
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.520]   what they're saying is,
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.800]   "I don't want to make any further concessions."
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.920]   But no seller wants to make concessions.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.480]   It just doesn't matter anything.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.680]   The only time someone could say, "I'm selling a house as is,"
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.280]   is if you have no contingencies
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.800]   and your earnest money deposit is so high
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.600]   that you would not want to back out of that deal.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.240]   Because you could always back out of a deal,
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.760]   you'll just forfeit the earnest money
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.280]   and the seller will get to keep it.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.000]   So let's say, Chris, you asked earlier,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.360]   what if you just can't get contingencies
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.400]   and all the things we've mentioned,
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.920]   you don't have any wiggle room?
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.640]   What if you just make your earnest money deposit really low?
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.400]   Like, all right, no contingency, short escrow,
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.240]   I'll give you everything you want,
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.480]   $3,000 earnest money deposit.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.880]   You find something you don't like in the house,
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.600]   worst case scenario, you lose three grand.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.600]   No one loves it, but it's better than closing on a house
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.760]   that has a bunch of problems.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.240]   So don't ever believe as is.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.760]   Rob and I bought a house together, actually.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.560]   He kind of got to see behind the scenes
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.880]   of I was kind of working the negotiation
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.840]   through our realtor.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.960]   So it was like me telling Rob to tell our realtor,
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.040]   hey, say this.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.800]   And he saw some of the just the angles and the experience
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.960]   that when you've been through these escrows you develop,
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.000]   sellers always start off with a hard stance.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.520]   I'm not taking less than three and a half million.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.940]   And then three weeks, four weeks later,
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:01.960]   all of a sudden, three million
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.560]   is starting to look like a possibility.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.840]   I'm not giving them anything.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.440]   Well, we get these inspection reports
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.880]   and hey, your pool has got some issues,
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.240]   your landscaping has some issues,
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.600]   your roof has some issues.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.800]   It's going to be $75,000 worth of work
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.080]   that needs to be done.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.000]   You give them a week or two of sweating that out,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.960]   they start to think a little bit differently.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.880]   And so oftentimes when you're the buyer,
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.880]   you want to gather as much as you can
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.320]   about what's wrong with this property,
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.040]   present it to the sellers, and then wait.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.920]   Let them marinate in their worry
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.200]   that you're going to back out of the deal
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.800]   or you're going to find something else,
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.480]   and they're going to have to give you concessions.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.180]   The knee-jerk response is almost always no,
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.480]   I will not do it.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.640]   But if you wait long enough,
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.920]   those nos frequently turn into yeses.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.440]   So when I'm listing a house,
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.880]   I will have my client pay for a home inspection,
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.920]   which they never like doing because they're 500 bucks,
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.760]   but it saves you so much money, Chris.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.760]   You would ask for other hacks that when you're in escrow.
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.600]   Anytime there's a inspection that's done,
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.880]   the perspective is as crazy as this is,
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.920]   is the buyer's buying a house in perfect condition.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.160]   And if anything's wrong with it,
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.160]   they deserve a credit or they deserve repairs.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.440]   They deserve something to put this house back
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.160]   into perfect condition.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.080]   Frequently, the house is in much better shape
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.240]   than other houses in the neighborhood,
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.640]   but they still use that inspection to get a discount.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.200]   Short answer is if you are buying a house
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.600]   and it's not a situation where they have another buyer
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.440]   willing to pay more than you in backup position
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.760]   who's going to jump right in there, anything absent that,
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.160]   you can ask for credits.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.840]   You can get a significant chunk
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.000]   of your closing costs paid for by the seller.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.020]   If you wait long enough into the escrow before you ask,
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.800]   almost regardless of the condition of the home.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.680]   So when I'm selling houses,
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.240]   that's how I get people to waive the inspection contingency.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.140]   You're going to get a home inspection paid for.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.840]   We're going to give that to the buyer up front.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.160]   We're going to say, here's what it looks like.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.040]   Here's all the reports.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.660]   If you don't like it, find another house.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.400]   But if you want this house, this is what you're buying.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.800]   And you're going to waive those contingency.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.620]   So when you're selling, that's what you want to do.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.120]   When you're buying, you want to avoid it.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.240]   And then one practical thing to look for
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.600]   that everybody misses
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.860]   is what we call the sewer lateral connection.
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.640]   So there is a sewer line that runs from your home
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.040]   out to usually the sidewalk
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.480]   where it connects to the city sewer line.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.280]   Those plumbing lines, if it's an older home,
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.540]   usually we're like running through the front yard,
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.800]   can become infiltrated by tree roots.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.940]   This is a crazy thing.
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:15.620]   But when the roots are just pushing
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.860]   against that PVC pipe for years,
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.040]   they will eventually push through there
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.480]   and then the roots will grow
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.520]   and these sewer lines can become clogged
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.280]   and they're very expensive to fix.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.880]   So one thing I tell every home buyer who's trying,
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:28.720]   like, what could I miss?
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.840]   What's the that thing that I might've missed?
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.200]   Get that sewer line scoped by a plumber
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.320]   before you buy the house,
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.400]   during your due diligence,
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.440]   and make sure that there aren't any clogs
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.520]   'cause those skins can be 10, 15 grand a fix
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.020]   when they get messed up.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:44.880]   - Yeah, that did happen to me.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.520]   We did a sewer scope.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.680]   There was a problem with the sewer.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.200]   They sent out the plumber to quote-unquote fix the sewer.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.040]   And we asked for the sewer scope
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.520]   like an hour before closing.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.140]   And they're like, "Oh, we didn't do one."
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.760]   But everyone's hands were sort of tied.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.200]   It was December 31st.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.960]   We were all trying to close it that year.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:03.640]   It was gonna mess everybody up.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.680]   So we were just like, "All right.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.760]   "Well, I mean, if they fixed it,
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.680]   "then in theory, we should be good."
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.680]   My wife moved in with our two kids.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.800]   And then that week, ramen noodles and poop
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.760]   show up in our bathtub and it was a whole thing.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:19.320]   And so lawyers got involved and it was a whole thing.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:23.120]   And basically what happened was the seller's agent
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.040]   lied to us about the repair
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.720]   and basically never even told the plumber kind of thing.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.840]   And so because we didn't get it re-scoped
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.800]   and while we didn't do it, while they owned it,
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.400]   it became a whole problem for us.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.640]   So I would say, from a sewer scope standpoint,
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.960]   if you do have to make repairs,
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.200]   make sure you pay for two sewer scopes.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.120]   - And what do you guys think about inspections
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.360]   when the seller's already done the inspections
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.600]   and they're in the disclosures?
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.680]   And it's, yeah, I remember when we bought this house,
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.960]   the disclosures were like, "Here's the building report.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.020]   "Here's the roof inspection.
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.400]   "Here's the termite inspection."
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.840]   Like they were all there.
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.360]   Do you still recommend people go do them themselves also?
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.360]   - Usually not.
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.680]   Like the fear is, "Well, that's the seller's inspector."
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.520]   But the inspectors themselves are licensed professionals
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.100]   that don't really care who the seller is, who the buyer is.
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:12.440]   They just wanna make sure they don't miss anything
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.880]   so they don't get sued.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.920]   So what I tell my clients
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.960]   when you're getting inspections someone else has done
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.600]   is call the home inspector and ask them like,
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.760]   "You can actually do that,
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.620]   "especially if you're the one who pays for the inspection.
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.300]   "But even if you're not, hey, I see in your inspection
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.420]   "line 9C2 shows this.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.180]   "Is that something I should be worried about?"
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.700]   You get great information from home inspectors.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.660]   They give you the context that's often missing,
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.800]   especially 'cause when you're first buying a house,
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.060]   or even if you've owned a lot of houses,
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.100]   like Rob, you could probably admit,
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.740]   we don't know what a lot of that stuff means.
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.300]   You see a report and it lists something,
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:45.580]   you're like, "Well, is that a bad thing or not a bad thing?"
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.420]   Just ask them, "Do you see this very frequently?
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.020]   "Oh yeah, every house has that issue
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.460]   "with the trusses in the attic or whatever the cases are."
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.100]   No, that's very concerning.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:56.580]   That electrical system should not be wired that way.
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.220]   I rarely ever see that.
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:48:59.580]   That's a big problem.
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.440]   So having those conversations with the person
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.400]   that inspected the house, and then specifically asking,
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.320]   "Is this a common problem or is this concerning to you?"
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.200]   Or maybe, "When you looked at the house,
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.940]   "what stuff from this report stood out to you
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:12.860]   "in your experience?"
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.000]   Now you're getting 20 years of experience
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.660]   to that home inspector's perspective,
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.040]   benefiting you as the person buying the house.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:20.880]   - I like it.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.660]   I'm gonna rapid fire through a few things quick
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.720]   that I've done in this part of the process.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.940]   One, we did get an inspection
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.300]   that said that there were termites.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.360]   I got another inspection and found someone
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.540]   that was willing to crawl through a smaller hole
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:34.300]   than the original inspector was
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:37.220]   to figure out what was wrong and find local treatment
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.380]   that was gonna be less expensive.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.060]   So I think anytime an inspection reveals something
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:42.100]   that could be expensive,
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.540]   it could be worth doing a second one.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:47.120]   Another one is, I'm trying to figure out
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:50.020]   when we're trying to buy a home what the person cares about,
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.600]   because sometimes there's sellers
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.380]   that really just wanna close fast.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.940]   Some want the most money.
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.340]   Sometimes someone might just wanna make sure
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:00.820]   that the house is gonna be taken care of by a good family.
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.580]   I find that if I could figure that out,
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.160]   either through the agent or some other way,
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.620]   maybe from some neighbors,
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:09.220]   sometimes we ask the neighbors about the sellers,
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.820]   you could try to optimize what you're doing.
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:14.580]   'Cause if all you want, if you know what's important to them,
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:16.220]   if they care about fast close,
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:18.940]   then maybe that's the thing you optimize for.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:21.680]   And my brother-in-law's tip was always,
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.240]   it's a lot easier to extend a fast close than you think.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.980]   So if you say we're gonna close in 30 days,
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:29.280]   you need to push it back by day 30, it's a lot easier.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.940]   I'm gonna throw a couple little things
[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:33.400]   that I've thrown in contracts
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.120]   or learned and regretted not doing.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.440]   I'm curious if there are any last things
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.520]   that you try to negotiate for.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.480]   For me, I always had this rule when I bought a car
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.820]   that's like try to get them to throw in the floor mats.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.880]   And for the home, I always love getting a little extra
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:46.760]   at the end of the deal,
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.160]   because you're looking at a house
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.500]   that the cost to throw in a few things is so small
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.880]   that even if someone's not willing to negotiate,
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:53.920]   you could sometimes get it.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.920]   So we got all the lime trees
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.520]   that were technically staging included in our house.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.720]   There was a nice stage TV in the living room,
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.720]   we got that thrown in.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.880]   So I always like to throw in a little bit
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.080]   of few small things that at the end of the day,
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.160]   no one's gonna kind of blow a deal up over something small,
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.200]   but it feels really good.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.880]   Every time we walk through our living room,
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.720]   like I didn't pay for that TV, like that TV was free.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.400]   Yeah, I paid for the TV, I bought the house,
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.720]   but I feel like I didn't pay for the TV.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.060]   And one that I've recently come across,
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.240]   so depending on how much you care about privacy and whatnot,
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.240]   I'm now in a situation where I'd prefer
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.000]   the whole world doesn't know where I live.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.640]   And so one thing that you can do in advance,
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.120]   because it's a lot of work if you don't,
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.400]   is put into the contract that the agent needs to remove
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.360]   all of the home data, photos, descriptions from the MLS.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.780]   Sometimes it can be a hassle
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.700]   to get them to go do it after the fact,
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.080]   but if you don't want all the pictures
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.400]   of the interior house online,
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.800]   you can write that into a contract,
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.880]   which is something that took me time,
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:52.800]   but I didn't do it in advance.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.560]   And if you really wanna be private
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.000]   and you wanna buy a home in an LLC
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.800]   so that you kind of protect your identity where you are,
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.960]   you can't do that later.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.480]   Like the records will always be there
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.720]   if you didn't do that in advance.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.400]   So if you're in a situation where you think one day
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.240]   in the near future,
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.600]   you might not want people to find your address,
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.760]   buy the home in the LLC in advance.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.820]   Don't buy it after,
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.140]   don't try to change that after the fact.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.260]   'Cause I have at least one friend
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:18.860]   who ended up just having to move
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:20.740]   because someone knew where his address was
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.180]   and there wasn't really anything he could do at that point.
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:24.380]   So those are a couple of mine.
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:26.300]   Any other small, quick wins
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.060]   that you can get when you're negotiating?
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.860]   - No, I think those are all pretty good.
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.700]   I think we covered basically everything.
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.460]   We talked about seller credits.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:36.940]   I think it's important to note
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.460]   that you can have a little bit of flexibility
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:40.380]   with seller credits.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:43.120]   Like let's say you can't see eye-to-eye with the seller
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.720]   and they don't want to give you a $5,000 seller credit
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.480]   to repair this one kind of thing
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.200]   that you think is a big deal.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.040]   You could, in theory, raise the price by $5,000
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.760]   and then have them give you a credit for $5,000.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.140]   And while they're not paying it for you,
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.000]   throwing that onto your mortgage
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.860]   is really gonna have a pretty minimal effect
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:01.960]   on your overall payment.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.360]   I mean, probably less than a dollar is my guess.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:05.200]   I don't really know.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.840]   But that's always something you can do too
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.420]   if you need to make a deal work
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:10.380]   and you're really like, "Hey, this $5,000
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.760]   "is gonna kill the deal."
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.120]   You can always add it to the price of the house
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.080]   if you feel like you're getting a good enough deal.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.040]   - That's a good strategy,
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.800]   especially if you don't have a ton of capital.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.600]   In general, having 5, 10, 15 grand in the bank
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.320]   is more value to you than having 5, 10, or 15 grand
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:27.520]   added on to a $600,000 mortgage balance.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.040]   When it comes to extras that you mentioned, Chris,
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.080]   one of the best things to do is to have your agent
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.320]   ask the listing agent,
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.680]   "Is there anything that the sellers
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:36.560]   "don't want to have to move?"
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.220]   You wouldn't think that would be a common thing,
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:42.060]   but many times, sellers, their biggest concern is,
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.860]   "I don't want to move all my crap."
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:46.240]   And if they don't want to take the bunk beds with them,
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.380]   or they have some patio furniture in the backyard
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:49.980]   that they were planning on replacing
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.060]   when they got something new,
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.780]   or they don't really love their couch,
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.940]   it's not worth moving because they have to spend
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.280]   a bunch of money to get it from one place to another,
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.580]   they may be happy to leave it for you.
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:01.140]   So just getting a list from them
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:02.900]   or what are all the things you don't want to take
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:05.600]   regarding furniture or stuff like that
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.620]   is something that you can get added.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:09.940]   Like what you mentioned, Chris,
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.480]   sometimes there's TVs that they were just gonna get
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.100]   a new TV when they got to the new house,
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:15.740]   and you can have that added
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:17.700]   and just end up with some extra things
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.780]   to throw throughout the house.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:19.940]   Doesn't hurt to ask.
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:20.780]   - Love that.
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:21.620]   Rob, you talked about mortgages.
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.540]   Let's talk quickly about financing.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.820]   I know it's a big thing.
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.540]   Anything people need to be thinking about
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:30.140]   as they go through this process, getting a loan,
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.980]   getting pre-qualified, figuring out what they can afford?
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:34.220]   - Yeah, I think probably the first,
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:35.840]   I mean, there's a couple ways to look at it, right?
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.240]   So if you're buying conventionally,
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.760]   they're typically gonna look at what's called
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.500]   your debt-to-income ratio.
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:41.920]   So this is how much money you're paying
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.800]   every single month to debt servicers
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.480]   versus how much income you make.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.640]   Now, I believe this is gross income.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.520]   So let's say you make $10,000 a month,
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.320]   but all of your credit cards and your student loan payments
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:56.240]   and your car payments and the couch that you finance
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.360]   adds up to 4,500 bucks a month.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:02.140]   That means that your debt-to-income ratio is 45%.
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:04.680]   And David, you probably know the exact number here,
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:07.460]   but typically lenders don't want you to have higher
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:10.600]   than a 45% DTI to make a deal work.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.800]   Is that the correct figure, David?
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:13.960]   - It's sometimes lower than that,
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.600]   but that's the ceiling as high as most of them will go.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.620]   So you wanna make sure that when you're analyzing a deal
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.280]   and seeing what you can qualify for,
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.040]   I mean, all lenders are basically gonna run
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.800]   this calculation for you.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.560]   But just to put it into perspective,
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.040]   you don't want the payment of the house that you're buying
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.660]   to throw your DTI out of whack, right?
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:35.460]   If you're barely qualifying now,
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:36.660]   the debt that you're gonna have
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.220]   from the house that you're buying
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.820]   contributes to that DTI and what you're qualifying for.
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:42.660]   So make sure that that's something
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.900]   that you can kind of hone in ahead of time.
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:47.120]   And certainly don't go take out new credit cards
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:50.060]   and fill them up to buy new furniture before you close.
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:53.460]   That's a big mistake that I think a lot of people make
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:54.900]   on their first property.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.580]   - Yeah, opening any line of credit
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.400]   is gonna screw up your debt-to-income ratio.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.900]   And it often happens once the house is in escrow,
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:03.620]   now let's buy a new car to drive into our new garage.
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:05.700]   Let's go open a line of credits to buy a bunch of furniture.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:06.620]   You're so excited.
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:08.700]   And then the entire escrow gets blown up
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.300]   because you were just at the peak
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.140]   of what you could afford
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:13.100]   if that new line of credit put you over.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.020]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm a big fan of the points game
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.960]   and opening up cards and sign up bonuses.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.940]   But when we're buying a home,
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:21.300]   it's like, let's put a hold on all of that,
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:23.140]   six months out just so I kind of have
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.780]   a nice clean slate there.
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.880]   And I'm not trying to take on any extra inquiries
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.980]   or anything like that.
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.740]   - When you're helping people find homes
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:32.900]   and look or looking for mortgages yourself,
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:35.020]   do you think a broker is an important part
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:35.980]   of that equation or not?
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.300]   It's something I've never actually worked with.
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:39.220]   I've always gone direct
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.220]   to a handful of financial institutions.
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.760]   - Yeah, and disclaimer, I am a mortgage broker,
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.700]   so I am partial towards them.
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.260]   But here's why I went that route
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.060]   instead of becoming what we call direct lenders.
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.980]   So what a lot of people do is they'll go to Wells Fargo,
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.660]   they'll go to Chase, they'll go to Bank of America,
[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.860]   and they'll say, "What can you do?
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:55.700]   What's your rate?
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:56.520]   What are your closing costs?"
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.880]   And it gives you this feeling of productivity
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.540]   that you're out there shopping around.
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:01.820]   But as a broker, we're doing the same thing.
[00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:03.740]   We're going to Bank of America, we're going to Chase,
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:05.700]   we're going to all the same lenders you have,
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:08.460]   but they're probably giving us better pricing than you.
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.940]   And this is one of the kind of like the shady things
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:12.660]   about how the loan industry works.
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:14.380]   When you walk into Bank of America,
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.060]   'cause that's where you bank and you know them
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.420]   and you're comfortable with them,
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:19.100]   they know that you're gonna bank with them
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:19.980]   because you're comfortable.
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:21.720]   They don't have to give you the best deal.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.620]   But when they're working with a broker,
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.200]   they know that we are comparing them
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.540]   to all the other lending options,
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:28.360]   so they're gonna have to give us a good deal
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.740]   to get the business.
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:34.400]   So going to a broker will allow you to have them shop
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.800]   for all your different loan products
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.460]   and options that are available, save you time,
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:39.580]   and they're usually gonna get better pricing.
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:42.940]   - Can a broker still get deals where they're required
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.000]   to put a certain amount of assets at that institution?
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.100]   I know, at least with Wells Fargo, as your example,
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:49.900]   if you move some money into a brokerage account
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:51.940]   with Wells Fargo, you get a better rate.
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:54.980]   Do brokers still negotiate those kinds of deals as well?
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:56.700]   - Those are uncommon now.
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:58.400]   We were seeing those with jumbo loans.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.020]   There was a time where you could get a better rate
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:02.340]   on a jumbo loan if you put a significant amount of money
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:03.620]   in with the bank.
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:04.860]   And we would just tell our clients like,
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:07.100]   "Hey, if you're looking for a jumbo loan in this market,"
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:07.940]   it's not the case right now,
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:09.860]   but at the time, especially during COVID,
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:11.500]   you're better off just to go to that bank.
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:13.620]   You're gonna get a better rate on jumbo products
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:14.460]   than you would be right here.
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:16.580]   But you're gonna have to put 100 grand in a bank.
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:17.820]   They're gonna schedule a meeting for you
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:19.100]   with one of their financial advisors
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.540]   'cause they want you to take that 100 grand
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:21.900]   and go buy mutual funds through them
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:23.660]   and they're gonna make money that way.
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:25.620]   So if you get an honest broker,
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.220]   we don't wanna waste our time working on somebody
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:29.980]   who we can't get them a good loan product.
[00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:32.780]   We're pretty good at just telling people upfront,
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:35.780]   "For what you wanna do, we don't have a product like that."
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:37.640]   For years, we didn't do commercial lending.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.660]   So we would refer people to the best commercial lender
[00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:42.020]   we knew and so we got set up with a commercial lender
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:42.860]   and now we can do it.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:46.620]   So if you do have one of those special opportunities,
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:49.120]   sometimes physicians can get special loans
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:52.100]   through a credit union that is geared towards physicians.
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:55.540]   Yes, there's an angle, but for your average person,
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:56.980]   there's not a ton of those opportunities.
[00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:58.500]   - And David, just for reference,
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:01.940]   how much is, what makes something a jumbo loan?
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:03.060]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:04.820]   Every area has a different,
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.600]   what they call it like a conforming limit.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:07.880]   This is how much you can borrow
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.340]   before it's considered to be risky.
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:13.260]   So a mortgage broker or a loan officer can tell you
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.580]   what the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac guidelines are
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:16.540]   for that area.
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:18.260]   You might even be able to look that up online.
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:20.260]   But a loan balance above a certain amount,
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.740]   depending, it's obviously higher in the Bay Area,
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:25.500]   California than it's gonna be in Topeka, Kansas.
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.100]   But it's a proportional amount.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:29.700]   And then once you have to get a loan balance
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:30.520]   higher than that,
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.660]   you're not gonna get a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac loan.
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:35.160]   You're gonna get a loan that comes from private investors
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.540]   that have pooled their money in capital markets.
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:38.380]   They're going to give you the loan
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:39.500]   that they're going to sell that
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:41.180]   as a mortgage-backed security somewhere else.
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:42.940]   So that's why the rates are usually a little bit higher
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:43.780]   on jumbo loans.
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:46.540]   They're riskier for the person lending you the money.
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:47.380]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.420]   - I think the Bay Area, it's like high six figures.
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:50.260]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:51.820]   - Is the threshold, I think.
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:53.820]   - Yeah, it goes up every year, usually, too.
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:56.300]   - Okay, yeah, it's been a few years for me.
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.140]   And how do you think about
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.620]   how much people should be putting down?
[00:59:58.620 --> 00:59:59.580]   Or maybe if you have a different thing,
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.340]   you can drop us your thoughts on that.
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:04.100]   - I think it's gonna probably depend on the use case, right?
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.700]   So if it's a primary, you can get into a primary
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.840]   for as low as 3.5% down.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:12.260]   Unless it's a jumbo loan, I don't think you can do that.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.700]   There are limits on those as well,
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.620]   the FHA Fannie Mae guidelines.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:16.580]   So make sure to look those up.
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.180]   Those are pretty easy to look up.
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.100]   - I think it's totally fine to get into your starter home
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.340]   for 3.5%.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.180]   I did.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.840]   I got into my first $159,000 house
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.820]   for like six or seven grand.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:30.540]   And that house ended up being the catalyst
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.180]   for my entire portfolio.
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.660]   I think if you're looking at investment properties,
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.620]   you could go as low as 10% with a second home loan.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.860]   That's still gonna be under your name and your income
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.060]   and everything like that.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:42.580]   And then once you go that traditional route,
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.940]   if you're going more traditional real estate,
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.700]   20% down seems to be the gold standard.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:51.340]   You could, sometimes it's gonna be asked that you do 25%.
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:54.560]   Not really a fan of putting 25% down personally.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.220]   If I can get in for 10% on a second home loan,
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.220]   pretty happy.
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.940]   I'll do 20% though on an investment loan.
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.380]   That seems to be more common these days.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.900]   - So I like to put that into an apples to apples comparison.
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:10.140]   In general, if you're an investor
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:11.700]   or like a real estate investor,
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.660]   having more capital is better,
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:14.980]   but it depends where interest rates are.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:18.180]   So for example, when the rates are at 6%,
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.620]   to save an extra $40,000
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.020]   and put that towards your down payment
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:25.020]   is gonna save you $240 a month.
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.620]   When rates were at 3%,
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.740]   it would only save you $169 a month.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.100]   So we saw this phenomenon
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:33.660]   where people were trying to save more money
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:35.780]   to get their payment lower, get their payment lower,
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.780]   but prices were rising faster than they could save money.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:41.380]   It actually ended up being a poor financial decision
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.740]   to try to save more money to put money down.
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:47.060]   So if rates, you know, if they jump up to say 12%,
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:52.340]   now you're talking about $411 a month.
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.460]   That might make sense to put more money down,
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.660]   but interest rates though, they're higher than they were.
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:59.540]   They are still traditionally very low
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.220]   compared to where they've been for a long time.
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:02.260]   So putting more money down
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.100]   doesn't help you as much as you'd think.
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:04.940]   - And don't forget, you know,
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:08.700]   up to $750,000 of mortgage interest deductible
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.100]   as a primary residence.
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:12.740]   So that mortgage interest comes off, you know,
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.900]   a little bit in your tax return.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.060]   Obviously, I'm not an accountant.
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:16.620]   Feel free to talk to a CPA.
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:20.540]   And then a hack for anyone who's making large purchases
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:23.380]   and has lots of money that isn't talked about too often,
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:26.060]   but I'll share on the personal side is that
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:30.900]   if you borrow money and you use that money to invest
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:35.700]   in anything, whether it's stock market, bonds, whatever,
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.180]   that interest is deductible as investment interest expense.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.420]   Again, not a CPA, talk to your lawyer.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.340]   I'll put a link in the show notes.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.260]   But so I know people that have been able to, you know,
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:48.620]   buy a house in cash and then recoup, you know,
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:51.260]   do the mortgage a day later
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.300]   and then take that mortgage and invest it.
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:56.980]   So one thing we did to kind of do this strategy
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.580]   a little bit was we liquidated
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.180]   a lot of our personal investment savings,
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:03.340]   bought more of the house than we could,
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.100]   and then immediately financed more of it
[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:07.980]   and put that money back in our investment account.
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.620]   And by doing that, we could go over
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.700]   the deductible mortgage interest limit
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.780]   because that extra mortgage interest
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.340]   was actually being classified as investment interest
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.420]   because it was being used for the purpose of investing.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.540]   So I'm not gonna go down that rabbit hole,
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:25.500]   but, you know, I know people who have, you know,
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.580]   multi-million dollar mortgages that are 100% deductible.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.180]   And you could deduct that interest
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.620]   against investment returns and investment gains,
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:34.300]   whether it's capital gains or interest income
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.260]   or anything like that.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:37.980]   There's also a ton of awesome tax hacks
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.620]   when it comes to commercial property.
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:42.460]   I know you guys did an episode all about the way
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:45.900]   to do real estate and not pay taxes
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:47.820]   when you're doing it for investment properties.
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:48.940]   I don't remember the episode number,
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.620]   but we'll link to it in the show notes for sure,
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.220]   because I know you guys have gone deep on that
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.100]   on the commercial side.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.860]   But there is a hack here if you have cash on hand,
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:59.100]   or even if your house is appreciated and you have equity,
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.300]   you can refinance, take cash out of your house.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.420]   And as long as you invest that cash out refinance money,
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:09.060]   that extra mortgage interest will also be usually,
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.980]   talk to your CPA,
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.060]   classified as investment interest expense and be deductible.
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:14.260]   Yeah, you can write off the interest
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.700]   and you don't get taxed on the money that you took out.
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:17.540]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.460]   - I will say, I actually remember the episode
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.340]   off the top of my head.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.140]   I have every single episode memorized.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.500]   It was 689, our "Bigger Pockets" episode
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.060]   with Matt Bontrager, who is an awesome CPA.
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:30.860]   - So there's probably a lot more we could do.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.740]   I could, in fact, probably do an entire episode
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.620]   on each one of these topics we went to.
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.100]   And maybe that's the follow-up,
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:39.380]   is we have a series of extra deeper, deeper dives
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.340]   on each one.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:43.060]   But I wanna get to, you've closed on this.
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.620]   Now we've got the financing, we closed.
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.500]   Any last things that you need to be thinking about?
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.020]   We made an offer, we secured our loan
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.980]   as we're wrapping up the process of buying home.
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.980]   Is there anything else there?
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.340]   Or is it really just kind of closes
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.620]   and that's all that happens?
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:58.660]   - You know what, David, you actually,
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.500]   you gave a very good tip the other day
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.900]   about keeping your documents into one place.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:03.900]   You think you could run us through that?
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.100]   Because when you said it, I was like, "Oh my God."
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:06.940]   It's so easy.
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.060]   Why doesn't everyone do this
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.140]   before they apply for a mortgage?
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:10.980]   - So when you're getting ready
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.460]   to buy a house in the first place,
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.300]   a lot of people hate the pre-approval process.
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.140]   It's like pulling teeth.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.580]   You have to go get your pay stubs,
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.060]   you have to get bank statements,
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.740]   you have to find your tax returns.
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:22.260]   Well, who knows where their tax returns are most of the time?
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.780]   And if you're not used to navigating
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.980]   your company's HR website to get pay stubs,
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.940]   it can take three hours to figure that thing out.
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:29.340]   It's very frustrating.
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:31.180]   So the advice that I give to all of our clients
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:32.420]   and what I do myself,
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:35.020]   I create a Google folder in Google Drive
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.060]   with that information.
[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:37.940]   And I just, when I download those documents,
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.460]   I stick it in that folder.
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:41.500]   And that way, if you decide that you wanna get pre-approved
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.420]   with several different lenders,
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:44.020]   if you're gonna use the method like Chris was saying,
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.260]   where you're talking to different people,
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:46.740]   you're sending the same stuff to everybody.
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:47.940]   It's really easy.
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.540]   Then when I close on a house,
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:52.620]   I open another Google Drive folder for every address.
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.420]   And I keep all the information
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.660]   for every house in that folder.
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:58.820]   It is incredibly simple when you do it.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.860]   So we get our loan documents, I stick it in there.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:03.260]   All the inspection reports, I stick it in there.
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.620]   The disclosures for the house, they're gonna go in there.
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:08.220]   The mortgage note, every piece of information,
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.500]   the property management agreement,
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.780]   if I'm gonna manage the property,
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.220]   the work from the contractor,
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:14.260]   the scope of work and how much I paid them.
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:16.780]   Whatever it is, it all goes in that same folder.
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:17.780]   And then if I ever need it,
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:19.820]   I know exactly where to go to get it.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.020]   - I love that.
[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:23.220]   I did not do that in the first house.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.420]   And you had to go back and track down the mortgage docs.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.140]   And I was surprised that just because you sign
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:29.860]   a lot of these mortgage docs in person,
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.260]   I didn't get a copy without requesting them
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:34.780]   as an attachment in my email.
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.780]   It was in some secure thing that wasn't easy to access.
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:38.620]   That's one.
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.860]   And then the last other thing I put in that folder.
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.340]   So now I have that folder.
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:44.060]   I would say, put a Google sheet in that folder,
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.140]   Excel file, whatever.
[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:47.860]   And every time you make any expenditures
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:50.460]   to improve the house, make sure you write it down
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.660]   because we just did a renovation
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.420]   and that kind of sparked this idea.
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:57.780]   But at the end of the tenure at a house,
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:58.620]   when you sell it,
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.460]   you take the amount that you made
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.460]   from the house selling it,
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.340]   you subtract the amount that you spent to buy it.
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.220]   And that's your kind of gain on the house,
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:06.980]   but you can deduct all the improvements
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:08.380]   you made to that house.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.660]   And so it might seem small at the beginning,
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.300]   maybe you just redid some floors,
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:14.580]   but those things add up over the life of the house.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:15.700]   And I think it's really helpful
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.180]   if just right as soon as you close,
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:20.140]   you have one place you can start to track every improvement
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.420]   and every expense you put to improve that house
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:25.460]   so that you can save on the taxes at the end.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:26.940]   - And if you ever want to sell that house,
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.340]   as something you can show the next buyers of the property,
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:30.620]   here's all the improvements that we made
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.580]   over the time we had the home and here's the receipts.
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.220]   - Speaking of tracking all this stuff
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.380]   and storing documents,
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.780]   there's one thing after you buy this house
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:39.740]   that's very important
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.540]   is to make sure you get that house insured.
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:44.260]   And I just did a really deep dive on insurance.
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.940]   I went through every policy,
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:47.820]   talked to multiple brokers, multiple companies.
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:48.660]   I tracked a lot.
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.780]   I probably spent 50 hours on insurance.
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:53.820]   And I wanted to share a few things.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.900]   Any thoughts from you guys quick on insurance
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:57.140]   or should I jump in?
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:57.980]   - No, let's do it.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:59.900]   But I do want to say I listened to it, dude.
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:03.180]   I mean, it is clear you put 50 hours of research into it.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.340]   And as the keeper of all the episodes,
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.300]   you can find that episode of all the hacks.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.820]   That's number 104.
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.900]   So make sure to go listen to that after you listen to this.
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.700]   Make that be the first thing you listen to
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.100]   'cause I promise you it will answer all of your questions
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.580]   as it pertains to homeowner's insurance.
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:19.420]   - And more.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:21.980]   I think that every time someone sends me an email
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:24.060]   on how much they saved after listening to that episode,
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:24.900]   I write it down.
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.340]   My stack rank is currently at $14,000.
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.020]   So if you listen to that episode
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:32.500]   and you save more than $14,000, absolutely reach out.
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.980]   I want to put you at the top of the leaderboard.
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:37.260]   Our goal is to save people as much as possible.
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:38.340]   That's part of the theme of the show.
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.860]   But one of the things that I think is really important
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.460]   is when we bought this home,
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:45.540]   the amount that we could insure the home for
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.900]   was not what I thought was an appropriate amount.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.060]   So there are multiple people that have a requirement.
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:51.660]   The lender is going to have some requirement
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:52.980]   that you insure the home enough.
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:54.340]   The insurance company will.
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.180]   But at the end of the day,
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:57.060]   that insurance is there to make sure
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.500]   that you can rebuild that home if something happens.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.900]   And I asked around from some real estate agents I knew
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:05.300]   how much it would cost to buy a teardown and build a house.
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:06.620]   And I asked a builder.
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:09.740]   And the numbers they gave me were about 20% more
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:13.260]   than the cost estimator that the insurance company gave me.
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:16.660]   And they were more than what our lender wanted us
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.600]   to have the home insured for.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.080]   So for me, I didn't want to deal with that risk.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.680]   So I actually just increased the coverage on the home.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.260]   So my home is insured for more than the minimum
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:27.620]   that they required.
[01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.560]   And one way to increase that total number
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.860]   that's cheaper than just insuring it for more
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:34.880]   is looking for extended reconstruction
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.040]   as an add-on to your policy.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.580]   So that will cover you for anywhere from 25 to 100%
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:42.960]   of the cost of your home.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.620]   So if you have a home that's worth 500 grand
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.900]   and you insure it for 500 grand,
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:49.900]   but you add 50% extended reconstruction,
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:53.220]   up to 750 to repair it if building materials go up
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.700]   or something changes in the time,
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.660]   you'll get a little bit of extra coverage there.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.620]   So I think that's something really important
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:01.080]   to think about as you go through that.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:01.920]   - Yeah, that's really cool.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.460]   I never thought about that.
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:06.220]   - Insurance, I'll just say this little line here
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.860]   because we don't have time to get into it.
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:10.460]   It's becoming increasingly difficult to get
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.660]   and significantly more expensive.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:14.700]   I'm literally starting an insurance company right now
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:17.320]   because it has been so hard to find this.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.340]   And I didn't realize until I just bought a lot of real estate
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.100]   how bad it's getting in certain states.
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.260]   There are certain areas where you're looking at homes
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:26.020]   that you will literally not be able to get insurance
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.500]   if you plan on making it a short-term rental.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.460]   Florida is notorious for this.
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.020]   I had a quote on a property I bought in Florida
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:37.220]   that was $26,000 a year for an insurance policy.
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:40.380]   I mean, that is a mortgage payment on a normal home
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.260]   and some California problems as well.
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.700]   So in your due diligence process,
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.860]   we used to treat insurance like just an afterthought,
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:48.220]   like, oh yeah, yeah, my loan officer
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:49.100]   will connect me with someone.
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.660]   I'll look at policies, I'll pick one.
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:53.100]   No, you gotta make sure before you close on that house
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.500]   that you can get insurance
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.900]   and that it will be insured for as much as you will need
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:57.780]   if something goes wrong.
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.180]   Great point there, Chris.
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.020]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.180]   Tahoe is another area like that
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:03.060]   where I know people who have very, very high costs.
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.480]   And even in the Bay Area, because of the fires,
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.280]   there are a bunch of insurance carriers
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.580]   that just won't insure.
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.380]   Travelers told me, "We can't insure your home."
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.660]   We're like, we're not even in a real wildfire area,
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:13.740]   but we're off their list.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.560]   - Yeah, there's a BRRRR project that we're working on
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.580]   that we're gonna do a show on in the future.
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:18.900]   We did one previously.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.380]   I could not get insurance for fire.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.820]   I had to go through the state.
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:25.100]   The state had to create its own insurance program
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:29.060]   because providers were not providing it to people.
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:31.100]   And no, you can't get a loan in most cases
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.860]   if you don't have fire insurance on a property.
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.720]   So people don't talk about it very often,
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.660]   but it's a pretty significant problem that's going around.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.880]   I'm glad you brought it up.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.460]   - Yeah, I'll give a couple quick ones
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:40.860]   and then obviously check out this episode
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.740]   if you wanna go deep and save money on insurance.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:45.880]   Bundling, not always the best deal.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.720]   So a lot of people think,
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.020]   "Oh, I'm just gonna get my home insurance
[01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:50.020]   with the same company that does my auto insurance."
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:54.580]   We found that many carriers, that was not the case.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:57.060]   And we probably looked at 15, 20 carriers.
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:59.820]   So don't just assume that that's the right thing.
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:01.780]   Also, don't just assume that your carrier
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:03.140]   that you've had for five years,
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.500]   because they have their,
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.420]   you've been a customer forever discount,
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:07.700]   is actually cheaper.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:11.480]   I found that to definitely not be the case in our situation.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.520]   Also, don't forget that now you own a home,
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.260]   there's a chance that that home has,
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:19.260]   either now or in the future, increased your net worth enough
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:22.740]   that it might be worth looking at a umbrella policy
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.160]   that goes beyond the value of the home
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.540]   or your homeowner's insurance.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.860]   And that will also extend to your auto insurance.
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.660]   So I think there are a lot of people out there
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.100]   that buy a home, it appreciates over time,
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.060]   their net worth grows and grows and grows,
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.180]   and they're driving around
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:38.140]   and they haven't updated their auto policy
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:40.960]   and they have $100,000 of liability insurance.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.580]   So get in a car accident,
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:45.040]   something happens terrible
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.700]   and someone sues you for more than that.
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.540]   Well, it turns out that you have more assets
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.420]   and if you don't have an umbrella policy
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:53.460]   to sit on top of your auto policy or your home policy,
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:55.620]   you could find yourself in a not great situation.
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:56.900]   And there are some states
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.780]   where you're even able to sue someone
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:12:59.900]   for their future earnings.
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:03.340]   So you really wanna make sure that as you kind of,
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:04.260]   we're talking about real estate,
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.500]   we're talking about building wealth,
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.340]   as you cross that threshold to,
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.140]   now I'm starting to build my wealth,
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:11.380]   I think it's equally as important to protect that wealth.
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:15.780]   And so that's something that it's very inexpensive.
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:19.520]   We're talking $100, depending on how much you need
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:23.460]   to protect yourself up to like a million dollars a year.
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.380]   I think it's something people should be considerate.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.720]   And then last, you buy this home, wait till you move in.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.140]   After you've moved in,
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.800]   go around the house with a camera or your phone
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.560]   and just take a video of everything in the room
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.720]   and just document all the stuff you own.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:40.280]   Because it's gonna save you a ridiculous amount of time
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:43.040]   if anything were to happen, burn down, burglary,
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.820]   you probably didn't save the receipts
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:45.900]   for everything you own.
[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.340]   So take five minutes,
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:50.840]   make your own MTV crib style video running around,
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.800]   sharing everything in your house just in case,
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:53.720]   so you have that on hand.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.360]   I think that's pretty important as well.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.040]   - I've had to go through that process before
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.560]   and I did not do that.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.400]   Gosh, it was horrible.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.480]   It was horrible.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.320]   And you gotta show receipts and you gotta show photos
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.420]   and you gotta look through thousands of photos
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:09.040]   on your camera roll for like,
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.900]   so trying to find that family picture you took
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:14.040]   with the flat screen in the background.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.780]   Just walk through, make that video.
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:16.760]   I got a bunch of other tips,
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.960]   but we've been doing a lot in this episode.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.000]   And I think anyone who's looking to buy a home
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.200]   is absolutely going to be able to get a better deal,
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.360]   find a better home, find the right home
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.520]   and get through that process easier.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.880]   This has been so helpful.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.560]   I'm so glad we got to do this episode.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.040]   I feel like there's more things we could break down,
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.160]   but at this point, I feel like this is a good stopping point.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.200]   Is there any last bits of wisdom
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.800]   that you guys wanna share to anyone
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.560]   thinking about going through this process?
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.700]   - Yeah, there's a thing that I mentioned
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:43.540]   to a lot of people who say,
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:45.000]   "I don't wanna be a real estate investor,"
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.220]   or "Renting is cheaper than owning."
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.240]   It often is.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.720]   In most cases, if you buy a home,
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.840]   the mortgage is gonna be more than the rent in year one.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.880]   But go back to what rents were five years ago,
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.080]   10 years ago.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.800]   Are you telling me that the mortgages from 10 years ago
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.800]   are more expensive than rents today?
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.200]   It's hardly ever the case.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.200]   So when you take the longer term approach,
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.640]   even if you're not a real estate investor
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.520]   looking to rent out a property,
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.520]   buying a home and locking in a mortgage,
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.280]   especially with all the inflation we have,
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:14.120]   will always be cheaper for you in the long run.
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.120]   If you look at what your parents are paying on the house
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.380]   that they bought 25 years ago,
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.520]   those payments are laughable,
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.480]   but at the time they bought it,
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.560]   they thought it was expensive.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.600]   So I often tell people,
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:24.100]   even if they don't wanna be
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.160]   a quote-unquote real estate investor,
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.320]   you should still buy a house
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.320]   and make sure that you've taken control
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.280]   of your financial future.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.840]   You're not in the hands of landlords
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.200]   that can raise rent every year.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.800]   My only caveat there would be,
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.360]   given the fees that you pay to an agent
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.560]   when you're selling the house
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.140]   and to the buyer's agent as well,
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:43.980]   if you're gonna buy a home
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:45.320]   and you're gonna be there for a year or two,
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.380]   you might not make money
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:48.200]   if you plan on selling it in a year or two,
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.160]   given the fees that are associated with that process.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.940]   However, my advice,
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.360]   and this will lead us to an episode on both of our shows
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.200]   about house hacking is,
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.800]   there are ways if you think,
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:02.100]   gosh, I can only really afford a two-bedroom house,
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:03.240]   but we're about to start a family
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.040]   and we're gonna need a bigger house in a few years,
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.280]   what do I do?
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.120]   There are ways to buy the four-bedroom house
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.840]   or the duplex that you might one day need
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:12.400]   for your whole family or something like that now,
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.840]   use tactics that you guys have talked about,
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.320]   we've talked about in multiple episodes
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.040]   that we'll link in the show notes on house hacking,
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.320]   to be able to get that house
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.120]   that two, three, four, five years from now
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:24.080]   is the house you want and get it earlier,
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.560]   increase some cashflow from it
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.680]   so you can afford it for those next three or four years
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.600]   while it's more space than you need.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.280]   And I think that ends up allowing you
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.120]   to buy your 10, 15, 20, 30-year home
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.160]   before you're ready for all that space
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.480]   and not be in a situation
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.400]   where you either can't buy the home
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.400]   or you've got to buy a home and sell it in a few years.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.240]   So we've both done episodes on it,
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.040]   there's a number of tactics there.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:48.420]   I think you can even use that income from your house hack
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:51.640]   to end up qualifying for income on your DTI
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.120]   for rent for your mortgage.
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:55.860]   So I think there's some really great stuff there.
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:57.480]   Obviously, we've both done episodes on it,
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.360]   but there's a lot of stuff there.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.560]   We did that in San Francisco
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.320]   and that helped us buy a three-bedroom place
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.080]   when we really only needed a one-bedroom.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.960]   - Yeah, house hacking is,
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.800]   I will always thank house hacking for giving me my start.
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.600]   It is the catalyst for all wealth and real estate,
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:11.760]   my deep, deep belief.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.320]   So yes, go listen to both those episodes.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.040]   If you were closed off to the idea,
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.900]   I promise after you listen to them,
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.160]   you're gonna be all in.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.160]   - Awesome, this has been fantastic.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:22.480]   I guess thank you for being here,
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:23.680]   thank you for having me here,
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.100]   thanks for doing this kind of fun episode,
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.520]   and I hope we get to have a conversation
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.640]   like this again soon.
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:29.460]   - Same. - Yeah, Chris,

[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.080]   how to make money through real estate.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.720]   And Chris, I will say, I have a book coming out
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:57.020]   through BiggerPockets Publishing in October
[01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:58.760]   that's gonna be called "Pillars of Wealth,"
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:01.300]   and it's all about saving money, making money,
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:02.320]   and investing the difference.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.080]   And so much of what you've talked about,
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.080]   I echo the sentiments in that book.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.440]   It is incredibly important to be a wise steward
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.680]   of your resources if there's ways you can save money
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:12.560]   through credit card hacking, travel hacking,
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.680]   food hacking, everything.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.080]   Take advantage of that.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.100]   The people who manage their money well
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.840]   tend to be rewarded by the money gods who bring more.
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.960]   So I love what you're doing, thank you for doing it,
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.920]   and I'm glad our audience got to hear about it.
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.020]   - Yeah, I'm glad I'm here.
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.720]   And I like what you're talking about
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.160]   because building wealth is not always
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.080]   about sacrificing everything.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.960]   And so I think my goal is to help people live a life
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.960]   they really wanna live, just live it for less.
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.920]   - Yeah, that's awesome, exactly.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.560]   - Yeah, and on that note, there's an episode
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:42.200]   I think everyone listening on the BiggerPockets side
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.020]   should check out.
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.920]   I did this episode with Bill Perkins
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.680]   who wrote a book called "Die With Zero."
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:50.560]   And it's radically reframed my perspective
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.800]   on basically all things wealth,
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:53.800]   spending money and everything.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.600]   It really wanted to focus on what's important,
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.320]   maximizing my net fulfillment,
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.960]   not necessarily my net worth.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.520]   And so if I leave people with...
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.160]   Obviously, if you wanna optimize your insurance
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.200]   and save money, go there.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.720]   You wanna travel for free, where's episodes there.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.280]   But if you wanna just kind of like
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:12.440]   really kick your entire perspective on money around
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.360]   and think about whether there's maybe a new way
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:17.200]   you might wanna be thinking about how you spend and save,
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.480]   episode 91 with Bill Perkins literally changed my life.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.560]   It's the only episode I've done
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.560]   where I think I've listened to it five or six times.
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.600]   - Nice, okay.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.300]   Yeah, I'm gonna go listen to that.
