[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   but we're just trying to make sure
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   that we're not mouth breathing.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.520]   That's one of our biggest concerns with sleep.
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.240]   And so that can often spill over
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.600]   into rates of sleep apnea, upper airway resistance syndrome,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.120]   which is much more prevalent than most people realize.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.200]   So sleeping on your back can often
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.840]   be a big flare up for that.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.880]   So our often recommendation for sleep
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.960]   is a side sleeping element,
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.920]   'cause we do see that when we're sleeping on our stomach,
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.640]   then that can sometimes mess with
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.960]   some of both our breathing and then of course,
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.880]   comfort and some of the other issues
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.160]   that might come up from spine positional piece.
