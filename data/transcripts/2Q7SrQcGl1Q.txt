[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.720]   - One young man writes in to ask this,
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.080]   "Pastor John, what do you do in a local church
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.080]   "when the people affirm your leadership,
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.940]   "but the leadership in your church doesn't?"
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.880]   - Yeah, that's a question that comes to me
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.880]   often from youth ministers or assistant pastors
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.120]   who love the Bible and are trying to teach it faithfully.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.720]   The kids and their parents are often eating it up,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.520]   or the small groups are,
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.640]   and the senior pastor's a little bit wary
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.520]   or something like that.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.200]   So that's the kind of situation I'm thinking
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.760]   when you ask that question, that's what I've heard.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.320]   So whom you listen to in your ministry is really important.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.200]   Do you listen to the people who are loving your work,
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.520]   or do you listen to your senior leadership?
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.880]   If you're not the senior, do you listen to others,
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.800]   like colleagues outside of your church?
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.960]   Do you listen to your spouse, your friends?
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.680]   Who do you listen to?
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.040]   And here's my take.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.720]   First, take your cues from the scriptures.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.340]   Listen to God.
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.240]   Whatever any man says,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.400]   it cannot compare with what God says.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.440]   Your conscience must be clear before God
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.840]   that you are teaching and ministering faithfully.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.960]   Paul said, and it's so sweet, Romans 14, 22,
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.520]   "Blessed is the one who has no reason
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.040]   "to pass judgment on himself for what he approves."
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.280]   Wow, that's so true.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.440]   A clear conscience is a powerful thing.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.160]   You must be true to your own discernment
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.440]   of what God says in his word.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.360]   And of course, you know you're fallible.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.960]   You know you should be always open to counsel,
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.080]   that you may be reading the Bible wrongly,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.840]   but in the end, you gotta have peace
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.600]   that you're one with God's word.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.260]   That's the first thing, listen to God.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.600]   The second thing is listen long and hard
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.120]   to your seniors and your overseers,
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.680]   even the ones who disagree with you,
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.800]   or are critical of you,
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.840]   or not happy with what you're doing.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.200]   They may seem to be disapproving of what's going on,
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.320]   but listen, don't write them off too quickly.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.200]   Test all things, hold fast to what is good.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.840]   I think a mark of a mature, young pastor,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.160]   that is a pastor who's maturing quickly,
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.920]   is his humility and his willingness to be rebuked,
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.240]   his willingness to be questioned.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.960]   He may not agree with everything,
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   but he's not defensive in a knee-jerk kind of way.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.600]   But you know that they're fallible too,
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.320]   and so in the end, it's gonna be the word of God,
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.840]   and a wider constituency that are gonna make
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840]   the final difference here.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.160]   The third thing is listen to trusted spiritual counselors.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.240]   Not just yes men, don't surround yourself
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.680]   with just people who think that you're
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.040]   the best thing after whole bread,
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.000]   but the most spiritual people you know,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.240]   the people who love the word of God,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.920]   who are deeply prayerful and worshipful,
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.120]   the people who are bold in their witness
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.480]   and risk-taking in their service of Christ,
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.800]   listen to them, the people who obey Jesus,
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   whatever the cost, they're the ones
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   who will tell you like it is,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.120]   and take them seriously, seek them out,
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.880]   tell them the situation, let them know what's going on,
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.480]   and listen to their heart.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.200]   And then the fourth thing, listen to those
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.280]   who have walked through similar circumstances.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.080]   If you know people who are 20 years ahead of you
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.280]   in ministry, the same thing happened to them,
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.720]   ask them what they learned from it, and grow from that.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.840]   And then pray earnestly that Christ
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.040]   would illumine all of this listening,
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.040]   'cause it can be very confusing.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.760]   If your leaders will entrust you to God,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.120]   if your leaders will allow you to teach and lead
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   according to what you see in the word,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.240]   you may have a fruitful ministry right there
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.520]   in that setting, even if there's not complete agreement.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.800]   But if your leaders want you to cease
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.140]   from teaching significant things
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.360]   that you see as true and necessary,
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.960]   cease from patterns of ministry that you think are biblical,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.420]   then you'll probably need to look
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.040]   for another place of service,
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.520]   and I would just plead with God,
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.280]   open a door so that there would be
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.320]   a confirming call to something,
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.840]   not just away from something.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.960]   - Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you

[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.720]   which says, "God heals all of our diseases."
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.960]   So how literally do we take that promise?
