[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   At Weights & Biases, we make developer tools for deep learning.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.700]   We want to make it easier to track your experiments, improve your models, and share your findings.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.340]   Add just a few lines to your training script to get started, no matter what framework or infrastructure you're using.
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.260]   You'll see the loss and accuracy of your models in real time,
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.460]   and we'll try to make it easy to reproduce this run by saving your hyperparameters, performance metrics, terminal log, output file, and git state.
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.400]   You can log anything else you care about, from custom metrics to images, matplotlib charts, histograms, and arbitrary HTML.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.660]   You can see your experiments and results in one place.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.200]   Our tables let you filter, sort, and group your runs to see what's happening in your training.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.100]   High-dimensional data is hard to understand, so we've built some visualizations to help.
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.160]   We handle massive, distributed training to scale up to millions of runs.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.760]   You can write reports to document your work, collaborate with others, share your results, and see the progress of your whole team.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.400]   Our software is always free for students and academics, and a company license is cheap compared to the headache and cost of redoing your research.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.000]   Sign up at wnb.com to get started.
