[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620]   Here are a few strategies to potentially pair
[00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.120]   with keeping less cash for your safety net
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.000]   or your short-term goals.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   So one is 0% APR credit cards.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.560]   Some credit cards offer 12 to 18 months
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.100]   of no interest on purchases,
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.920]   sometimes on balance transfers.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.720]   Usually you're gonna make a minimum payment,
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.340]   but you're not gonna have to make the full payment.
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.100]   And so this could be a great backup emergency buffer
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.440]   for circumstances where you all of a sudden need some cash
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.900]   and you don't wanna have to sell your investment accounts.
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.440]   You could take advantage of 0% APR credit cards.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.540]   Now, there's no guarantee that they will be around
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.480]   when you need them.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.420]   There's no guarantee you will get approved for them.
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.000]   And so obviously these strategies are advanced
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.220]   because they come with some risk,
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.620]   but it is something that I know people have been able
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.560]   to take advantage of in those circumstances
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.640]   where they wanted to avoid selling
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.400]   from their taxable brokerage account.
