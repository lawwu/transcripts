[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Verses 11, 12, and 13 in the tenth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.200]   For the scripture says, "Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed, for there is
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.480]   no difference between the Jew and the Greek.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.000]   For the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.560]   For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.120]   Now we are considering this little subsection, this little paragraph.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.560]   I say little because it's little in number of verses, but certainly not little in content
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.600]   as we are beginning to see.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.120]   The apostle here is proving, as is his custom and method, the proposition that he's been
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.640]   laying down, that salvation is a matter of faith and of belief, that what saves a man
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.000]   is that he shall confess with the mouth the law of Jesus and believe in his heart that
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.160]   God hath raised him from the dead.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.760]   And now here he proves this by quoting from the 28th chapter of the prophet Isaiah and
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.760]   the 16th verse.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.000]   The scripture says, "Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.480]   And there we saw that he got three points.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.120]   That it is believing that matters, and that if a man does believe he shall never be ashamed,
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.320]   never be put ashamed.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.280]   And that therefore as it is thus a matter of believing in him who can never fail us,
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.920]   it is obviously a salvation that can be preached to and to offer to whosoever.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.840]   That to be preached to all and whosoever does believe in him shall never be put to shame.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.320]   And then having said that, having quoted this scripture in order to prove it, the apostle
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.800]   now in the 12th verse comes to make his comment on the quotation from Isaiah 28, 16.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.520]   And his comment is, "For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek."
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.680]   There's his fundamental proposition.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.640]   This is the crucial point, of course.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.400]   That's where the Jews had gone astray, and they were quite wrong and they were quite
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   inexcusable.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.920]   They were wrong, but as I say they were inexcusable because their own prophets, in whom they boasted
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.000]   so much, had established this very point themselves.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.040]   They were altogether wrong, therefore.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.400]   Wrong in not believing the gospel as the only way of salvation, and wrong in resenting the
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.440]   fact that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles, and that the Gentiles were being
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.640]   received into the Christian church.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.960]   Now then, the apostle here gives us the reasons for saying that they are wrong, or the reasons
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.280]   for saying that there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.840]   The first reason is the one we dealt with just at the end last Friday night.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.880]   He said the same Lord is over all.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.760]   There is only one Lord, and he is the Lord of the entire universe.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.360]   Now the Jews had gone astray there.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.440]   They had worked themselves into the position of thinking that God was only the God of the
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.600]   Jews, that he had nothing to do with the rest of the world.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.280]   And as we pointed out, the apostle already in the third chapter had dealt with that by
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.360]   putting it in the form of a question.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.720]   He had put out this question in verse 29 of the third chapter, "Is he the God of the
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   Jews only?
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.080]   Is he not also of the Gentiles?"
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.240]   And had answered the questions by saying, "Yes, of the Gentiles also."
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.680]   God is the God of the Gentiles as much as he is the God of the Jews.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.840]   He had done certain special things to and through the Jews, and had shown them special
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.840]   favors.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.480]   But that did not mean that he had finished with the rest of the world.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.000]   Far from it.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.680]   He is the God of the Gentiles as well as the God of the Jews.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.260]   And it's a tremendous argument as we saw.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.960]   And you remember how Paul in preaching in Athens, as you have it in the account in Acts
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.440]   17, had made use of this very selfsame argument.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.000]   Now commendeth all men everywhere to repent.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.480]   And he puts that in terms of the fact that God is the creator and the sustainer of the
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.680]   whole universe and of all men.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.680]   There is only one Lord, and he is Lord of all, so that all are confronted by the same
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.160]   situation, their relationship to this one and only Lord.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.640]   But now we move to the second argument which he implies.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:54.100]   And this is the one to which I was referring particularly when I said last Friday night
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.760]   that the apostle always, when he does make a comment, never just merely makes a comment.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.480]   He always adds to what he's been saying.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.640]   So that in this twelfth verse he's not merely putting in his own language what he's been
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.720]   quoting from the scripture in verse 11.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.040]   He brings out another aspect of it.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.520]   And it's all to be found here in one word, and it is the word "rich."
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.520]   Rich.
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:24.700]   The same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.700]   Here is the second great argument.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:35.300]   The argument that is based upon the riches of God's grace.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.620]   That's why he introduces the word here.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.140]   It's a very, very powerful argument.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.420]   God is the God and the Lord of the whole world.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.780]   That's one argument, but this is equally an argument.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.500]   That he has such riches of grace that he's able to give it to all.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:01.580]   All stand in need of it, and he is able, as regards his riches, to deal with all, Gentiles
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.980]   as well as Jews.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.940]   Now the argument you see is roughly like this.
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.900]   Salvation depends entirely upon God and his power to give, his ability to give.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.320]   That's what it depends upon.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.780]   It doesn't depend upon anything in us at all.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.100]   That was Paul's way of bringing down the Jew and raising the Gentile.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.020]   There's no difference between the Jew and the Gentile, the Jew and the Greek, because
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.580]   all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.420]   All are equally hopeless, lying on the ground.
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.580]   There's no point in having any comparisons when you're all licking the dust.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.660]   And that's the position of the whole of mankind.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.060]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.440]   So therefore all these comparisons and contrasts are not only wrong, but they're a sure waste
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.440]   of time.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.960]   Yes, but look at it from the other angle.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.240]   It is God's power that saves anybody.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.600]   And therefore as it's entirely his power and what's in him and what he has put into the
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.320]   Lord Jesus Christ, there is obviously hope for anybody.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.400]   So again, the distinction between the Jew and the Gentile is entirely demolished.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.120]   Now this is the great theme of course of the New Testament.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.720]   And it is in particular the great theme of the epistles of the New Testament, and particularly
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:26.600]   the theme of this great man who went under the name of the apostle to the Gentiles, and
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.560]   who gloried in that office which had been given him.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.680]   And it is in particular the great theme of this particular epistle to the Revels.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.920]   So you see, the apostle announced it at the very beginning.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.120]   Watch his architecture, if you like.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.040]   Watch his structure.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.960]   He announces it all at the very beginning in the 16th verse of the first chapter.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.480]   I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.480]   Why not?
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:01.160]   Well, it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first,
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.920]   but also to the Greek.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.520]   He had already said in a little bit of personal introduction before that, he says, "I long
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.760]   to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end, that ye may be
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.680]   established, that is, that I may be comforted with you, together with you, by the mutual
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.040]   faith, both of you and me.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.280]   Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you,
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.400]   but was hindered hitherto, that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.400]   Gentiles."
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:34.880]   So, the money and debtor, both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.600]   to the unwise, is a debtor to all men.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   Why?
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:44.080]   Well, for this reason, that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.000]   that believeth, the Jew first, also to the Greek.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.040]   It is the great central theme of this mighty epistle.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:58.040]   And as I have reminded you before, you get it again in the 24th verse of the third chapter,
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.320]   being justified freely by his grace.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:09.160]   Notice the freely, being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.160]   in Christ Jesus.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.240]   Well now, that's the great theme.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.800]   And here again he comes back to it.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:21.080]   The same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.800]   This was the thing that staggered the apostle.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.720]   This was the thing in which he gloried, the riches of his grace.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.180]   It's enough for the whole world.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.520]   This was the thing in which he boasted and in which he rejoiced.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.120]   Very well.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:49.320]   Because salvation is in the Lord Jesus Christ, and because he is who and what he is, it is
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.160]   a salvation for the Jew and the Gentile.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.360]   There is no limit in the way in which the Jews were imposing their limitations.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:05.160]   Now, I want to take this up with you, because it is such a glorious theme.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.560]   It's very germane to the apostle's argument here, and it's a very powerful argument, but
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:15.920]   over and above the argument, the thing itself is so glorious that we must pause and look
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.920]   at it.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.000]   What is this one word, rich?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.720]   And we are meant to examine it and to work out its content.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.760]   Now, what is the New Testament evidence for this term, rich?
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.720]   What is the basis on which the apostle is able to say this?
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.520]   Well, you get it, of course, even in the four Gospels.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:48.640]   I say even the four Gospels for this reason, that our Lord's earthly ministry was in the
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.640]   main and almost exclusively given to the Jews.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:11:00.160]   Now, there are some very interesting statements with regard to this, in which our Lord throws
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.960]   out hints, as it were, of what is going to happen later.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.000]   One of them is a very beautiful story.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.520]   It's the story of the so-called Syrophoenician woman.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:22.640]   You remember that story of how this woman came and told him about her trouble and about
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:30.560]   her predicament, and how our Lord, as it were, played with her for a while.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:36.800]   But his object was, of course, to show the real character of the truth.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:44.440]   Our Lord is approached by this woman who asks for his help.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.840]   And our Lord doesn't immediately promise it, but as I say, he plays with her in this way.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.360]   Let me read the account to you in the seventh chapter of the Gospel according to St. Mark.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.920]   You've got it in the others also.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.760]   A certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, and reading at verse 25,
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.600]   heard of him and came and fell at his feet.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.560]   The woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by nation.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.880]   And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.960]   But Jesus said unto her, "Let the children first be filled, for it is not me to take
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.680]   the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs."
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.520]   See, that classification of Jews, Gentiles, they're dogs.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.520]   He uses that expression.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.880]   She answered and said unto him, "Yes, Lord, yet the dogs," which means the little dogs,
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.560]   the puppies, "under the table eat of the children's crumbs."
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:43.080]   And he said unto her for this saying, "Go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter."
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.720]   And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   upon the bed.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.680]   Now, what our Lord is really saying there is this.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:59.000]   Primarily while I'm here, I am preaching to and ministering to the Jews.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.880]   But this woman seems to have got an insight, and he blesses her as it were.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.880]   He grants her a request, and the daughter is healed, in order to show that ultimately
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:17.480]   he has come not for the Jews only, but also for the Gentiles.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.760]   You get the same thing in reality in his dealings with the woman of Samaria, as it's recorded
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.640]   in the fourth chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.600]   I don't stay with that, because I want to take you to the twelfth chapter of John's
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.160]   Gospel, where the thing is put before us much more explicitly.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:38.040]   You remember that we are told that at a certain point in his ministry, certain Greeks came
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.760]   to worship at the feast.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.720]   The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him saying,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.600]   "Sir, we would see Jesus."
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:53.680]   Philip cometh and telleth Andrew, and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.520]   And then our Lord proceeded to speak.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.200]   He refused to see the Greeks.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:09.160]   But in connection with that refusal, he said this, "Now is the judgment of this world.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.720]   Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:20.200]   And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me."
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.960]   Now that's Israel's answer to the Greeks.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.020]   All men doesn't mean every single individual in the whole world.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:30.720]   It means not only Jews, but also Gentiles.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.040]   All men means here men from any nation whatsoever.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.800]   He doesn't see the Greeks now, but if I be lifted up after I've been crucified, after
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:45.200]   my work is finished, then I will draw all men unto me.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.020]   This he said signifying what death he should die.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:54.840]   But it's a most important and the most crucial statement, where he's really saying this,
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.200]   that as long as he's but a human teacher here in this world, his ministry is to the
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:07.920]   Jews, but as the Savior, he is the Savior of Greeks as well as Jews, Gentiles as well
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.920]   as Jews.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.560]   Now that's a most crucial and important statement.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.760]   Then when you come to the book of the Acts of the Apostles, of course, you get all this
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.760]   being worked out.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:25.520]   You see the initial difficulty through which Peter, especially at the pass, wasn't clear
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.520]   about this.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.880]   It was very difficult for any Jew to be clear about it.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.920]   And yet from the very beginning, he seems to have some inkling of it.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.680]   Because the moment he heals the men at the beautiful gate of the temple in Acts 3, and
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:46.160]   the people came crowding together round about Peter and John, greatly wondering, Peter said,
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.880]   "Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this, or why look ye so honestly on us, as by our
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.920]   own power or holiness we have made this man to walk?
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.960]   The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.880]   Son Jesus, whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate; but ye denied
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:09.520]   the Holy One and the just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you, and killed the Prince
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.240]   of life, whom God hath raised from the dead.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:18.800]   And his name, through faith in his name, hath given this man, made this man strong, whom
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.680]   ye see and know; yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.840]   in the presence of us all."
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.840]   Now there's the beginning.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:32.040]   Then in the next chapter, Peter and John are before the court, the Sanhedrin, and Peter
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:37.080]   then puts it in a tremendous statement in the twelfth verse, "Neither is there salvation
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.360]   in any other."
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:45.440]   And then the universal statement, "For there is none other name under heaven given amongst
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.880]   men whereby we must be saved."
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.960]   It's a universal statement again.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:58.360]   He is indeed the Savior of the world, and he is the only Savior, but he is the Savior
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.360]   of the world.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.720]   "None other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved."
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:10.360]   And of course, when you come to the epistles, all this is worked out still more fully.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.480]   You've got it in this epistle to the Romans.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.360]   We have been working it out in depth, so I don't stop with that now.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.680]   But it's equally clear in the epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:26.880]   Here, you see, he's writing particularly to Greeks, and he says, "We preach Christ
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.880]   crucified."
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   Well, why?
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:35.760]   Well, because Christ crucified is the power of God, and he is the wisdom of God.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:42.960]   This is God's way of dealing with mankind, Greeks as well as Jews.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.440]   And he brings out this element of his sufficiency and his fullness.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.920]   Here it is in the third chapter of that first epistle.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:56.120]   He says, "Therefore let no man glory in men, for all things are yours, whether Paul
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:01.280]   or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come,
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.080]   all are yours, and he is Christ's, and Christ is God's."
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.840]   That's the Gentiles.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   And shows again, you see, that it's all in this one great and glorious person.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:21.920]   And still more strikingly, does he bring out this whole aspect of the truth in the epistle
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.480]   to the Ephesians.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:30.080]   Where, you see, he speaks again on a world scale.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:35.160]   He says that God showed his power in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.560]   at his own right hand in heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.560]   and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that which
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   is to come.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.840]   And hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.600]   the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.680]   And you see, he's already said in the tenth verse that this is God's purpose, that in
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:07.760]   the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:14.040]   in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are in earth, even in him.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.880]   Everybody, the whole cosmos is included.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:24.120]   And then you see, he particularizes, in whom also we, that's Jews, have obtained an inheritance,
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.800]   being predestinated according to the purpose of him, that we should be to the praise of
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.200]   his glory who first trusted in Christ.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:37.040]   Then in verse 13, in whom you also trusted, you Gentiles, we Jews came in first, you come
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.040]   in.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:43.720]   Our Lord said you shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, Samaria, the uttermost parts
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   of the earth.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   That's the order.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:53.520]   And here, this is the great theme of Ephesians, how the Gentiles have come in as well as the
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.560]   Jews.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.080]   And he's very concerned about this argument.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:02.320]   The second chapter of Ephesians is a great outworking of all this.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.440]   Listen, wherefore remember that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh who were
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.120]   called down to circumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.000]   by ends, that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.480]   of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:25.680]   in the world, but now in Christ Jesus, you who sometimes were far off are made nigh by
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.240]   the blood of Christ.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.720]   This is this tremendous thing, he says, that has happened.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.580]   And then, as you've noticed in the reading at the beginning in chapter 3, he gives us
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.120]   a great exposition of this.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:44.600]   And what he says is this, he says, you know, this had not really been realized until now,
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.120]   whereby when he read, he may understand my knowledge of the mystery of Christ.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.840]   This mystery, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.920]   revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:02.680]   Now he doesn't mean by that, that this wasn't known at all, because, he quotes, many passages
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.000]   from the prophets in which this had been foretold.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.280]   The prophets had had a glimpse of it, but the Jews had not understood it.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.040]   It wasn't plain and clear to them.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.560]   As I say, it wasn't even clear to Peter after Pentecost.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:20.680]   And it took a vision to convince Peter that he must go to the house of Cornelius and open
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.720]   the door to the Gentiles to come in.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.720]   It needed a vision.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.580]   It was there, but they couldn't see it.
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:32.640]   It hadn't been revealed as it has now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:38.660]   that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.340]   in Christ by the gospel.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.320]   And on he goes to elaborate it.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.320]   So you see, it's a very crucial part of the argument of the first three chapters of the
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.000]   epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.120]   But then, if anything, and if it's possible, he takes it even to a higher height in the
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.360]   first two chapters of the epistle to the Colossians.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.880]   And that is the great point that he makes there.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:12.520]   You see, the early church was being troubled by these Judaizers, by these Jews who either
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:17.000]   said that salvation was only for the Jews or that even a Gentile who's believed the
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.520]   gospel has got to be circumcised and more or less become a Jew before he can be a complete
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.520]   Christian.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.960]   The apostle denounces all this.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:31.280]   And this heresy was beginning to trouble the Colossian churches together with certain other
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.280]   heresies.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.360]   And what the apostle sets out to prove is this.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.080]   He says all this is wrong.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:44.560]   It is all in this one person, the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we have redemption through
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.120]   his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:53.280]   Verse 14 of chapter 1, "Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.280]   creature?
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:59.280]   For by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.280]   invisible."
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.600]   This has been sometimes called a description of the cosmic Christ.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.800]   And he is the cosmic Christ.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:12.240]   All things are going to be reconciled in him by God, whether they be thrones or dominions
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.920]   or principalities or powers.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.340]   All things were created by him and for him.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.840]   And he is before all things and by him all things consist.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.920]   He is the head of the body which is the church and so on.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:30.160]   For it pleased the Father that in him all fullness dwell.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.640]   Now you get the same thing worked out in the second chapter.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.400]   He says, "Be well lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.720]   tradition of men and the rudiments of the world and not after Christ.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:47.480]   For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:54.420]   All this is just meant to prove that salvation is entirely and altogether in the Lord Jesus
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.420]   Christ.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:01.700]   And he has put it like this, you see, in the third verse, "In him are hid all the treasures
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.180]   of wisdom and knowledge."
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:10.420]   The same Lord over all is rich unto all.
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.100]   Same idea precisely.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:19.500]   All the treasures of God's wisdom and knowledge are in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.820]   So he says, "I say this lest any man should beguile you with enticing words."
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:29.940]   You've got to realize that it's all there and it's all in him and it's all absolutely
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.380]   perfect and so the one thing that matters is your relationship to him.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.380]   Very well.
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.660]   Now there is the essence of the argument.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.940]   There are other passages that we could quote.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.020]   I've picked out the great and the crucial passages.
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:49.980]   No, I'm more concerned still to draw the conclusions that are to be drawn from all
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.980]   this.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:51.980]   What are they?
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.540]   Well, you see, this is what he's saying, "The same Lord over all, the one who is the
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:05.140]   Lord of the whole cosmos, is rich unto all that call upon him."
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:14.020]   What he means by that is this, that he is all-sufficient, that he is indeed everything
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.020]   that we need.
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.740]   Let me put it in this form.
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:24.860]   He needs no help, he needs no assistance, he doesn't need to be supplemented.
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:29.580]   That was the meaning of what Peter said in Acts 4.12, "There is none other name unto
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.820]   him given amongst men whereby we must be saved."
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.100]   Somebody translated that like this, "There is no second name."
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.980]   You don't say Jesus Christ and company limited.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.380]   You say Jesus Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.220]   There's no "and," there's no company, there's no addition.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:50.540]   You add anything to him, you've destroyed it all.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.540]   There's nothing.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.540]   He is everything.
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:59.140]   There is no second name given unto him amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:04.740]   And as I was saying, it is in particular the great argument of the first two chapters of
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.700]   Paul's epistle to the Colossians.
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.420]   You remember that Colossian heresy?
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.580]   It was a mixture.
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.220]   These false teachers have gone, they were preaching another gospel.
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:23.180]   Because Paul refers in the first chapter in verse 5 to the word of the true gospel.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.420]   It's translated here, "the word of the truth of the gospel."
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.820]   It really means the word of the true gospel, in contradistinction to the false gospel.
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:36.340]   And the false gospel was a queer, amalgam and mixture, like most cults and heresies
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.140]   are, a jumble of many false teachings.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.860]   There was a bit of Judaism, as I say, that you had to go back into the law, and then
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:49.940]   the observation of days and times and seasons, which he deals with at the end of the 20th
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:54.740]   chapter, at the end of the second chapter, in verses 20 and so on.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:59.780]   You touch not, taste not, handle not this false kind of asceticism, and that that's
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:05.300]   essential to your salvation, which has come out later in Roman Catholicism and so on.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:10.140]   And there was a good deal of astrology mixed up with it, and a lot of philosophical speculation.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:15.460]   There's a great deal of that in the modern world, but it had all started, you see, in
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.860]   the days of the apostle himself, 1900 years ago.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.220]   Now the apostle writes back, and this is really what he says.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:29.220]   This is all wrong, he says, because you're making the Lord Jesus Christ, but one of a
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.940]   number of intermediaries between man and God.
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.980]   And they said there were all sorts of intermediaries, that there were various angels.
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:43.940]   So you'll find in Paul's writings to Timothy that he talks about worshipping of angels.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:49.100]   What they said was this, you see, here's men, and there's God in that great glory,
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:55.540]   and you need a series of intermediaries between men and God, and there are various angels
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.540]   and so on.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.900]   And Jesus Christ was just the head of this hierarchy of intermediaries between men and
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:06.100]   God, and you had to go through all these steps and stages before you could arrive at God.
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:11.260]   Now Paul's refuting all that, and he says this is all wrong.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:15.020]   He says it is all in this one person.
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.020]   That's why he keeps on repeating this.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:22.500]   Chapter 119, "It pleased the Father that in him all fullness dwell."
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.860]   Well, if all fullness is in him, you don't need to add to him.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:31.380]   Here again you see in the second chapter he says, in verse 3 as I say, "In whom are hid
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.420]   all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:38.580]   In verse 9, "In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead."
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.580]   Bodily.
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:44.220]   All the fullness of the Godhead is bodily in this one person.
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:48.740]   You don't add to God, well you don't add to Jesus Christ, therefore it's all in him.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:56.220]   And then he says in verse 10, "And you are complete in him, who is the head of all principality
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.220]   and power."
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.220]   Don't add to him.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.940]   It's an insult to him.
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:01.940]   Everything is in him.
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.340]   There is no need for any sort of help or of any assistance.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:15.340]   That is why some of us cannot abide nor tolerate a doctrine which tells us that Mary is a co-redemptrix.
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:21.260]   That is why we cannot grant that you need to pray to saints to help you, or to anybody
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.300]   else, or do your penances and pay for indulgences and so on.
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.940]   My friends, it is simply a denial of this teaching in the epistle to the Colossians,
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.860]   as it is a denial of the teaching of the whole of the Bible.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.780]   That in him and him alone there is no other intermediary.
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.780]   There is only one name.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:42.100]   There is one God and one mediator, and one and only mediator it means, between God and
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.780]   men, the man Christ Jesus.
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.220]   He is enough.
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.860]   He is the all-sufficient one.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.380]   He is the all and in all.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:54.060]   He is the Alpha and the Omega, the first, the last, the beginning, the end.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.540]   He is everything.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.540]   Rich because he is who he is.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:02.540]   But let me go on and draw these other deductions.
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:08.460]   Oh, let me remind you again that you get the same argument exactly in the very beginning
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.940]   of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:15.940]   Here were again Christian people who were being affected by false teaching, and they
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.540]   were being told that it was wrong to leave Judaism altogether.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:24.820]   "Now, now," says Paul, "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:31.020]   past unto the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken unto us in his Son,
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:35.580]   whom is the pointer heir of all things, who is the brightness of his glory and the express
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:41.660]   image of his person, who when he had by himself purged our sins, he had nobody helping him."
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.820]   He never did ever help, and you can't help him.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.340]   He's all, he's everything.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:50.340]   By himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.820]   And it's the same everywhere.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.740]   Very well, what is the point of saying all this?
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.300]   Well, it's this, you see.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.020]   It's this emphasis that it's all in him.
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:04.780]   "Whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.300]   There's only one Lord.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.300]   He's the Lord of all.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.100]   Yes, and he's rich.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:15.420]   And that is why it is all in him, because of this riches.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.900]   So I draw this deduction.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.740]   But because he is so rich, and because all the fullness of the God that is in him, he
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:28.940]   is able to give this salvation to anybody, to whosoever.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.300]   He is rich unto all that call upon him.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.300]   What it means, you see, is this.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:38.460]   Yes, there's somebody I can see that good, godly, religious people like the Jews should
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.820]   be saved by him.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.220]   But what about the Gentiles?
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.160]   What about the dogs who are outside?
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.900]   What about the people who are living the kind of life the Gentiles then lived as described
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.620]   in the second half of the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans?
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.420]   What about people who lived as Paul describes some of the Corinthians as living before they
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.420]   became Christians?
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:02.420]   Adulterers, effeminate, abusers of themselves with mankind, covetous thieves, drunkards,
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.420]   revilers, extortioners.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.420]   What about them?
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.420]   Can they be saved?
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.420]   The answer is, oh yes, why?
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.420]   Well, he is rich.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:16.420]   He is so rich, he can take any pauper that may like to come.
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.260]   He can take them all if necessary.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.100]   No sin is too great.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.460]   No man has committed too great a number of sins.
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.600]   You don't talk about numbers or the greatness of sin when you are thinking of his riches.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.580]   If you are talking about some moral standard, of course, the number of sins and the depth
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.580]   of sin is important.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:37.060]   But when you are talking about the riches of God, you don't worry about this.
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.100]   One man can be saved as easily as another.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.100]   There is no distinction.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.020]   There is no difference.
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.620]   No sin is too great.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.420]   No one can have sinned too many sins.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.620]   No ignorance is too profound.
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:58.740]   You see, this is a way of salvation that postulates nothing in men, but which preaches the riches
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:03.460]   of his grace, the fullness that is in him.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:07.580]   So the next deduction I draw is that he is sufficient to give to all.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:13.620]   Now, it is wonderful to watch the great apostle bringing out these points.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.820]   You see, he could never think of them or mention them without being thrilled and moved to the
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:18.820]   very depths of his being.
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:24.180]   Let me read it to you after the second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:30.060]   In the first three verses, he describes the condition and the predicament and the appalling
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.460]   condition of men in sin, all men.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:37.980]   Then listen, verse four, "But God," what about him?
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.180]   "Oh, who is rich in mercy."
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:44.980]   See, the same word, rich in mercy.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.980]   And then he goes on, "This isn't enough.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:55.860]   For his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:00.620]   us together with Christ by grace he has saved, and hath raised us up together, and made us
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:05.180]   sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come he might show
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.380]   what?
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:10.580]   The exceeding riches of his grace."
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.500]   What a gathering of words.
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.500]   Grace, free, unmerited favor.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.660]   But the riches of his grace.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.820]   But on top of that, the exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:30.300]   And another word comes in, "In his kindness toward us through Jesus Christ."
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.680]   On he goes, he can't stop himself as he thinks of this.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:40.420]   So you notice that in the third chapter, he even added to that, "The exceeding riches
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.420]   of his grace."
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:46.220]   What am I talking about, he says in the eighth verse of the third chapter, "And to me whom
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:50.580]   less than the least of all saints is this grace given, that I should preach among the
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:56.940]   Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ."
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.100]   Not exceeding riches, unsearchable riches.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.880]   You never come to the end of them.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.420]   You can go on and everybody with you, searching, examining, collecting, putting down records,
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.420]   you'll never finish.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.500]   Unsearchable riches of Christ.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.740]   And then he goes on towards the end of the chapter.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:16.740]   He says, "You know, this is my great prayer for you, this, that God would grant you according
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.460]   to the riches of his glory."
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.300]   You can't get away from this word.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.380]   It's all so wonderful and so rich.
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.340]   "To be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man."
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:26.340]   Why?
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.780]   Well, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:34.060]   That you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend, get some glimmering
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:40.060]   understanding of, with all saints, what is the breadth and the length and the depth and
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:46.060]   the height, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.700]   You see, that's it.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.580]   That's the content of this little word, rich, that he slips here into this twelfth verse
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.060]   of the tenth chapter of his epistle to the Romans.
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:04.940]   And then he goes even beyond that, that he might be filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:09.640]   And you get filled with the fullness of God when Christ dwells in your heart by faith,
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.780]   because all the fullness of the God that is in him, and it is in him bodily.
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:18.620]   Well, you see, because of that, he's got it to give to everybody.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:23.260]   "You," says Paul to these Ephesians, "you are right outside, you are absolutely
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.260]   hopeless, without hope, without God in the world.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.260]   What's brought you in?
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:31.100]   The exceeding riches of his grace, the unsearchable riches of grace.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.780]   He's rich unto all that call upon him.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.180]   He's got enough for all."
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:41.140]   And then you see he gives us all we need.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:48.340]   It's not only for Jew and Gentile, not only for barbarian or Scythian, bond or free, male
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.340]   or female.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:55.900]   It is, and it is for these reasons, because of these riches.
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:37:01.180]   Everybody has a hope here, so that all divisions and distinctions are abolished and banished
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.660]   once and forever.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:10.340]   But I say, he not only can give it to anybody, he gives us all that we need, everything that
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.140]   we need.
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:17.140]   You notice that he pointed out to the Ephesians there, in the eighth verse of the second chapter,
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:23.280]   "For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.280]   of God."
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:29.740]   And that does mean, remember, that the faith is a gift of God.
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.980]   He gives you the faith.
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:32.980]   Yes he gives you.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:38.820]   It is the Spirit's rising beam.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.740]   And he gives us all we need, I say.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:47.140]   So the apostle has said in 1 Corinthians 1.30, "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:51.780]   God is made unto you wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption."
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.020]   What else do you need?
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:57.420]   Well, anything you may ever need, it's all in Christ.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:05.700]   There is nothing that you can ever need but that it will be found in him, in all its glorious
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.700]   all-sufficiency.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:14.260]   Have you noticed, my dear friends, how this glorious way of salvation is always described
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:18.380]   in terms of superlatives and of profusion?
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:24.660]   The same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:28.180]   Do you notice the terms that are used always?
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:33.220]   You get it, you see, even in the books of the prophets who looked forward and saw the
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.580]   coming of our Lord.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:41.260]   Listen to Isaiah in chapter 9, in that great prophetic word, "Unto us a child is born,
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:45.860]   unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:51.060]   be called Wonderful, Counselor of the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.060]   Peace."
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:58.780]   He's everything, and of the increase of his government and peace, there shall be no end.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:06.420]   So later on, this great evangelical prophet, so on, is able to issue a great and universal
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:07.420]   invitation.
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:12.900]   "Ho, every one that thirsteth," wherever you are, "come to the waters, and he that
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:19.060]   hath no money, come ye, buy, eat, ye come, buy wine and milk without money and without
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.060]   price."
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.740]   Wherever you are and whatever your condition, come!
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:26.900]   It's all here in all its fullness.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:32.460]   And then, you see, we get that most interesting incident recorded in the fourth chapter of
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.620]   Luke's Gospel, when our Lord really begins his ministry.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:42.220]   He's been baptized with the Spirit, and he has been tempted in the wilderness, and he
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:48.100]   comes back to his hometown of Nazareth, and as his custom was, he goes into the synagogue
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:53.500]   on the Sabbath day, and listen, "There was delivered unto him the book of the prophet
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:58.540]   Isaiah, and when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, 'The
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:01.220]   Spirit of the Lord is upon me.'
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.220]   What for?
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:08.740]   'Well, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor.'"
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.380]   Nobody else had ever been able to do that.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.580]   Here is one who can preach to the poor.
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:13.580]   Why?
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.300]   Well, because they've got nothing, but he's got everything.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.300]   Rich!
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:21.100]   "He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, recovering
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:25.180]   of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.180]   year of the Lord."
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:33.540]   There's a great summary again of the riches, but you've got it still more wonderfully in
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.180]   the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.260]   On Sunday mornings here, we're considering one of the greatest texts in the Bible, John
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:46.100]   1, 16, "of his fullness, of all we received, and grace upon grace."
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.860]   But look at him putting it in detail to the woman of Samaria in the fourth chapter.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:55.620]   "Jesus answered and said unto her, 'Whosoever drinketh of this water," that's to say the
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:41:01.060]   water in the well, "'shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water that I
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:06.940]   shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:11.460]   a well of water, springing up into everlasting life.'"
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.460]   There's no end to it.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.460]   Rich!
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.540]   You get the same thing in John 6, 35, where you read this.
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:25.260]   "Jesus said unto them, 'I am the bread of life; he that cometh to me shall never hunger;
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:30.060]   he that believeth on me shall never thirst.'"
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.060]   Rich!
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:39.460]   "'I am come,' he says in John 10, 10, "'I am come that they might have life, and that
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:45.700]   they might have it more abundantly,'" not just a little, "overwhelming, showered as
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.380]   it were upon us."
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.500]   I've already quoted to you Colossians 2, 10.
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:57.820]   "Ye are complete in him," absolutely complete.
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:05.140]   There is nothing conceivable but that we have it in him and we have it in all its fullness
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.860]   and in all its plenitude.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:15.300]   So you see, it is not surprising that the writers of our hymns, once they have truly
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:22.300]   known this, once a man has had the fullness of the Holy Spirit, he sees nothing but this,
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.820]   the riches of Christ.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.540]   Listen to Charles Wesley.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:37.260]   "Thou, O Christ, art all I want; more than all in thee I find."
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.260]   That's the expression.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:46.180]   "All I want, more than all in thee I find."
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.180]   Listen to him again.
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:55.060]   "Plenty as grace in thee is found, grace to cover all my sin."
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.500]   You need never worry about it.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:03.900]   The same Lord over all is rich unto all, grace to cover all my sin, plenteous grace.
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:14.980]   "Let the healing streams abound; make me, keep me pure within, thou of life, the fountain-heart.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.940]   Freely let me take of thee; spring thou up within my heart.
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.420]   Greatest to all eternity."
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.780]   Or take him in that hymn we sang just now, which I think is perhaps his greatest hymn
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.780]   of all.
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:35.820]   "Thou hidden source of calm repose, thou all-sufficient love divine, all-sufficient,
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.860]   rich unto all that call upon him."
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.460]   And then he gives you his list of things.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:45.140]   "Help and refuge from my foes, secure I am if thou art mine, thy mighty name.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:50.180]   Heaven is and keeps my happy soul above, comfort it brings, and power and peace and
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.820]   joy and everlasting love.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:58.580]   To thee, to me with thy dear name is given pardon and holiness and heaven is rich unto
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.820]   all that call upon him is everything.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:07.980]   Jesus, my all in all, thou art my rest in toil, my ease in pain, the medicine of my
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:15.020]   broken heart, in war my peace, in loss my gain, my smile beneath a tyrant's frown,
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:21.860]   in shame my glory and my crown, in want my plentiful supply, rich unto all that call
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:30.020]   upon him, in weakness mine almighty power, in bonds my perfect liberty, my light in Satan's
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:41.060]   darkest hour, my help and stay, whene'er I call, my life in death, my heaven, my all.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.380]   The same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him."
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.500]   Christian people, are you enjoying the riches?
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.780]   Do you know about it?
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:55.940]   Are you able to say, "Just as I am of that free love, the length, breadth, depth and
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:45:00.740]   height to prove, here for a season, then above.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:06.260]   O Lamb of God, I come."
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:10.420]   You see, the argument, don't draw these foolish distinctions between religious and
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:16.540]   irreligious, between Jews and Gentiles, between what a man was, don't bring it in, or what
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.540]   he wasn't.
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.620]   Don't talk about a great sinner and a little sinner.
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.620]   When you come to Christ, forget everybody, everything, nothing matters but what?
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.860]   Oh, that he is rich, he is rich.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:39.020]   All sufficient, love divine, plenteous grace, grace to cover all my sin, or as old John
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:45.500]   Bunyan put it, "Grace abounding to the chief of sinners."
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:49.620]   So you don't talk about human divisions and distinctions.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:58.460]   What matters is that he is the Lord of the whole universe and he has such riches that
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:06.460]   he can deal with the whole problem of sin without any difficulty, in general or in particular.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:13.180]   It pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell.
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:21.580]   "Praise my soul, the King of heaven, to his feet thy tribute bring, ransomed, healed,
[00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:22.580]   restored, forgiven.
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:27.900]   Oh, like thee his praise should sing.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:34.380]   Praise him, praise him, praise the everlasting King.
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:44.820]   The same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him."
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.540]   That is God's way of salvation.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:51.500]   Nothing matters but the riches of his grace.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:47:04.140]   Oh, Lord our God, we pray thee as thy servant of old prayed, oh, for a thousand tongues
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:17.140]   to sing my great Redeemer's praise, the glories of my God and King, the triumphs of his grace.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:25.100]   Oh, God, have mercy upon us that we are so slow to thank thee and to praise thee.
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:33.940]   Oh, Lord, open our eyes to the knowledge of this great riches, the unsearchable riches
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:40.660]   of Christ, who is so rich unto all that call upon him.
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:44.020]   Lord, fill us with thy Spirit.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:47.420]   Fill us, we pray thee, till our hearts shall overflow.
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:53.460]   Shed thy love abroad in our hearts by thy most blessed Holy Spirit, until we shall
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.820]   be lost in wonder, love, and praise.
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:04.260]   Oh, that I could forever sit like Mary at the Master's feet.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:10.060]   Be this my happy choice, my only care, delight, and bliss.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.180]   My joy, my heaven on earth.
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:16.300]   O, pray this, to hear the Bridegroom's voice.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:20.900]   Oh, love divine, how sweet thou art.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:26.060]   When shall I find my willing heart all taken up by thee?
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:36.100]   I thirst, I faint, I die to prove the greatness of redeeming love, the love of Christ to me.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:45.460]   Oh, Lord, open our eyes to the riches of thy grace, and then we know that we shall praise
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:53.700]   thee with the whole of our being and say, "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.740]   is within me.
[00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:59.580]   Bless his holy name."
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:05.540]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship in
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:12.020]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:20.380]   the remainder of this, our short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:29.980]   shall see him as he is, in all his glory and beauty and perfection, and be like him, until
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:41.180]   the story, saved by grace, and go on to all eternity, to marvel at the unsearchable riches
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.220]   of Christ.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.660]   Amen.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.580]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
