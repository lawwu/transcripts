[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620]   Like I'm out here, you probably heard me say it, I'm out here trying to save people's lives.
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.460]   And a lot of times people are like, "What the fuck are you talking about, Perkins, save
[00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.460]   people's lives?
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.540]   You wrote a goddamn book about optimizing and net fulfillment."
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.860]   And I use this example of, listen, when you pull somebody drowning in a pool, they're
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.780]   drowning and you pull them out, give them a mouth-to-mouth and get the water out or
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.820]   whatever and they're like, "Oh my God, you saved my life."
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.960]   I'm like, "Guess what?
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.660]   They're still going to fucking die.
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.960]   They're just not going to die that day.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.760]   They're still going to die, 100%.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.580]   So what have you given them?
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.740]   You've given them more choices, more time, more experience, more I love yous, more going
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.540]   to the opera, more hanging out with their grandmother.
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.940]   You've given them more of their life, right?
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.300]   More experience to have and then they ultimately die.
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.940]   And so with this book, when I get you to optimize for net fulfillment, I'm giving you more choices,
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.980]   more trips with grandma, more going to the opera, more charities, more ski trips, it's
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.980]   the same thing.
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.260]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.260]   money and travel.
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.100]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm a diehard optimizer who loves doing
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.140]   all the research to help you get the best experience in life without necessarily an
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.580]   expensive price tag.
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.840]   Though, here's a thought experiment.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.260]   Imagine that one day you die and you have all this money in your account, but actually
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.260]   you don't.
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.260]   How does that feel?
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.260]   You die with zero?
[00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.020]   Scary, like you did something wrong?
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.780]   That's exactly what today's guest recommends.
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.780]   He's Bill Perkins, a longtime hedge fund manager and energy trader, who's written a book called
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.820]   Die With Zero, getting all you can from your money and your life.
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.340]   I loved the book.
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.600]   You might have a lot of objections to his concept and I actually did before I read it,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.540]   but now I'm a huge convert.
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.920]   So we're going to dive into all of it.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.140]   We're going to talk about what it actually means to die with zero, why you might want
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.460]   to stop maximizing net worth and focus on net fulfillment, why you should bank memory
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.260]   dividends and the ways to do that for maximum ROI, why Bill thinks contrary to financial
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.620]   advice, you should save less money when you're young, why you should think about your life
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.820]   as distinct seasons or time buckets and how that can help you make the best choices about
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.620]   spending your money and a lot more.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.260]   So let's get started right after this.
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.980]   Bill, welcome to the show and thank you for being here.
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.980]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.980]   It's great to be here.
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.980]   Wow.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.980]   We got a lot to go over, don't we?
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.980]   I didn't even mention some of that.
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.980]   We got two daughters.
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.740]   There's a lot we could talk about, but your book's all about dying with zero and that
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.140]   many people save too much money and leave it behind instead of spending it in ways that
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.780]   are more meaningful.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.460]   You've obviously been very skilled and fortunate at building wealth.
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.060]   So before we jump into all these lessons, I just want to make sure I understand who
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.660]   this is for and does it actually apply to people with just a modest income or who haven't
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.780]   built wealth yet?
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.300]   So the book is a bunch of mental models, right?
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.640]   And it's a counterfactual regret minimization algorithm that's solving for net fulfillment.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.340]   So a lot of people have algorithms for building wealth, right?
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.500]   It's solving for building wealth.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.760]   I'm solving for net fulfillment.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.300]   And so what variables are the inputs?
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.460]   Your wealth, your health, and your time.
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.620]   Now, even though people may have more wealth or better health or more time, those variables
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.500]   still you can use formulaically with these mental models to maximize your net fulfillment.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.300]   So yeah, some people are - I wouldn't say this book isn't for unhealthy fat people,
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.540]   even though they can still get value out of this to maximize their own net fulfillment.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.740]   And the same thing for people with not that much money, right?
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:54.020]   Like obviously, a person who's oversaving by millions is formulaically getting more
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.340]   value in terms of the amount of waste that they're wasting by dying with a bunch of money
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.740]   in the bank, right?
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.420]   But everybody still gets value relative to them to get more out of this one ride called
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.420]   life.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.380]   And how do you define net fulfillment?
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:19.740]   So I basically say that the sum of your experiences, your choices, every moment in your life when
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.340]   you make a decision, those choices, that is what constitutes your life.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.860]   And the sum of all those decisions and experiences that you consume will determine whether you've
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.580]   had a full life or fulfilling life or not so fulfilling life relative to the best life
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.360]   you can possibly have, right?
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.900]   And so I define net fulfillment as your choices, i.e. your experiences.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.960]   And when I use experiences, I mean it in the broadest sense of the word.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.220]   I don't necessarily mean always taking a trip.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.860]   It could be walking with grandmother.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.540]   It could be donating to a charity.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.980]   It's just every single choice that you make.
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.420]   And before we jump in, I actually want to talk about a few common misconceptions because
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.860]   I feel like some of them came up a little bit late in the book.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.700]   Some of them came up early and I was like, "Oh, okay.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.140]   So I feel like this is important."
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.420]   So one I'll share and I'll ask if there are others is around retirement.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.200]   And it was that the amount you actually need in retirement is often lower than people think.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.060]   And it's no surprise that also people increase their assets in retirement.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.460]   Not all of them, but a good number of them.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.560]   And so something that was helpful for me to realize is if we're all thinking, "Oh, I should
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.540]   save all this money because I'm going to need it because I'm going to be spending."
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.880]   So it turns out you probably will spend less based on actual studies, not just your opinion.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.740]   And you might actually make more in retirement.
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.040]   Are there other things that might be common misconceptions people have that understanding
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.660]   might make this whole conversation easier to process in those mindsets?
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.660]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.540]   I think kind of adjacent to what you're saying about spending, the data is kind of overwhelming
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.020]   that people spend less, even adjusting for healthcare costs.
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.660]   People are like, "What about healthcare and rising healthcare?"
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.420]   It's their bodies, the deterioration, the change in our attitudes, et cetera.
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.300]   Their ability to do or enjoy certain activities.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.860]   I think probably all of us have a relative that doesn't like to fly.
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.380]   You could take them somewhere, but they're like, "I don't want to sit on the plane for
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.300]   three hours because it hurts my back or my knees or something to that effect."
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:25.000]   Or there's probably people my age or younger, 40s used to be athletic and could not go play
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.860]   a pickup game of flag football right now.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.900]   It wouldn't be as enjoyable.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.520]   They could play it.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.700]   And so, the misconception that's out there is people think their lives are going to be
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.860]   like a carnival commercial when they retire.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.400]   And it cannot be further from the truth.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.380]   And having lived in the Virgin Islands where these cruise lines all park up, like we'd
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.620]   have three, four to seven ships during high season coming in and the main activity is
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.840]   going into the shops, right?
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.480]   Not these athletic activities, right?
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.100]   To buy something, not for themselves, but for their granddaughters or a relative, etc.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:07.140]   They're actually looking for ways to consume the money that they have because they cannot
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.380]   consume it into the experiences that they thought they could.
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.740]   - Yeah, but you talk about the declining utility of money with age.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.700]   You have all this money and you say, "Oh, I'm going to punt on this awesome, amazing
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.260]   trip until I'm retired and I can take time off work."
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.660]   And then you're like, "I don't know.
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.060]   Do I really want to go walk around Japan nonstop?"
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:29.380]   I say this because I took my family, my sister, her husband, my parents to Japan.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.160]   And the degree to which we wanted the kids to go explore was just not the degree to which
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.620]   my parents were willing to go.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.380]   And I don't know if they would have thought that was the case 20 years ago, but there
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.220]   were things they had to miss out on because they're just older and they couldn't keep
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.220]   up.
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.220]   - Yeah.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.220]   I think a lot of people have the model in their head that their ability to convert money
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.540]   into experiences, like your body is some sort of like it's static, right?
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.820]   It will remain the same, right?
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.980]   They kind of divorce this idea that, "Wow, my mental acuity is going to decline, my lung
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.820]   capacity is going to decline, my bone density is going to decline, my muscle mass is going
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:09.960]   to decline about 1% a year after age like 35."
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:16.080]   And so, they don't put all these facts together in that, "Hey, this is obviating either my
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.080]   desire or ability to actually enjoy these activities," right?
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.180]   And so, you have a prime example of walking around Japan and Tokyo.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.820]   And so, they delayed that trip or that gratification.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:33.540]   Let's just assume they did to a point where there really wasn't any gratification, right?
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.340]   Tokyo was less valuable trip to them.
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.180]   - I wouldn't say there wasn't, but it was certainly, I think there were things where
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.780]   we came home and we're like, "Oh, you missed this thing."
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.540]   And I think they were like, "We're okay because if we had pushed ourselves, it would have
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.160]   been a mess," and we had a great trip.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.480]   I think they had a great trip.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.220]   But I think that five, 10 years ago, they would have gotten to do 20% more and it would
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.220]   have been a better trip.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.500]   - I mean, you do the best with what you have, right?
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.540]   There's no sense in crying over spilt milk or what they did or didn't do.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.860]   But you can easily look at the scenario and say, "That was not the optimal time for them
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.940]   to take that trip in the totality of the arc of their lives," right?
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.140]   We don't get to play a sim game and Monte Carlo our lives and be like, "Well, let me
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.500]   do this trip here and that," whatever.
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:19.500]   But what I try to do with this book is get people to think about how do I optimize for
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.660]   net fulfillment?
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.980]   Where do experiences belong?
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.260]   What experience - first, what experiences do I want, right, in my life, right?
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.740]   And then very importantly, where do those experiences belong?
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.700]   Where does the trip to Japan belong?
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.220]   Where does going to the opera belong?
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.700]   Where does hiking this mountain belong?
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.540]   When does the ski trip belong?
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.540]   And that matters.
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.100]   It may matter more than the what.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:47.380]   I mean, I'll give an example that you basically put on a banger of a 50th birthday party,
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.820]   but you decided to just do it when you were 45 because it would be a better experience.
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.220]   So to me, that was a big mower.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.820]   It's like, oh, you always think, "Let's do this thing at this milestone in life."
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.300]   And you're just like, "Let's just do it earlier so that I get more out of it."
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.420]   There's other smaller examples.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.300]   I was in an island and guys were going to go wakeboarding.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.580]   You may have heard me say this and I was like, "No, I'm just going to chill here, relax,
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.580]   etc."
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.660]   And I have a degenerative cartilage in L3, L4.
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.260]   And so, my wakeboarding days are limited, right?
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:24.780]   And if I was going to go wakeboarding, it's not five years from now, right?
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.260]   And then I was like, "Okay, when is the next time I'm going to be on an island where it's
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.820]   warm and there's actually a wakeboard and a wakeboard boat with these friends, etc.,
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.100]   to go wakeboarding that I physically can do it?"
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.060]   I quickly came to the conclusion, "Never.
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.340]   It's now or never.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.820]   This is the last wakeboarding chance I'm probably going to have for the rest of my life."
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:51.020]   And so, I quickly said, "I can lounge on the beach and relax until my 80s, right?
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.020]   I can't go wakeboarding.
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.700]   So, now is the time to go wakeboarding."
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.500]   So, I got on the boat and said, "I'm just going to go do this."
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.320]   And that was my last wakeboarding ever.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.740]   I have a similar experience, but it wasn't my last.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:07.060]   I had always, as a kid, been a skateboarder, snowboarder, and I'd always wanted to go wakeboarding.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.260]   And for some reason, just the opportunity never arose.
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.100]   And finally, I was like, "You know what?
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.860]   I'm not getting to the point that I couldn't wakeboard in five years, but I'm getting to
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.380]   the point that if I want to try to do crazy stuff on a wakeboard, I probably should do
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.380]   it now."
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.940]   And then we rented a boat.
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.720]   My brother-in-law and I went out and literally the boat was defective and could not go fast
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   enough to do anything.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:32.160]   So, I still need to get that checked off my list because we basically were just like trolling
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.160]   around on this boat.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.840]   And we got a refund, which was cool, but I still haven't ticked that one off.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.280]   And you talk about trying to bucket these things.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.840]   So, you have all these ideas in life.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.680]   Your theory is instead of saying, "Make this big list," you can have a bucket list, but
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.160]   you kind of have this anti-bucket list.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.280]   So, why is bucketing things so different than a bucket list and why is the distinction important?
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.040]   I like to go backwards to either zero and infinity to try and get a concept across.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.440]   So, let's just go back to just before you were born, you're in heaven or wherever the
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.720]   universe, the matrix creators, whatever your thing is.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:15.960]   And then God says to you, "What experiences do you want to have on your journey on planet
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.960]   Earth?"
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.680]   You have 86 years, 79 years, whatever it is, right?
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.680]   What experiences do you want to have?
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.280]   And you go to the hall of experiences, which is really the hall of choices, right?
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.440]   You're like, "I want to go skateboarding this many times, I don't want to have sex, and
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.760]   I'm going to go traveling, I want to have kids, I want to get a degree, I want to say
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.340]   I love you this many times."
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.800]   Every single thing you think of, "I'm going to donate charities, I'm going to whatever,"
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.740]   you throw it into your bucket, infinite bucket of experiences.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.760]   It's not infinite because you're a human, etc.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.420]   God goes, "Great.
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.480]   You can have all those experiences.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.480]   There's only one problem.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.200]   You have to get the order right."
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.000]   The guy who puts the like, "I want to go hella skiing" and puts it in the 80 to 85 bucket
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.520]   probably doesn't get to go hella skiing, right?
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:04.260]   Because our decisions are dynamic, our body has a health curve, utility curve, and certain
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.800]   things belong in certain areas, right?
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:17.440]   So, I pick like kind of these cartoon exaggerated examples, right, of the why the timing matters,
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.440]   right?
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.360]   How many experiences belong when, but there's tons of them.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:28.000]   You know, people have kids and they're like, "Oh, I'm going to hang out with my kids when
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.400]   they're 13 or 14 more.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.280]   We're going to go this, I'm going to wait for this," and your kids don't want to know
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.320]   you when you're 13 or 14 or they don't want to do the same activities when you're younger.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.560]   And people are very acutely aware of how they spend time with their kids and what activities
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.800]   they can do with their kids at certain periods in their life and certain seasons of life.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.280]   But that applies to everyone, right?
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:53.800]   In every relationship, even business, your health, spiritual, etc.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:02.160]   And so, not only are there limits, there's your attitude changes, certain experiences
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.320]   are orthogonal to other experiences.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.080]   I like to use the strip club in marriage, but that's just me, off-color humor, you know
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080]   what I mean?
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.200]   But you get it, right?
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.080]   Like my flag football days are done, man.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:19.040]   I'm not trying to pull a hamstring twist the knee, etc. because of my body, the recovery
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.040]   time.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.720]   Not that I can't do it, not that it wouldn't be fun while I'm doing it, but it would be
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.400]   less enjoyable afterwards and it wouldn't be as enjoyable, let's say, in my 20s or 30s.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.040]   Like, "Hey, let's go play flag football after work."
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.240]   I would never say that now, right?
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.240]   Never ever, right?
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:41.800]   So, if I had in my bucket of experiences flag football with the fellas, you know, that had
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:48.480]   to happen in the 20 to 30 bucket, 20 to 33 bucket for me.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.080]   - We haven't talked about memory dividends, but I think it's interesting because just
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:58.080]   because you did that in your 30s doesn't mean you don't get value out of it in your 40s
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.080]   or your 50s or your 60s.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.720]   And I think that was one of the, I mean, I don't know, it's just something I'd never
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.920]   seen or heard or thought about, which was you could stack these memories throughout
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.600]   the rest of your life if you actually do them and enjoy them and document them maybe to
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   enhance it.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.920]   - Yeah, the purpose of money is to fulfill your life, right?
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.840]   It's for your consumption, right?
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.600]   You want to use all your resources that you have, your wealth and health and time to get
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.520]   the maximum fulfillment, right?
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.520]   So, let's just go with that.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:30.080]   And then, so, the question is when I'm saving, I always ask people this, "What are you saving
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   for?"
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.800]   And they're like, "Oh, they'll give me some abstract, like retirement."
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.760]   I'm like, "No, no, no, like house, home, whatever, okay, I want to survive, I'll give you survival."
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.880]   Once your survival is covered, what are you saving for?
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.440]   I want to know exactly in your mind, what are you saving for, right?
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.800]   And sometimes people will give me like a very definitive answer of like, I want to take
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:57.280]   this trip, I want to go to the opera, I want to be able to take a cruise every single year
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.540]   of my life from 66 to the grave or whatever it is.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.680]   But a lot of times it's in abstract land, right?
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.560]   It's just kind of this autopilot answer.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:16.160]   And when you save money, it's attached to some future consumption or experience, right?
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.600]   And that experience is going to give you some sort of fulfillment or joy, right?
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:28.280]   When you consume an experience, you have joy from that experience but also when you recall
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.280]   that experience and revisit that experience, you get joy from it.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.460]   So, it pays a dividend, what I call the memory dividend.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:42.600]   Anybody who's had a first kiss, hit a game-winning home run, you know, they've told that story
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.380]   over and over again, right?
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.360]   And when they tell that story and they recall that story, they get a sense of fulfillment
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.360]   from it.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.480]   That experience, that original experience is paying a dividend and also creating a new
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:17:00.200]   memory as I discuss with you, "Hey, my backpacking trip or my trip to Asia, etc."
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.720]   And that adds up to our fulfillment.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.480]   The same way - now, you can do it the other way around, right?
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.340]   You could say, "Well, here is the original experience and here are the dividends and
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.560]   here's the total fulfillment there or I could put the money in this investment, it will
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:18.040]   pay dividends, I'll have more money and I'll buy more experiences in the future, right?
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.780]   And we have to weigh these two things out to optimize it.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:29.480]   Is it better to take one ski trip now with my friends and buddies or two ski trips 10
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.400]   years from now, right?
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.680]   Because the money is for consumption, right?
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.240]   We're going to use it all, right?
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:41.480]   So, the question is, when is the best time to allocate and which provides the total return
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.480]   on fulfillment?
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.840]   What gets me the highest fulfillment, right?
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.960]   And if you're - depending on who you are, what your age is and the things you like,
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.560]   you know, going through that mental exercise may produce different results but you know,
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:01.400]   for me, you know, at 53, a lot of the times, the answer is not two trips 10 years from
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   now.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:09.920]   It's the activity now plus the dividends will surely exceed two of the activity later
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.960]   in life, right?
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.160]   And you can just calculate what that return is.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.800]   Is it as simple as there - you have kind of a rule of thumb where it's like, for however
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.640]   many years in the future, this thing will be a memory, you know, it is worth, I don't
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.600]   know, 10% more every year?
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.880]   Is there some simple math that makes it easy?
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:35.520]   For me, I just deeply think about it like, you know, I sit down like wakeboarding.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.200]   There is no future wakeboarding, right?
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.440]   It might have been two wakeboarding trips later, spend the money, be with your friends,
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440]   etc.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.840]   But generally, you know, as you get older, I think the answer is kind of like when you're
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:52.880]   20, 22, maybe two ski trips, two and a half ski trips at 30 is a much better deal.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.000]   You're more mature, you'll have your stuff together, other things been going on, I'll
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.400]   have some friends, it'll be bigger and better, I can afford the upgrade, whatever.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   Maybe it's a better trip.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.840]   For me at 53, two ski trips is not the answer.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.360]   Well, I also think, I mean, you just said afford the upgrade and it made me think, you
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.480]   know, I went on this trip, my wife and I, and I hadn't read your book.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.240]   So somehow I had this spark of let's quit our jobs and let's spend all our savings and
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.080]   let's backpack around the world for seven months.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.160]   And we did this in our 20s.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:26.800]   I am 100% certain that the money that we spent wouldn't even buy one trip around the world
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.640]   for two months now that we have a different lifestyle, we have kids and all this stuff.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:37.440]   So I think it's especially interesting for someone in their 20s or early 30s, you know,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.600]   foregoing that trip now isn't going to let your money grow to be two trips because I'm
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.120]   almost certain that by the time that money is enough for the two trips, the cost of a
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.240]   trip is going to be twice or three times as much.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.240]   It might not even be enough to go on one.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.240]   - Right.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.320]   You're including also the economic inflation of the trip, also the fact that you become
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.320]   more bougie as you get older, right?
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.680]   Like it's hard to do the youth hostel backpacking thing as you get older.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.360]   That's not even a physical thing.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.560]   That's like your attitude changes.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.520]   You realize that certain activities, you know, this going back to this time bucketing, belong
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.320]   in your 20s and they don't transfer well to your 30s.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.280]   Now you may be able to do them, but it's just not as enjoyable or to cost, you know, infinite
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:30.240]   more money or whatever it is and that the 20s activity, not only do you get to enjoy
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.760]   it more, but you get to enjoy the discussion, the memories, the conversation, it's the thing
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.160]   that makes you interesting, right?
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.520]   Like when I sit down and talk with somebody at a dinner, I just met them, you know, I'd
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.800]   say 80% of the conversation is what have they done?
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.080]   What experiences that they have?
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.440]   What were their learnings?
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.760]   You know, what has been their journey, right?
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.800]   And maybe 20% is what they're going to do or what's going on currently, et cetera, right?
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.560]   And that is kind of like what drives your fulfillment when you're meeting somebody,
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.560]   right?
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.560]   It makes you an interesting character.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:05.720]   And so getting the order right and figuring out, "Hey, is it worth it to delay or not?"
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.840]   is a very personal thing, right?
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   And it's very dependent on which activities or things fulfill you, but it's definitely
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.040]   the thought process that you want to go through.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   - Yeah.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.880]   I mean, my takeaway so far is don't necessarily focus on accumulating money to all extent
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.120]   because you can use that money earlier to create experiences that provide value the
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.120]   rest of your life.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.600]   - I mean, if the purpose is like, I'm going to get the max value, right?
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.360]   And I say the max value is fulfillment, you got to change your optimization algorithm
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.480]   in your head to optimize for fulfillment.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.640]   A lot of people keep optimizing for money.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.120]   And I'm like, "Listen, okay, why don't you optimize for the most money at 86?"
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.520]   And they'll obviously will go, "No, that's dumb," right?
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:58.480]   Well, it's the same thing is true at 85 or 84 or 83 or any year, we should be optimizing
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.080]   for fulfillment.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.160]   Money is just a tool for your fulfillment.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.640]   You are not a tool to make money.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.680]   And a lot of people are operating in the latter, not the former.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.680]   - Yeah.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.200]   I want to come back to identifying that, but there's a couple of few things on kind of
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.120]   bucketing experiences and memory.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.600]   One that comes to mind, it's kind of interesting to me.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:24.400]   So we had a wedding as many people do, and we paid for a photographer and videographer,
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.160]   although many people that have listened know that we negotiated to pay for the videographer
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.200]   by swapping frequent flyer miles instead of dollars, because we wanted to get a deal.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:37.100]   But looking back, my wife and I, that video has not been seen by millions of people.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.760]   It's friends and family, and we've watched it every few years.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:47.020]   But I think it's really reinforced the memory of the wedding, and the photos do the same.
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:52.120]   I'm curious if there are any other tactics that can kind of enhance the dividends that
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:57.520]   our memories pay, so that we can get more value of them after we have them.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:04.000]   - I think technology is doing something wonderful, like with your phone will now, Google will
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.960]   do it, Google Photos or iPhones will do this, they'll be on this date, right?
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.560]   And then photos will pop up of what happens, right?
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:16.100]   And then you get joy out of that, and it sparks a conversation, you get fulfillment from an
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.720]   experience that you had and the recall of it.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:24.440]   So it's triggering and tapping in to your memory dividend, right?
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.720]   Your memories to provide you value.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:35.680]   I have a jar, like one of the gifts my fiancee at the time gave me was a box and it had photos
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.200]   and memories and little comments on what it was, right?
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.060]   And I was like, this is the best gift, right?
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:47.960]   This is like helping me get to relive this value, zero cost, right?
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:56.780]   Like close to zero costs of any kind of purchase, et cetera, paper, cards, some photos printed
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.920]   out, et cetera, and her perspective.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.760]   But it was amazing on how much joy it was, and really was, I was just mining the prior
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.600]   experience and experience dividend.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.640]   If somebody, you know, and really, if somebody comes up with another tool or another idea
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.920]   or another method, I'm open to it, right?
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.640]   I really want to mine the memory dividend and get the most out of my investments and
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.520]   my investments are, I invest in experiences.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.000]   Just like Warren Buffet says, right?
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   When do you start investing?
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Early, early, early, now, now, now, right?
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.080]   In order to get the maximum, what I call memory dividend, maximum return.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.000]   - Yeah, I mean, so it's, in some ways everyone says, you know, compound interest is so important,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.320]   you should invest as early as you can to have the most money possible.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.800]   You're saying, I have the same principle.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.440]   It's just, I'm not optimizing for money.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.900]   So invest, invest, invest as early as possible in the kinds of experiences that will maximize
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.900]   your fulfillment of life.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.660]   So, you know, when people are focused on returns and compound interest, et cetera, they're
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.800]   optimizing for maximum money, right?
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.000]   That's a vertical, right?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.600]   Your wealth, getting your wealth up, right?
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.700]   And there's lots of books and lots of tools, tricks, hacks on how to get the most out of
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.320]   every dollar you spend, how to make the most money, et cetera.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.160]   But I'm at a top level optimization, right?
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:13.440]   I'm at a much higher optimization on like your life fulfillment, your net fulfillment.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:19.600]   And that is, the memory dividend is a huge part, huge calculation in it.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.080]   And I really encourage people to invest in making those memory dividends, or at least
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:31.880]   think about that when you're deciding whether to delay gratification or actually have gratification
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.880]   now.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.840]   - Yeah, one thing that's helped me in this is, if you think about the marginal dollar
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.880]   that you're saving, and so often I hear people, and this is probably people with a little
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.560]   more money, but they're like, "Oh, well, I should save more money."
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.560]   And I'm like, "Well, why?"
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.200]   And they're like, "Well, then I'll have more money and I'll get a higher net worth."
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.680]   And I say, "Well, what's that next marginal dollar gonna do for you?"
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.880]   Because people always say, "Well, if I save an extra $1,000 a month, that's my kid's college."
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.360]   And it's like, "Well, do you already have your kid's college saved?
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.600]   Because if so, then what's that extra dollar doing?
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.280]   And would that extra dollar actually be better spent today?"
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:08.080]   - Yeah, going back to, I try and get people to map their money to what the consumption
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.080]   is.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.440]   You know, a lot of people are saving, they're like, "Oh, I'm saving, I'm working."
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.320]   I'm like, "Listen, it's okay to save.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.120]   Just tell me what the party is and when's the party.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.820]   Just tell me when the party is, I'm okay with it, right?"
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:20.820]   And they're kind of like, "Uh..."
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.200]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.880]   Like it gets them thinking like, "Well, 65, no, that's not really when I have the party.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.520]   Wait, what kind of party do I have?
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.480]   What are the things I really want to do?"
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.960]   Because what happens is, I believe is people get habituated, right?
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.760]   They get really good at optimizing for money, making money, doing deals, whatever it is
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.960]   they are, programmers, et cetera, right?
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.160]   And they keep piling it, right?
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.160]   And you know, much like a rat in a wheel with the cheese, right, experiment, pretty soon
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.440]   you can just show them the wheel and not give them the cheese.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.720]   There's no reward, right?
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:57.480]   And so people are in default mode network of accumulating wealth, right?
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.520]   Making money, earning money, optimizing money.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.280]   I read the book on how to save on this.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.240]   I got 18 million Fleetwood Flyer miles.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.240]   I discounted that.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:09.200]   I've got all, look at all these Chuck E. Cheese tokens I got.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.560]   And then they die with a bunch of Chuck E. Cheese tokens and never really go to Chuck
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.560]   E. Cheese.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.680]   And I'm like, "When are you going to Chuck E. Cheese?"
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.680]   You know?
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.000]   You've been running this rat wheel, right?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.520]   You got all these tickets, everything, but what are we buying here?
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.760]   What are we saving for?
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:33.600]   And I think people become detached from what their original dream was.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.800]   What they really wanted to do such that the game and the puzzle solving, right?
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.960]   People become addicted to the puzzle of saving more money as opposed to being addicted to
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.040]   the puzzle of how do I fulfill my life?
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.040]   What potluck thing am I going to do?
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.200]   How do I expose myself to other things?
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.700]   What choices should I be making today?
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.440]   What experiences do I want in this time period of my life and the next time period of life?
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.600]   And how do those fit together?
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.960]   They're more focused on a different puzzle.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.800]   When it comes to these bucketing of experiences, is there a number of years that you say, "Well,
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:11.720]   try to bucket them in tranches of five years or 10 years, or how do you think about that?"
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.600]   So people can actually go home and be like, "Let's start doing this today."
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.360]   I hope people listening start that process tonight.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:25.400]   Generally, I try and do five years earlier, but when I got to my 65, I broke it out 65
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.400]   to 75.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   Right?
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.400]   It gets wider, right?
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.800]   Because obviously, the further you go in future, the less your visibility, right?
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.880]   Like the less your visibility - even for yourself, right?
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.400]   Like I know like, "Okay, yeah, 53 to 58, this is what I want to do.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.400]   I want to do this.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.400]   I want to take a train.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.560]   I want to go to my daughter's graduation.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.080]   I want to you know, stay healthy.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.080]   I want to go on a trip.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.520]   I want to go to Tokyo again.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.640]   You know, I have all those things kind of down, right?
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.600]   And then the next five years, it gets harder.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.200]   I kind of think I want to be doing this, right?
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.160]   So, they're a little bit more thematic, right?
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:02.240]   And then, you know, 65, 75, 75 to the grave, you know, it gets even more thematic.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:09.600]   But I can tell you that when I look at those choices, when I try and time bucket my life,
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.080]   I can see the level of activity going down.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.280]   I see it harder for me to spend money.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:21.960]   You know, it's like visit grandchildren, hang out with daughters, read the books I haven't
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.960]   read.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.600]   You know, it's not like go raging, stay up till 7 a.m. in a club in Tokyo, you know,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.680]   travel here, swim that, right?
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.760]   And so, if you could perfectly lay out the experiences you wanted to have, which you
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.200]   can't, right?
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:44.880]   You would see this natural curve in the cost of those experiences, right?
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.320]   This natural consumption pattern, right?
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:53.560]   And then you start to say, well, I don't want to work, give up hours of my life for a bunch
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.480]   of Chuck E. Cheese tokens that I'm not going to use.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.800]   So, I'm going to go to Chuck E. Cheese and then you start to lay out, well, I'm probably
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.200]   going to go to Chuck E. Cheese a lot here, I'll play the whack-a-mole game that costs
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.600]   a lot and I do whatever and another time I'm just going to sit around and eat pizza, right?
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.920]   And then you have this nice, beautiful curve on consuming and spending your money down
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.560]   to zero as you have the most fulfilling Chuck E. Cheese experience, basically, the most
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.560]   fulfilling life.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.560]   I don't know why I'm stuck on Chuck E. Cheese, but I am for some reason.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.040]   I was trying to teach her, I was actually watching, this is strange, but last night
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.720]   or two nights ago, we talked about Chuck E. Cheese randomly and I was showing our au pair
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.400]   from Spain what Chuck E. Cheese was because she was like, "I have no idea what you're
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.400]   talking about."
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.600]   I was like, "Man, Chuck E. Cheese has kind of become a more depressing place than I remember
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   it in my childhood."
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.200]   So, when you're talking about it, I'm like, "Oh man, I don't want to be the Chuck E. Cheese
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.200]   guy.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.200]   I don't want to be going there in my 50s."
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.200]   It's kind of funny.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.400]   It's kind of, to me, like cold water.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.640]   I was like, going into the Atlantic Ocean, I was like, "Wow, I used to go in here as
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.640]   a kid all the time.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.640]   Like, no problem.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.640]   Now it's freezing.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.640]   I would never go in there."
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.640]   Right?
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.640]   And that's kind of like an activity if you're in heaven.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   It's like, go swimming and frolicking and body surfing in the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.960]   You're probably not going to enjoy it as much as when you were nine or five and immune to
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.080]   the cold for whatever reason, because it was just so we.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.440]   When you're like 20 something, you're like, "This is freezing.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.800]   Like, why am I here?"
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   You know, that type of thing.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.040]   Are there any experiences that, you know, maybe you regret not doing more of younger
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   or things that people listening in their 20s and 30s should maybe prioritize more?
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:28.920]   I mean, for me, you know, I think it's very, very personal and it has to do with like travel,
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:34.720]   that kind of backpacking experience, that kind of gap year thing that people do.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:39.160]   I just really didn't take advantage of that time period.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:45.040]   I was so focused on trying to get ahead and make money and not taking breaks and was on
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.800]   this autopilot of like must succeed, right?
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:55.160]   And not saying that that wasn't a great focus and didn't help me get to here, but the success
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.660]   I want is the most fulfilling life.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:02.120]   And I gave up things that would have been extremely fulfilling, not only then, but now
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.880]   as I look back on my life, right?
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.280]   And that's going to be different for everybody, right?
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.760]   But like, I wish I went to go play in this chess tournament, you know, whatever, you
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.920]   know, like it could be anything.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:19.540]   But you know, I knew at an early age that travel and meeting new cultures and doing
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.280]   adventurous things really fulfills me.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.560]   I really enjoy that.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.600]   And I did not take advantage of those opportunities that I had, right?
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.720]   I kind of didn't really think about the context of my life, like, you know, I can go to a
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.240]   club in Manhattan any day.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.120]   I can hang out in this weekend any day.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:40.040]   Like, why don't I get the super saver ticket, go here for the weekend, come back, you know,
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.360]   come back, etc.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.360]   You know, that type of thing.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:47.000]   So I think I was really lucky because I got laid off in 2008.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.560]   And so I didn't have a job.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.440]   And my wife was working at a company that she just absolutely hated and didn't want
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.940]   to stay in that field.
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:57.320]   And so we kind of got forced in this situation where she was like, well, I'm going to quit
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.320]   my job.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.320]   And I don't know what's next.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.820]   And I already didn't have a job.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:06.280]   So we ended up taking this trip for seven months, backpacking, just as you describe.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:10.620]   But I think it would have been so much harder had at least one of us not been forced out
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.660]   of a job and kind of pushed into this.
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:18.880]   And so what I'm curious to get your take on is the culture of work in America, at least,
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:24.340]   and probably many other countries, makes it so hard to be like, let's take a year off.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:29.080]   Or, you know, now I'm thinking in 30s and 40s, let's cut back.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.000]   So I'm not grinding so hard.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.160]   Or, you know, my wife's thinking, you know, in her career, she's like, oh, wow, if I ever
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:39.920]   got another job, like it's got to level it up, got to level it up, whereas usually leveling
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.160]   it up is more responsibility and more time.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:49.040]   How can people in the work environment we've created in this country, kind of still live
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:52.560]   to these ideals and not get caught in that hamster wheel?
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.520]   It's really tough to escape your culture.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.280]   Culture changes slowly.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:05.200]   With regards to work and like, optimizing for, you know, not being afraid of running
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.840]   out of money and status and having more and more money, it's really hard to step back
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.320]   and go, wait, wait, wait, does this serve me, right?
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.000]   Does this serve my one and only life that I have?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.200]   Is this really going to fill me?
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:23.160]   Or have I become a robot hamster in a wheel, right?
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:29.040]   Just grinding and a puzzle addicted to solving this puzzle called more money, more status,
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.520]   more fame, et cetera.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.280]   And so, you know, I call that autopilot, right?
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.440]   I say we're always on autopilot, you know, I'm on autopilot just as much as the next
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.320]   person and we have to snap out of it and be like, what really fulfills me?
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.160]   What do I really want out of life?
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.680]   What do I really want out of life out of these next five years, right?
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.520]   And we're so trained, like, I want the promotion and I want the thing.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.760]   Why do you want the promotion?
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.720]   Because the promotion, the thing and I have more money.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.560]   Why do you want the more money?
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.080]   The more money is better, the thing, you know what I mean?
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.160]   It's all the way down, right?
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.240]   It's so inculcated into us, right?
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:13.400]   About success, success is more money and it's an abstract that we lose the final connection
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.280]   that money is an abstract, it's a tool, it's a hammer and a saw.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.280]   It's like a hammer and a saw.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:23.040]   It's like builders don't want hammers and saws because they love hammers and saws.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.200]   They want hammers and saws to build houses.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.480]   That is the goal, right?
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:32.640]   And so, they're not like must accumulate more hammers and saws, more hammers and saws, right?
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.640]   This is how people are.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:38.360]   They're like, we must accumulate more money to have more money to more money, money, money.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.080]   And I'm like, no life, motherfucker.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.560]   We're here to fulfill your life, like you are solving the wrong problem.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.840]   We're optimizing for the wrong problem.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:53.360]   And culture has pretty much jammed that on everyone, right?
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.680]   Really hard, right?
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.840]   Really hard because there's this fear of not having money, right?
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.080]   You don't want to run out of money and fear of retirement, like there's this whole fear
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.240]   game with retirement, right?
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:07.960]   And the debt is so overwhelming that those who save, save too much.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:13.840]   Like they just can never - people ask, why do old people keep growing their wealth while
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.840]   they're older?
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.240]   Because they can't spend it down.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.240]   Life has passed them by.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.960]   That's the cold hard truth, right?
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.240]   Like I'm really harsh about that.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.520]   I'm like, they fucked it up.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.680]   That's why they can't spend it down.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.240]   They fucked it up and it's too late for them.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:34.840]   And so, you know, my book, these algorithms, these mental models are to help you not fuck
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.840]   it up as much.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.120]   We're all going to fuck it up a little bit, right?
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.360]   Like it can't be perfect, right?
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.920]   But it's like, let's not fuck it up.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:46.360]   I worked with this woman whose job - you wrote a book - her job is to kind of help people
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.760]   take their outlook on life that might have some different unconventional contrarian thoughts
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.760]   and like really kind of boil it down to actual, some framework, some model.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.960]   And we kind of arrived at like my nine principles of living an optimized life.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:03.840]   And I'm not ready to share them all yet, but one of them was kind of questioning the outcome
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.840]   you actually want.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.920]   And I want to bring it up because of what you just said earlier.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.960]   I met someone who said, "Gosh, I need more money."
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.960]   Like, "Why do you need more money?"
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.960]   I said, "Well, I want to spend more time with my kids.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.800]   And if I have more money, I'll be able to retire sooner and spend more time with my
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.800]   kids."
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.520]   And through this conversation, we were like, "Well, what if you had a different job that
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.920]   earned you a little less money, but gave you the freedom to work four days a week or something.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.000]   And now you have a whole day that you could spend more time with your kids and you weren't
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   grinding as hard."
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.440]   And they're like, "Well, then I wouldn't have any money."
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.160]   And I was like, "Well, you don't need the more money anymore because you don't need
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.800]   to retire early to spend your time with your kids at 50.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.580]   You could start spending it now."
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.880]   And so this thing that I've really been processing is, and in product management, when we're
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.360]   building software and talking to customers, we always ask the five whys.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.360]   So someone says, "Oh, I want this."
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.320]   And it's like, you've got to ask why five times before you actually understand what
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.560]   someone wants.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.320]   So I'll challenge people thinking they want more money to go through that thought experiment
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.280]   themselves, being like, "Why do you want the more money?"
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.800]   And drill down.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.360]   And then ask yourself, is there actually, once you get to that fifth why, a way you
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.560]   could achieve what you want that actually isn't about just accumulating more money?
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.240]   And I would argue that more often than not, the answer will be yes.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:14.780]   - The book, "Your Money, Your Life" kind of hits on this concept of enough and what
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.700]   are you really solving for, right?
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.800]   Like, you're doing, like, spend more time with your kids, but making more money to save
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   time with your kids.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.820]   But if you make more money, are they really kids then?
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.300]   Do they want to spend time with you?
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.860]   You know, there's a lot of variables going on, right?
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:33.860]   But going through that thought experiment, I think you find out you actually get to pull
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.860]   out more from them.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.540]   It's like, it's really about the status.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.740]   It's really because you've been habituated to making more money.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.640]   Really, you know, there may be this desire to spend more time with your kids, but it's
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.580]   not the real reason, right?
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:52.460]   There's other reasons, whether they be habit or some sort of goal, et cetera, that we got
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.420]   to address, we got to look at and be like, "Do those reasons serve you?"
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:01.980]   - And so what would you say to someone, let's say in their mid-30s, who's got a great job
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:07.260]   and looking to do something new and feeling like the only option is to go take that next
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:11.940]   level up job that's going to be higher pay and more responsibility and probably limit
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:18.340]   their ability to have the kinds of experiences they want because they're so engulfed in work,
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:22.340]   but they're stressed out because they feel like doing anything else would be a downgrade
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.340]   in their career.
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.540]   - Well, I would just talk to them.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.540]   It's like, "What are we..."
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.180]   You know, the main thing is like, "What are we solving for?"
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.260]   And all of them, the first variable, the second variable, and the third variable, right?
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.780]   And like, how can we max them out, right?
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:36.340]   So like, they're like, "Oh, I want to actually spend time and have more fun and do X, Y,
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.340]   and Z."
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.020]   And I'd be like, "Whoa, okay.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.700]   This is one of them.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.380]   I want to be rich and I want to, you know, have..."
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.380]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.420]   "I'm going to be my own insurance agent," right?
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:51.180]   I talk about that in the book, like people try and like make basically be their own insurance
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.740]   agent by saving enough money for every single calamity, right?
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.060]   That's their backup default skew.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.300]   "Well, Jeff, what if this happens?
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.300]   What if that happens?"
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:59.300]   Right?
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:03.460]   So I try and find these things that they're actually solving for and then help them make
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:07.260]   the decision on what's the best decision for them, right?
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.820]   You know, we may come to the conclusion that taking on more responsibility now because
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:15.580]   the job pays so much damn money and then quitting in a year will actually lead to more fulfillment,
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.820]   more fun, and then I'll quit and I'll goof off and do whatever, right?
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:22.060]   The stock options are going to go into money and I'm going to make a zillion dollars and
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:27.580]   I'm going to have seven years of just bliss and goofing off as opposed to, you know, grinding
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.900]   it out five years in this lower paying job, et cetera, I'd have 100% of the time, right?
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:36.220]   But that's usually the rarity in these scenarios.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.220]   And they never quit, right?
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.220]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.220]   They never quit.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.560]   I mean, it's like you don't have to quit your job.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.720]   You just have to consume the fruits of your labor, right?
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.560]   Like you have to get everything.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.220]   You have to find your balance, right?
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:54.900]   Like you can love what you do, but you should also be able to do what you love.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.340]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.280]   And those are, you know, those are things like, you know, a lot of people like they
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.580]   went to work because they wanted a house and they wanted to have kids and they wanted to
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:08.020]   travel and they wanted to ski and they want to start a rock band or some expensive hobby
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.740]   with telescopes or whatever it is, right?
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:17.940]   And you know, somewhere along the way, those things kind of fall to the wayside.
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:26.860]   They don't exist anymore and it's the money and whatever and we kind of instinctively
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.860]   attack some sort of reason, "Oh, the kids, I'm going to spend more time on my kids."
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.580]   I'm like, "Nah, no, you don't.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.780]   That's not what you're solving for with this job, right?
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.940]   Or at least this equation doesn't compute, right?
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.460]   Like if they were my friends, like real close friends, I'm like, "No, you don't.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.460]   You're bullshitting yourself, right?
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.220]   You can lie to me, but just don't lie to yourself, right?"
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.020]   And then we go through it.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:52.780]   But you know, in a more gentle process, like let's just see if this formula computes.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.380]   Let's put it up on the board.
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.380]   Let's map out the time, like get really detailed.
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.660]   Like, okay, how much more money are you going to get?
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.660]   When are you going to have the time?
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.500]   How much more spare time are you going to have?
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.500]   When does this happen?
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:05.500]   Is your kid still a kid?
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.500]   Do they still want to hang out with you?
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.180]   Okay, what's this other job?
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:13.020]   You know, no two-hour commute, that's two hours a day you can have your kids, right?
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:17.980]   Well, it seems like, you know, if we're solving for time with the kid, right?
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.240]   This job may be better than this job, right?
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.820]   Because the money you accumulate, you really don't have the time to spend it because you're
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.900]   working harder and you have more responsibilities and it's in the future and your kid's not
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.720]   a kid anymore, right?
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.720]   And they're gone, right?
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:36.500]   And so, you know, we might come to that conclusion depending on what we put on the board.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.580]   So, like much like you do, like you're digging in, like if I switch this and I fly this plane
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.760]   and I do this on Tuesday, I get the most frequent flyer miles, right?
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.180]   Like you're optimizing for like the most miles, right?
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:50.700]   And I will look at a trip as like, yeah, miles is one of the things I'm optimizing for.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:54.980]   But ultimately, I'm optimizing for the best fucking trip and the most memory dividends
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.020]   and the most fulfillment out of this trip.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.240]   So that's number one priority and number two is the miles.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:06.280]   I'm very grateful that we had children because it's forced my perspective to be, "Oh, before
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.980]   when I was younger, if I had to take three layovers to get to South Africa, I think when
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.260]   we went to South Africa for this trip around the world, we had like five layovers because
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:16.980]   we stopped one place, then we changed planes and the plane landed in Sudan, but we couldn't
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:17.980]   even get off the plane.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.180]   So we just sat there until it took off again and all this stuff.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:24.100]   Now I'm like, how can I get there with zero to one stop?
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:28.980]   Like, you know, if it's really far, one stop, if it's really close, zero stops and that's
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.780]   forced me to reprioritize what I want.
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.580]   But I want to talk about a few things.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.720]   So how do we implement this?
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:42.460]   But maybe first, some of the common objections to changing this.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.000]   So two things you talked about.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.860]   One is preventing running out of money.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:49.700]   I think everyone I know is like, "Oh, I want to make sure I have enough.
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.180]   What if I live to 110?
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:54.180]   What if health gets so great that I'm living forever?"
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:58.080]   What do you tell to people who are trying to optimize for every possible thing that
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.140]   could happen?
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:03.700]   How to just get either comfortable with the risk that they don't need it or you even mentioned
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.340]   the book, like, just get an annuity, like, what's the…
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.340]   Right, right.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.340]   Yeah.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:11.180]   I'm like, if you're worried about running out of money, get an annuity, right?
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.540]   Get the reverse of life insurance.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.540]   Everybody gets life insurance, right?
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.780]   They're like, "I have life insurance if I die early, etc."
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.980]   Well, if you're worried about living too long, it's the exact opposite, they have an insurance
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.440]   product for that, right?
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:26.260]   Or they're worried about long-term, what if I need nurses or whatever, I'm like, long-term
[00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:29.260]   healthcare insurance is pretty cheap.
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.500]   It's actually very cheap, right?
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:36.560]   And because I think one of the reasons is when you need those nurses, you're on your
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.560]   way out.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.600]   They're not going to be paying that long, you know?
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.660]   But it's pretty cheap, particularly if you get it while you're younger, right?
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:49.780]   30s and 40s, it's actually trivial for people of the wealth category that you're talking
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:50.780]   about.
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:57.220]   So, I look at things that people are acting as an insurance agent inefficiently and I'm
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:02.460]   like, let's be more efficient on how we insure away these risks, right?
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.540]   And it might be an insurance product, etc.
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:08.100]   And some of the things that they're - let's say there's not an insurance product or whatever
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:13.660]   they're fear of, you know, I try and convert their fear of - you should fear wasting your
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:17.100]   life more than you fear running out of money, right?
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.540]   I try and redirect them to that, right?
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.060]   Like what are the things you want to have?
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.700]   What experience you want to have when this is your life, you will die, it doesn't go
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.020]   on forever, what is urgent to you?
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:32.260]   And what is urgent for each period?
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:38.120]   And so, when we have that conversation, you know, in my presence and their presence while
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.220]   I think about it, you're like, yeah, you're right.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.380]   The key is to keep them on that, right?
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.900]   Because you have that conversation, they go back and they're right back on autopilot.
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.920]   Let's go running the wheel because it's fun to run the wheel, right?
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:55.260]   No cheese, no reward, no fulfilling life, just a battery, a robot, a cog in the wheel
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.600]   for the economic system.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:05.860]   But you know, I implore them to stay focused on, always attach your efforts to what the
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.260]   goal, what the consumption is.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:13.660]   That is how I get them on the goal and in every single objection, whether it's what
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:19.580]   if I live too long, what if I need long-term care insurance, etc.
[00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:23.900]   There is a way to minimize that risk or mitigate that risk more efficiently than the way they
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:27.100]   are doing it right now because honestly, they've just been doing it on autopilot.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.340]   It's just a backstop reason to back up why they're doing it.
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.940]   You know how some behaviors, you'll just do them and then you'll throw a reason after
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:38.860]   the fact on why you're doing it and you're just doing it because it's on autopilot?
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:39.860]   That's a lot of those reasons.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.700]   Well, I'm working real hard because of whatever, what if I get sick?
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:47.780]   Like, okay, when you get sick and $20,000 a night in the hospital bed, are you really
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:48.780]   the insurance agent?
[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.380]   No, you're buying insurance for that, right?
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.100]   Like, let's really think this through.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:57.780]   And so, when you're sitting across someone, sometimes it's a lot of chalkboard work.
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:58.780]   You know what I mean?
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.180]   It's a lot of going through it and that's why I tell people like you need to sit down
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:08.460]   and think about this honestly with yourself and work through these priorities and what
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:13.660]   are your fears and like, let's go one by one to try to mitigate them because if we're solving
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:17.740]   for the most fulfilling life, everything else is secondary and everything else needs to
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:18.740]   be solved.
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:24.580]   And you talk a lot about risk, but is it sometimes that that risk is really just fear?
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:25.580]   You said it, not me.
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:26.580]   No.
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.580]   I will say it too.
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:33.500]   Yeah, it's just fucking fear and a lot of it's fear of embarrassment, fear of running
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:38.380]   out of money, like that is like the worst thing for people, not because they can't go
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:46.500]   get some basic job and survive, just the embarrassment, the status, the ego attached to it, right?
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:52.480]   And I guess why, because like if you run out of money, right, or you were at high status
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.400]   and now you're working at McDonald's say, or whatever, and you get that shame and people
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.920]   mocking you, whatever.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.340]   If you waste your life and die, nobody's mocking you.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.820]   You can't know you're dead.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:04.820]   You know?
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:08.400]   I mean, the people who are alive are like, "Wow, that fucking guy, what a clown, dude.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.860]   That guy died with $4 billion.
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:12.740]   What a fucking idiot.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:20.640]   Like he got completely habituated to be a cog in the fucking wheel.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   Great one, dude.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.000]   Thank you for your service.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.440]   Thank you for putting out all this value, getting a fraction of yourself and never using
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.440]   it.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.520]   And then donating 40% to the US Treasury.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.960]   We fucking love that guy.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.960]   And so like that doesn't, they don't hear that, they're dead, right?
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.400]   But if you somehow go start some business and it fails, people are like, "I told you
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.400]   so.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.400]   I knew it was going to happen.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.400]   Shoulda, woulda, coulda."
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.400]   Right?
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.400]   And your ego can't handle that.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.460]   So I always think it's fear.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:51.480]   And the fear is not the actual bad thing.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.080]   The fear is the ego associated with the failure.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:49:00.040]   We should almost, it would help if society put more of an emphasis on like, "Wow, you
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.440]   didn't go and spend your money.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.600]   You didn't go on a trip this year?
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.920]   You didn't do anything?
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.160]   You did nothing this year?"
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.400]   I did get close to one, I get who it was.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:17.600]   I was just talking to them, but they said, I put it to the bunch of 20-year-olds or class
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.600]   or something.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.840]   It's like, "Who would switch right now with Warren Buffett?"
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:27.080]   None of them, none of them.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.960]   And they're like, "Well, he's got X billion dollars or whatever."
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:34.280]   And it's like, they're like, "I don't want to be rich, that rich and old.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:39.480]   There's no amount of money you can give me to give up my life."
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.800]   And so a lot of people are kind of doing some version of this.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.560]   I always tell people there's no amount of money you can pay me to do five years in Sing
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.560]   Sing.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:53.000]   Maybe at 19 you could have done it, but right now, no amount of money.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.600]   And some people are doing some sort of version of jail, giving up their life for this money.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:05.760]   - Yeah, I liked how you reframed someone who wouldn't take the risk to move, to make more
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.720]   money to do something as like paying a fine, the cost, like they're paying to just sit
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.540]   still by not taking up an opportunity.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:18.600]   And so I like these mindset shifts that you introduced in the book, which is just like,
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:22.920]   think about it this different way, and maybe that'll help you get over that hurdle.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.640]   - Yeah, just quantify it.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.640]   You may come to the same decision.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.800]   Yes, I'm happy paying the fine sitting here.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   Right?
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   Or you might be like, "That's ludicrous."
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   Right?
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.560]   Like, I actually would get much more money and I would be able to spend more quality
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:39.000]   time with the people I love that I'm leaving, right, than I do right now.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.560]   I've had this conversation with people like, "Oh, I don't want to leave New York because
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:46.280]   my mom's here and so-and-so's here, etc."
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.720]   I was like, "Okay, let's break this down.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:51.360]   How many times do you see them a week, a month?
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.360]   Okay, write that down.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.360]   How many hours?
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.360]   All right, whatever.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.320]   And then, okay, what's the money difference?
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.720]   And then, what's a plane ticket back and forth?
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.200]   And then, you could probably take them on vacation and you spend more time.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:11.960]   So, in theory, you can spend more time, more quality time, make more money, expand your
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:17.640]   contact network, etc with this move, even though you're saying you don't want to move
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.120]   because of the people that are here, right?
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.000]   And sometimes that formula doesn't work out, but at least you go through the exercise and
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.120]   then you know, you don't have this like future regret, right?
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.560]   Like you have this regret minimization like, "I made the right decision.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.080]   I went through all the avenues, etc.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:38.160]   I actually get more time with my family by staying here or I've made the right decision.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:44.960]   I have more - I've actually expanded my network, have more money and actually spent more time
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:50.560]   with the people I love in a better way, in a better format, in a more fulfilling format."
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:53.040]   And so, that's a book, right?
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.040]   This is the mental model, right?
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.440]   Like, we're solving for net fulfillment.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:00.360]   Well, I did an interview, episode 40 with Dan Pink, who wrote a book about regret.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:04.360]   And he talked about like one of the big four regrets is a regret of boldness.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:08.840]   And like people in their old age are like, "I just wish when I wanted to do this thing,
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.320]   I went and did it."
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:14.040]   And I almost feel like a default assumption should be instead of when you're thinking,
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.600]   "Should I move?
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.960]   Should I go on this adventure?
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.040]   Should I do this thing?"
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.800]   Just try to every time be like, "Should I not do it?"
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.560]   Try to always assume that you're going to do this bold thing and see if you could talk
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.200]   yourself out of it instead of talk yourself into it.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:32.840]   It's like, it's not easy, but I would say when you're about to - if you're ever faced
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.320]   with this kind of tough, "Should I do this big thing?"
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.200]   Just try to say, "Okay, let's assume I do it.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.200]   Why shouldn't I do it?"
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:43.520]   And I think that could help change that mindset because I think it's hard.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.040]   One thing I did once and you did a similar one that I think was more extreme is I find
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:52.600]   that if you're ever worried about money, go find - go experience what it's like to make
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.960]   money doing something without a job.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.600]   So for me, my wife was at Lyft and I was like, "I'm just going to sign up for a Lyft driver."
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.800]   I did it for two reasons.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:07.600]   One, it was really rewarding to realize I can convert my time to money in a moment.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.360]   If I don't have a job, if I don't have anything, I can still convert it to money.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:14.440]   The second thing it was good was it just put probably too low, but it put a threshold on
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:19.400]   what my time is worth and it helped me realize that every hour I'm not driving my car around
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:24.840]   picking people up, I am spending money to not do that because I could be making money
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:25.840]   and that helped.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.840]   Right.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.160]   You went panhandling, right?
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.960]   Just to try to - a similar experience?
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:32.960]   I've done that.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.560]   That was an exercise from an emotional intelligence class and I went panhandling.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:40.240]   And it was really, really, really moving, enlightening, humbling, all these things at
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.240]   the same time.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:44.000]   One, it was like, "Oh, I can survive.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.480]   I can make $54,000 easy panhandling, right?"
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.240]   Was that the annualized?
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.240]   That was kind of the rate.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.240]   That was the kind of annualized.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.240]   I was running the rate.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.680]   I was like, you know, and I didn't even really have a sign or anything.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:54:02.480]   I just took my shirt out, put it in size out, rubbed it on the concrete, and then, you know,
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.240]   just had a cup, right, on a corner on an intersection.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.080]   And I was like, "Well, if I was at a busier intersection," you know, I was like doing
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.440]   the calculations, et cetera.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:20.480]   I was like, "I may be in a humbling situation, but I can make money just in a panhandling
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:21.480]   way."
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:22.480]   Right?
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:29.240]   And so, you know, it was also kind of freeing, right?
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.800]   But I've always had that risk mindset.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:38.880]   Like I'll always be able to exchange hours of my life for money in order to eat, you
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.240]   know, shelter myself, right?
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.200]   And I don't mean like, "Hey, I'm living high on the hog."
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.680]   I mean like I can get like these cheap-ass apartments, right, these one-bedrooms, et
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:47.680]   cetera.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.640]   I will always be able to do that.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:57.080]   And so, it liberates me to go, "There's really not that much downside," right?
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.360]   It's an ego downside, right?
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.160]   It's a humbling downside, but there's really not much downside.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:04.360]   I should be swinging for the motherfucking fences, right, even more so, right?
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.360]   Like I'm okay with it.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.860]   And the risk, you don't really need to insure yourself against the risk that you run out
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:13.440]   of money because you've now established that like just sitting on the ground can make you
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.440]   money.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:17.760]   So, like you could do that when you're young, you could do that when you're old, like if
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:23.640]   you've established that you can, maybe you're comfortable not saving to insure against every
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.400]   possible risk.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:29.160]   There's people out there who insure against these risks that you don't want to have, these
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:33.360]   bogeymen that do it for less of a cost of you wasting your life, right?
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.360]   Like they're more efficient.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:38.780]   So, you got to think, any kind of waste in your time, whether you're exchanging your
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:43.660]   time for money or your money for time, any kind of waste leads to less fulfillment.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:48.340]   And so, you really want to be like, "Hmm, am I the right person to insure myself against
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:53.100]   this calamity or should I pay an insurance agent, you know, whatever this fee is and
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.660]   that will be more efficient, result in net fulfillment for me?"
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:56:04.020]   You know, should I be - when I look at this activity or whatever, should I be exchanging
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:07.800]   hours of my life for money or should it be the other way around, right?
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:11.920]   What's an hour of my time worth at this level, at that level, etc?
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:16.600]   These are questions we ask ourselves all the time, right?
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.560]   We should be asking ourselves all the time, I say we ask ourselves all the time, right?
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:26.000]   Like, do I really - is that shirt really worth two hours of my time?
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.040]   Am I going to get two hours of fulfillment out of it?
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.040]   Does that really fulfill me?
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:32.200]   You know, that was the beauty of your money or your life is that it really connected me
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.200]   with my values.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:40.740]   It really made me think of what I want out of life, what an hour of my time, you know,
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.700]   what I'm willing to give up an hour of my life for or not.
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:49.820]   And then also hit home that I really, really, really want a value of hour of my time to
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:52.540]   be extremely high, you know, I went the other way, right?
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:54.460]   So that I didn't have to worry about it.
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:59.420]   But even after like I'd not have to worry about it, now let's say I have all these resources
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:04.140]   called wealth, and I have my health, how am I going to allocate this over my life to get
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.140]   the maximum fulfillment?
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:06.620]   You know, that was the next step.
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:10.780]   I was like, great, now I'm rich, like now what do I do?
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.780]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:12.780]   Right?
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:13.780]   Like, when should I spend it all?
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.780]   Perfect.
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:18.140]   You just teed up what I want to talk about, which is like implementing this, which I think,
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.340]   you know, I now have a lot of the mindset ideas and the frameworks on how to do this.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:27.980]   And what I left with the book thinking and you, I was like, okay, how does someone figure
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:31.140]   out based on where I'm at today?
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.820]   Am I spending like, should I be spending more money?
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.580]   Should I be spending less money?
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:39.020]   Like, how do you answer that question?
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:40.020]   It's a tricky question.
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:45.940]   The first thing I ask is like, you know, the experience that we all want for us is survival,
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:46.940]   right?
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:48.840]   So have we survived for our survival?
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:53.980]   So I introduced that concept of like, okay, when you no longer can work or etc.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.620]   Do you have enough to have the very basics, right?
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:00.700]   Like food, shelter, clothing, right?
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:02.740]   And depending on where you are, that's a different number.
[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:05.980]   And then after that, like, how do I spend my money?
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:10.920]   I try and use health as a forcing function because it is, right?
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.900]   On the allocation of spending money, right?
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:19.940]   Like, I look at my parents, my ancestors, like we literally had to kidnap my mom to
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:24.460]   take her to Scotland for her 80th birthday, right?
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.460]   It was an ordeal.
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:28.340]   She had the time of her life, but it was like an ordeal to get it.
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:31.900]   We're like, you're coming, whatever, we're getting you out here.
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:39.140]   But what I realized is that my mom does not consume much money at all.
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.180]   My grandmother did not consume much money at all.
[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:46.980]   My dad did not want to leave his apartment when coming at all and I'm realizing like
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:50.100]   the money, now, I always say I'm going to be different because I'm going to be in shape
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:53.780]   or whatever, but the reality is I'm going to be some version of that, right?
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:59:01.500]   And so, I'm like, the idea that I'm going to be, you know, having this Chronicle Cruise
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:07.420]   life at 77 to 86 is bullshit, right?
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:08.740]   I'm not going to be consuming that much.
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:15.540]   So I'm thinking, if I'm going to have parties, if I'm going to travel, if I'm going to hike
[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:19.020]   these mountains, if I'm going to do these activities, if I'm going to even just go on
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:27.380]   a walk in the park and do a seven-mile hike with my kids, a free activity, those activities
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:31.180]   belong here and I need to consume them now, right?
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:37.020]   So even the free ones have to get bucketed and I always think about that aspect of it
[00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:44.440]   and because I'm like, how do I allocate my fund once my survival is covered, right?
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:52.420]   And so, there is no perfect answer, but I do look at that, hey, my net worth should
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:59.620]   be peaking between 45 and 55 and if I'm in the peak, how does this curve go down?
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.260]   And I try and match it for me.
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:08.140]   I've been talking to these like doctors like Peter Tia and Chris Renna, etc.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:11.900]   And what I really want to know is like, what is the pace of my body deteriorating?
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.860]   What is the pace of my mind deteriorating?
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.740]   What is the pace of my lung capacity deteriorating?
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:25.140]   And then I know like, oh, you know, if you are this type of activity, your enjoyment
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:31.660]   of activity goes down linearly with this decline and your ability to do it completely cuts
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:35.420]   off once you reach this level, right?
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:40.460]   Like I read somewhere I was trying to do some research, I think it's like two watt hours
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:44.580]   per kilogram to climb a flight of stairs or something like that, like there's like formulas
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.580]   out there, right?
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.580]   Like I'm like, oh, okay.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:50.220]   So, if you need to run and play soccer and jump and play basketball, you need X watt
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:53.820]   hours per kilogram of energy, muscle and what that converts to, right?
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:01:00.060]   And then we know how many watt hours per kilogram people have as they age.
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:05.700]   And I was like, wow, this would be great to figure out where my consumption is, right?
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.540]   And that's what I was trying to build with this model, right?
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:11.540]   Like you're like, you're an optimizer and build this model and I realized this is impossible.
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.740]   There's so many goddamn inputs, right?
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.740]   So, really it comes down to a mental model, right?
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:26.020]   Of each activity like, okay, here's the straight line to the grave of spending down all my
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.020]   money.
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:32.020]   Here's kind of the curve I think it should be to get to my survival number, etc.
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:38.540]   And then when I look at my time bucketing, wait a minute, I said I would be spending
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:42.220]   less but I like riding on trains and that doesn't take any energy, but it costs a lot
[01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:43.220]   of money.
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:45.220]   So, let's change the spending in the curves like this, right?
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:49.740]   So, it's not going to necessarily always be this perfect log normal curve down to zero
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:50.740]   from your peak.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:55.100]   It could be, no, but there's trains and I want to ride trains and then down, right?
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.500]   So, each person is different.
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:02.100]   It really takes a lot of thinking, a lot of off autopilot because you have to know what
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.100]   you want, right?
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:07.260]   You have to have an idea at least, 70% of what you want, right?
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:13.660]   A lot of it's going to be discovery, hot luck and then you have to think about the whens,
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:14.660]   right?
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:16.380]   You have to be honest with yourself, right?
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:20.900]   A lot of people are like, "Oh, I'm in better shape than I was when I was 30 and 50".
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:26.220]   I'm like, well, that means you were just really out of shape at 30, you know what I mean?
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.680]   And so, that's it.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.880]   And I know that's not like the answer people want to hear.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.780]   They're like, "I want the spreadsheet and the formula and the detailed thing and I want
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.020]   to be told", right?
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:45.140]   And I present like kind of the macro top line, you know, your net fulfillment is an operation
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.580]   of your wealth, health and time.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:50.380]   And I leave it to the crowd to go and be like, "I built this kick-ass spreadsheet".
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:56.060]   - So, let me throw out my version, which is not yet a spreadsheet, but you had this formula
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:01.460]   where you're like, okay, your survival threshold is how much it's going to cost you to live
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:06.800]   one year times the number of years left to live and then deduct 70% because that money
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:09.620]   will grow and you can withdraw from it.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:16.700]   So, what I'm doing in my head is, okay, assuming you find employment that, you know, assuming
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:17.940]   you can make money, right?
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.620]   At some point, you'll stop being able to make money and then you'll live for some number
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:22.620]   of years.
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.620]   Let's call that number 20.
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.620]   Okay, so you can live for 20 years.
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:30.560]   How much does it cost you to live in one year, you know?
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:35.340]   And this is not, I think everyone always estimates the highest amount it could ever cost you
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:39.860]   and I'm going to use your standpoint of like, actually estimate low.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.580]   Many people end up saving more than they think and spending less, so it doesn't make sense
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.820]   to go to the extremes.
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:52.940]   So, let's say for the sake of math, you need $50,000, you know, to live in your old age
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:04:00.980]   for 20 years times 0.7, you know, that's $700,000, which might seem like a lot, but if you have
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:05.860]   your whole life to save that $700,000 and let it grow and compound, you know, I guess
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:11.820]   that would be a number that once you've saved an amount of money that by the time you're,
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:17.560]   let's call it 65, you will have that, then you could stop saving effectively.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.220]   I didn't even include social security and all these other things.
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:22.900]   - Right, but it's not necessarily you can stop saving.
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:25.020]   You can stop saving for survival.
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:29.860]   Now it's right, maybe you want to go on some big expensive trip when you're 75.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:30.860]   - Sure.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:31.860]   - Right?
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.860]   - Okay, okay.
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.860]   - Now we can start talking about our enjoyment, right?
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:37.500]   The things that fulfill us besides surviving, right?
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.100]   You can talk about thriving, right?
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:40.300]   We can solve for thriving.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:47.980]   - Yeah, so you could decide I want to equally distribute my enjoyment of life over my life
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:54.540]   and then your goal is as long as you're putting aside enough to get to 70,000 by the time
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:05:01.100]   you're 65 or 700,000 by the time you're 65, well then every year you could just spend
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:04.640]   all the excess on enjoyment and you'd be fine.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.380]   What that wouldn't let you do is maybe you want to take this crazy giant adventure when
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:14.000]   you're 45 or 50, you might want to save for that, but it made me think that if you've
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.140]   already saved enough that 30, 40 years from now it'll grow to be enough to kind of survive
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:26.860]   in retirement, all of the excess you can kind of maybe even think of as a separate bucket
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.700]   of all this excess is for enjoying life.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.020]   How do I want to distribute it?
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:37.660]   And separate your savings that's for living in retirement in a home, being able to feed
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:40.060]   yourself, there's that money.
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:44.160]   And I think maybe one thing that I've never really thought of until I'm speaking it out
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:50.420]   loud right now is could we separate the accounting so that my net worth, it's like in my mind
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:54.980]   I'm saving one amount of money that's savings for the future, but if we separated it out
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:58.960]   and said, okay, well here's how much you've saved and let's set that aside because you
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.140]   need it to live.
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:05.340]   Now the rest is all money you can spend however you want and you need to make sure that that
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.000]   balance also goes to zero.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.540]   The other one's probably going to go to zero because you're going to spend it in retirement,
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.140]   but that one needs to go to zero.
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:12.140]   Correct.
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.140]   I mean, that's what I do in the book.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:19.020]   If separating it out makes it easier for you to like figure out what experiences do I bring
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:23.580]   forward or which money do I bring forward and spend now and what do I push back in terms
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.900]   of just the fun bucket, right?
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:25.900]   My life is covered.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:29.060]   Let's just say you had the best pension ever, right?
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.880]   Now it's just like, where do I spend the money, right?
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:38.100]   So like you've covered your pension, that covers your survival, now it's like what fulfills
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:43.980]   you and when's the best time to consume those experiences that fulfill you.
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.500]   And it's probably not when you're retired.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:56.900]   For 99.999, many nines of people, it's absolutely not and particularly for Americans because
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:07:00.820]   we don't have the health for the activity.
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:05.820]   I went to the Japanese, I would say the curves are distinctly different in Japan than they
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:10.860]   are in America because when you go to Japan, you'll see 80s and 90s shopping, hanging out,
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:15.420]   cleaning, doing whatever, like having this very active life, hiking, doing whatever,
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.420]   all kinds of consumption, right?
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:18.420]   They're like, yeah, well, I'm going to travel.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:22.380]   I'm going to go to Australia and they'll be like, whoa, wait, you're 85 traveling by yourself
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.380]   on Australia?
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:28.900]   You know, like they can actually consume it for most American, no shot.
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:29.900]   I've seen it.
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:34.900]   I've seen people come, so many people die on cruise ships, getting out and trying to
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:38.460]   go swimming on the warm water, having heart attacks and stuff like that.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:43.500]   It's amazing when you watch it in real life, like if you just observe it, you know, and
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.860]   I'm not saying I was out there with a lab coat watching people, etc.
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:54.180]   But I've seen so many, you know, senior geared entertainment activities where it's really
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.180]   not that active.
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:59.740]   I love this idea of kind of creating a bucket that is your pension and then the rest you
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:02.100]   decide how you spend over your life.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:06.860]   And if that number is not decreasing, it sounds like by the time you're 55 that the non-pension
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:11.140]   side of it, you're probably doing something wrong or you figured out how to live much
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.580]   longer than I'm aware is possible.
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:20.100]   You either have kind of like a abnormal time bucket where there's some sort of activity
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:23.340]   in the future that costs a lot of money and that can happen, right?
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:28.380]   You can be like, I really love super yacht cruises and this is what I'm saving for.
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:31.340]   And that's really going to fill me the most, right?
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:32.340]   I don't really care about anything.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:37.100]   I really want to just play chess because my mental acuity is really stronger now.
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:39.460]   And you're going to be better at chess now and I want to win tournaments.
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:40.900]   I just want to play chess tournaments.
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.820]   And then I want to go on yacht trips later, right?
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:45.180]   And so you can be like, okay, maybe you're not consuming the most money now.
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:50.980]   But by and large, you know, the rule is it's now or it's a mistake.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.260]   You're completely fucking it up.
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.260]   You're doing life wrong.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:57.220]   And it's not just that it's now, it's that now benefits you.
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:01.620]   I want to recap what we talked about earlier, it's like doing it now will also benefit you
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.620]   later.
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:03.620]   So you kind of get...
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:06.260]   Yeah, it benefits your future self because your future self reaps the memory dividends,
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:07.260]   right?
[01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.940]   Like constantly reaps the memory dividends, the things you did in high school, the things
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:14.660]   you did in college, the trips you had, the honeymoon you had, the adventure you took,
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:20.540]   the business you started and failed, the business you started and succeeded, like all those
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:25.860]   things right now, you are reaping the dividends right now.
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:29.740]   And as I'm talking, there's probably people in the audience, "Yeah, I remember that, remember
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.740]   that."
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.740]   They're like filled, right?
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:40.260]   They were getting the same endorphins, et cetera, a piece of that fulfillment as actually
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:43.740]   doing the activity.
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:47.500]   My favorite thing on this is the Coke Pepsi experiment.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.500]   Do you know about this one?
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.500]   The blind taste test?
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:50.500]   I think it was written about.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:51.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:56.140]   Pepsi tends to win in a blind taste test, but Coke destroys them.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:00.220]   And it's because when you consume a Coke, you consume not only the Coke, but all the
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:03.060]   memories and the advertising associated with it, right?
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:07.380]   Because it was more advertised and they've done this with FMRI.
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:14.420]   And so, you literally consume the experiences when you have a Coke, your prior experiences.
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:17.660]   You literally are getting memory dividends from the commercial and the advertising and
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:20.740]   to feel good and to have a Coke and a smile and all that stuff.
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:24.900]   And years and years of that in your brain is unlocked when you consume a Coke and you
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.700]   know it's a Coke, right?
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:33.760]   And so, same thing happens with every activity you have, is you access and actually relive
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:37.020]   every single experience that you have when you recall.
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:39.820]   And so, I always say maximize positive life experiences.
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:44.740]   I think one of your memory dividend enhancements was reunions with the people you enjoyed the
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.460]   memories with.
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:52.060]   And it's funny, because I went on this crazy trip to Australia once, where we basically
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:55.340]   had a bunch of money that we were like, had to spend in seven days.
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.260]   And so, it was just kind of a wild, fun time.
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:03.700]   And every time I hang out with my friend who we went on this trip with, it's not 100% that
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:10.380]   we're there, but it's not 100% that we're there, but it's not zero.
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:14.820]   And so, I encourage people, I feel like we have a society where there were lots of family
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:18.460]   reunions and I feel like because families are way more distributed, that kind of goes
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:19.460]   down.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:23.180]   And my wife and I have been talking about whether we have like, I don't know what you
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:26.740]   call this, but we have a second wedding where you just invite all of your best friends that
[01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:27.740]   you throw.
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:28.740]   It's like what you did for your birthday.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:33.020]   It's like invite all the people you care about on some regular cadence, get to really relive
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.020]   those memories.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:38.500]   And you get all this value and you don't even have to do the things again.
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.500]   Yeah.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.020]   I was just joking recently.
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:44.220]   These dates on the calendars, these events are just excuses for us to throw parties and
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:45.220]   see each other.
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:47.420]   You know what I mean?
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:52.580]   And somebody also just said to me, work is something we do so we have an excuse to hang
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.280]   out with each other.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:57.860]   I thought that was pretty powerful and that's true to a certain extent, right?
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:59.780]   That's the people that I love my job, right?
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:01.020]   Well, you really love the people.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:05.580]   I think that's a lot why people I know in the last few years being home and not seeing
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.020]   them, they're like, "I hate my job."
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.980]   It's like, well, maybe you don't hate your job.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:12.180]   Maybe it's just the thing that you thought you loved was your job and you actually just
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.100]   love the people you're around all the time.
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:17.300]   And if you're not around them or you're just only seeing them on a screen or something
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:20.060]   and you don't have that social stuff, it feels different.
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:25.460]   I encourage people to deconstruct what is it about the job you love and has the job
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:27.560]   replaced other muscles?
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:32.060]   Have you atrophied your social muscle to go meet people and hang out and have dinner and
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:37.580]   go to lunch with people because work is the only place that you did these things, right?
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.780]   And so the thing you loved was, "Oh, wow.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.940]   I let work consume everything.
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:44.220]   I don't take vacations.
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.420]   I don't do walks in parks.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:49.500]   I'm not really to the extent that I would like to do and I've let work take it all over.
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:53.260]   It's where - it's how I met my spouse or my significant other.
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:54.900]   It's where I go figure out to go eat.
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:58.780]   It's where most of my dinner is going out on a town or business dinners or whatever.
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:02.300]   Where I go to lunch is usually close to work, etc.
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:07.380]   And those things are enjoyable, but it's not the work.
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.980]   I like going to lunch with people.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:09.980]   I like camaraderie.
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:11.700]   I like seeing these people.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.420]   I like going to fancy dinners and stuff like that, right?
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:21.140]   And so, when people retire or quit these jobs or get sitting remote, they're like, "Fuck,
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.460]   I don't know what to do with myself."
[01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:28.460]   And I'm like, it's because you've atrophied all these other muscles and you put all your
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:34.260]   time into habituating yourself and to being very good at this thing and this thing has
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.220]   been your whole life, your whole world.
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:40.860]   But it doesn't mean that that's the optimal place for you to build social relationships,
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:45.460]   to find a mate, to pick dinner spots, to pick lunch spot, right?
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:46.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.580]   It's just become the convenient place because we've...
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:53.300]   It just became the default autopilot thing to do, right?
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:57.620]   I've spent a bunch of time talking to people in the financial independence movement.
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:59.820]   People who are like, "Let's save all the money we can.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:03.020]   Let's spend nothing so that we can be financially free."
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.180]   Some want to retire early.
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:05.700]   Some just want independence.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:08.460]   What's your take on buy or fire?
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:09.740]   I have a couple of takes.
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:14.580]   One thing, I like it because one thing - the things I like about it and the things I absolutely
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:20.940]   hate, the thing I like about it is the fire movement forces you to be aware of the concept
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:22.580]   of enough.
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:28.220]   It forces you to get on autopilot, what things are important to me, what am I consuming because
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:32.580]   I really enjoy it and fulfills me and what am I consuming just because to consume it,
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:33.580]   right?
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:36.820]   Like advertising and I'm on some sort of consumption autopilot, right?
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:42.500]   It really gets them to think about their lives into totality and what the things that they
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.500]   really want to be doing.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.100]   Like, "I really want to do this for the rest of my life.
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:46.260]   I really want to do this for my life."
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:49.980]   And they use fire as a tool to get that.
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:51.780]   Things I hate about fire.
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:57.180]   One is they all follow this model of, "I'm going to work, work, work.
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:01.380]   I'm going to save up this money and I'm going to live off the interest."
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.860]   And I'm like, "What about the fucking principal?"
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:04.860]   You know what I mean?
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.140]   Like you got to spend down the principal, right?
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.700]   Just mathematically, you gave up hours.
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:14.980]   It's all about not giving your life away to money but having an enjoyable life.
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:18.380]   But like you're giving your life away to money that you're never going to spend down.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:24.780]   So it's like they need to readjust their formulas to include spending down the principal, okay?
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:34.860]   At the extreme, these guys are doing a version of autopilot and making a fatal error of not
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:38.700]   paying attention to time bucketing and the power of memory dividends.
[01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:44.420]   They're basically doing a version of, "I'm going to go to jail for 7 years or 10 years
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:51.380]   in order to be free and have a great life from 40 on," or whatever their retirement
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.380]   age is on.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.700]   Or going back to my original statement, there's no amount of money you can pay me to do five
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.100]   years in Sing Sing, right?
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:01.140]   Well, these guys are doing 10, 12-year stints in Sing Sing, right?
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:05.620]   And there are certain activities, certain expenditures that you should be having that
[01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:17.540]   only fit in that 30 to 45 bucket or 45 to that bucket and they're giving that up unconsciously
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:20.580]   for some future Shangri-La, right?
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:23.900]   And then they get to the future Shangri-La, and I'm not saying it's not great, but like,
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:29.580]   "Fuck, I really regret not doing X, Y, and Z," or, "I should have done this when grandmother
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:30.820]   was alive," you know what I mean?
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.640]   Or, "I should have done this when my kids were young and we should have went to Disney
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:38.700]   World instead of saving money to go on an extra trip now," right?
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:46.660]   So I think at the extreme, FIRE is another version of autopilot.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:54.680]   It's not really correctly solving for net fulfillment and there needs to be some adjustments.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:59.700]   - Yeah, somewhere in the middle between FIRE, but the FIRE autopilot and like the standard
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:02.860]   American autopilot is probably optimal, but...
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:05.380]   - Yeah, it's definitely great.
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:09.300]   It's just like, okay, you guys are, you know, these are people who like, they got the spreadsheet,
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.540]   they're in touch with what they want, they know the concept enough.
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.980]   And I'm like, "Guys, why are you not spending down a principle?
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.820]   Like this is craziness," you know what I mean?
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:21.860]   You're trying to get the most out of life, but you exchange 10 years of your life for
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.780]   something that you're never going to consume, right?
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:26.660]   You're just going to consume the dribs and drabs of it.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:27.660]   - I guess it's not the 4%.
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:28.660]   - Right?
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.660]   And then you're completely...
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:30.660]   - Is that like the 2% rule, maybe?
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:31.660]   I'm making it up.
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:38.140]   If you could live off the interest at 4% forever, what would you need to just not spend at all?
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:43.300]   - And I'm like, what I tell these people is that basically you're overworking.
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:48.080]   You're giving up an extra two or three years of your life because you're not including
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.500]   spending down the principle, right?
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.740]   They're overshooting.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:59.340]   And then the main thing is as though that autopilot really leads to future regret with
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:04.500]   certain experiences if they're not really conscious about what experiences belong when.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:09.980]   - Yeah, you didn't mention one criticism that I have, which is it assumes often, at least
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:15.080]   with the retire early side, that once you stop working, you don't make money.
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:20.660]   And I think most people, I'm sure there are exceptions, but most people can't just do
[01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:27.860]   nothing for 50 years, especially when those years are in your 30s and 40s and 50s and
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:28.860]   60s.
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:34.780]   So I think if you assume you're not going to work at all, then you need so much money.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:40.020]   But if you assume maybe you could work some, then it changes the calculus wildly.
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:44.260]   Like you go from needing millions and millions of dollars to maybe even hundreds of thousands
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:45.260]   of dollars.
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:52.900]   - The sledgehammer of fire is, in our culture, it's probably more needed than not the sledgehammer
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.300]   of fire, right?
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:19:01.580]   Because we have so many people just needlessly attached to things that don't serve them,
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:04.540]   that they don't even really want, right?
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:11.460]   But there's plenty of criticism of fire's autopilot and that sledgehammer and that kind
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:15.540]   of militant, I'm going to save for this and whatever.
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:20.580]   And there's these assumptions in there that are not true.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:24.700]   You pointed out that, yeah, you're probably going to work or have a side hustle or sell
[01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:28.660]   your art that you're going to make or whatever, there'll be some form of income that you could
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:31.260]   have or you will have, right?
[01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:32.260]   Not everybody, right?
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:37.980]   Because not me, I'm going backpacking and I'm not making a dime, okay, you're that guy.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:43.860]   But like, there is a version of autopilot and fire and it's dangerous, right?
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:49.580]   Because I'm talking about wasting your life, right?
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:55.300]   And when you say I'm going to grind, not consume, not go anywhere for 10 years, I'm like, that's
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:20:00.940]   a lot of fucking life or 15 years to be giving away.
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:02.900]   That's extremely dangerous, right?
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:07.340]   Like extremely, extremely, extremely dangerous in the net fulfillment game, right?
[01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:08.900]   In the not waste your life game.
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:15.060]   - Yeah, I'm much more comfortable with if there was a way to reframe it as like, you
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:20.940]   need this much money to experiment with financial independence for a period of time, which is
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:25.140]   like maybe change your job to a job that pays less, that gives you the time you want.
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:30.740]   But that number is so much smaller that you don't need to save it by giving up everything.
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:34.980]   So I'm going to challenge anyone in the audience and email me, you all, you know, just Chris
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:35.980]   at All The Hacks.
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:40.540]   If anyone wants to try to like build a model or a framework or something to try to create
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:44.660]   this middle ground, I want to see it, I want to get in the spreadsheet, I want to build
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:47.140]   the model with you and see if we can do it.
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:49.180]   - You have to take an individualistic approach though.
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:55.660]   The problem was like building a spreadsheet for just the masses is that everyone is different
[01:20:55.660 --> 01:21:00.340]   and everybody has different things that fulfill them, which means they're always going to
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:03.420]   have different spend curves, right, and different needs, right?
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:07.280]   And you'd be like, yeah, the thing you want, you really need to just bust your ass for
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.700]   two years and, you know, get it, right?
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:13.240]   Like, 'cause there's this step function and cost, right?
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:18.020]   Like the only thing I want is a trip to Mars and that ticket costs $225,000, well, okay,
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:19.620]   there's no half going to Mars, right?
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:25.500]   Like you have to get the $225,000 or whatever the price is, I'm making that up.
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:29.620]   But if it's like, I like roller skating and I like hanging out with my kids and I like
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:31.520]   whatever, and then it's like, you know, there's some middle ground, right?
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.020]   You can still roller skate, right?
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:35.700]   Let's go roller skating now, you don't have to save up all the money to go roller skating
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:36.700]   10 years from now, right?
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:40.060]   As a matter of fact, daughter's probably not going to go roller skating with you 10 years
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.980]   from now, she's got to have her own life and her own thing.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.420]   So, let's optimize, right, for that thing that fulfills you.
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:49.980]   And so, you know, you can build a model spreadsheet for like kind of like the average person,
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:56.380]   which there's no such thing as the average person, but it's very like, this is me, right?
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:01.780]   I've built out this spreadsheet, and I think the beauty of that spreadsheet that somebody
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:06.500]   builds out is not the actual formulas that I'll be able to copy and paste to my life,
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:11.240]   but the methodology of their thinking, right?
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:14.100]   It's the model that is the most powerful thing, right?
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:18.460]   You want the method of thinking, like, how do I think about this problem, right?
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:20.820]   What variables do I consider?
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:25.220]   - I think the thing we might be able to build pretty easily, so in the Wealthfront app,
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:29.020]   there's this idea of an FU number, and we call it the Financial Utopia number, just
[01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:32.580]   'cause I think we don't want to give it the full term, but the idea is once you have this
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:35.600]   amount of money, you could stop working.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:39.980]   And the number that I want to build a simple calculator for is kind of like the pension
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:46.660]   number where it's like, once you've started saving X, you've solved for the money you
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:50.200]   need to live in retirement.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:55.120]   It's not about stopping working, it's about starting to realize you now have crossed over
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:00.860]   a threshold of being on track to pay for life in retirement, basic needs, that you're now
[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:03.940]   at a point where you can start to allocate your excess.
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:07.700]   You could allocate it now, you could allocate it in the future, but I imagine that for many
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:13.700]   people, getting to the point that they're, like, maybe just maxing out their 401(k) gets
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:14.780]   them to that point.
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:18.540]   Like if you max out your 401(k) for your whole life, and I haven't done the math, but maybe
[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:26.180]   you have solved for retirement basic needs, and now you're at a point that you can figure
[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:28.060]   out what to do with all of your excess each month.
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:31.060]   Sure, you could save it so you can spend it in your 50s, you can spend it in your 30s,
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:35.180]   you could spend it in your 70s, but at least coming up with a framework to help people
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:39.180]   understand because in the Wealthfront app, we say, "Okay, this is your financial utopia
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:41.300]   number, your FU number."
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:45.660]   But it might be $5 million because if you're 30, it's the amount of money you need today
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:49.420]   to never work again and keep spending what you spend today.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.420]   But I don't know if that's helpful.
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:56.100]   I think it'd be more helpful to have a number that is, "Here is how much money you need
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:01.380]   to have saved to have retirement solved, and now all the excess that you save each month,
[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:02.380]   you could spend."
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:04.140]   That simple thing might be universal.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:07.980]   Obviously, it would need variables of how much you need to spend in retirement.
[01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:08.980]   We can make some assumptions.
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:11.340]   I think it helps get the concept across.
[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:17.780]   I would say that it's not optimal, the front load, you're saving for retirement, and then
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:21.660]   go say, "The rest of the money I make is for goofing off and allocating it."
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:25.500]   There's a split because there's still the situation.
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:29.140]   I think getting the concept across and people freeing their mind and like, "Holy shit, this
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:31.060]   money is for fun.
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:32.060]   And when do I want to have fun?
[01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:34.860]   And I'm going to allocate the fun at the right times in my life."
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:38.980]   I think that really is powerful getting that message across.
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:45.100]   What I would say is that you don't work two years for retirement and then start spending
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:46.100]   fun.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:48.860]   You work some for retirement and some goes to fun, some goes to fun, and it gets there
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:54.380]   at a certain point, particularly because of time bucketing and the fact that certain experiences
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:55.380]   belong then.
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:25:00.900]   And if you take that money and if you don't have that experience in this time period,
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:03.620]   you never have that experience.
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:07.220]   And that leads to future regret and less fulfillment.
[01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:12.220]   And so, it is not optimal to front load retirement.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.560]   It may solve some sort of fear in you, right?
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:18.020]   But to get the concept across, I think most of your audience is like, they really have
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:19.020]   retirement covered.
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:21.860]   They really have their survival number covered, right?
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:25.700]   So if they could separate that out, maybe some of the young people don't, but if you
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:28.820]   could separate that out and think, "Okay, I'm putting this into a retirement bucket.
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.580]   I'm on track to hit retirement.
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:34.540]   How do I spend my fun money and how do I allocate that throughout my life?"
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:36.580]   I think it's better than nothing, right?
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.860]   Because it's mainly getting that concept across, right?
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:40.340]   It's the way of thinking.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:45.060]   I wanted to sink in and a lot of people - the reason why we go over objections or the reason
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:51.380]   why I wrote the book, I wrote the book not as like some sort of economics book or physics
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:53.040]   book or calculus book, right?
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:57.260]   The reason why the book has stories in it is because you have to get past people's habits
[01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:59.620]   and egos, right?
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:03.540]   There's a reason why the book starts off with a death, a premature death.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:07.780]   It's because immediately your ego disappears and you think, "Yeah, I'm going to die.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.860]   How am I going to allocate the hours of my life?
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:11.100]   How am I going to spend the money?"
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:15.420]   Even though my life is longer and this guy's with two years, we have the same problem,
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:16.500]   right?
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:20.620]   And the reason why we go over objections is to get it in a way to get past your ego, the
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:26.220]   habits that you form so that you actually execute on these ideas, build on these ideas
[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:28.540]   to have a more fulfilling life, right?
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:33.380]   Like I'm out here, you probably heard me say it, I'm out here trying to save people's lives
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:37.260]   and a lot of times people are like, "What the fuck are you talking about Perkins, save
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:38.260]   people's lives?
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:42.300]   You wrote a goddamn book about you know, optimizing and net fulfillment."
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:49.700]   And I use this example of - listen, when you pull somebody drowning in a pool, they're
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:53.620]   drowning and you pull them out, give them a mouth-to-mouth and get the water out or
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:57.340]   whatever and they're like, "Oh my God, you saved my life."
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:58.740]   I'm like, "Guess what?
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.460]   They're still going to fucking die.
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:02.740]   They're just not going to die that day.
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:05.940]   They're still going to die, 100%.
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:08.380]   So, what have you given them?
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:14.500]   You've given them more choices, more time, more experience, more I love you's, more going
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.340]   to the opera, more hanging out with their grandmother.
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:20.740]   You've given them more of their life, right?
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:23.100]   More experience to have and then they ultimately die.
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:29.420]   And so, with this book, when I get you to optimize for net fulfillment, I'm giving you
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:35.140]   more choices, more trips with grandma, more going to the opera, more charities, more ski
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:36.140]   trips.
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.140]   It's the same thing.
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:38.760]   It's the same thing.
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:41.260]   And so, in my mind, I'm just going to go with that.
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:48.300]   So, I'm like a fanatic when it comes to this because I truly believe that when you optimize
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:52.460]   your life that much, just the same way you optimize by saving, you get more trips and
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:56.240]   more life, that I'm saving people's lives.
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.320]   - I've started putting some of this into place.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:02.220]   My wife and I actually had a conversation about money and we were like...
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:04.520]   My wife was like, "Oh, we should try to hit this goal."
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:05.520]   And then I was like, "No, no, no.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.580]   I've been reading this book.
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:09.100]   Why are we even trying to hit a higher goal?
[01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:10.420]   What is it even for?"
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:11.420]   And now we're like, "No, no, no.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:13.700]   We actually have a new net worth goal and it's down."
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:14.700]   You know?
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:15.700]   - Yeah.
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:16.700]   Yeah.
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:18.380]   It might be.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:19.380]   That's it.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:22.300]   - And so, that conversation is a great one to have because she might go...
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:26.100]   She might pull something out because, "This is the trip I want to go on."
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:27.100]   You know what I mean?
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:31.320]   And it's like this big expensive thing or, "I want to fly around in a G650," or whatever
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.320]   it is, right?
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.320]   And you'd be like, "Okay.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.660]   At least we've attached what we're working for."
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:37.660]   Right?
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:42.860]   A lot of people forget what they're working for, right?
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:49.580]   And if you ask them, they'll just regurgitate the autopilot answer, right?
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:53.660]   To get more money to the thing or whatever because it's like, "No, no.
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:55.100]   Stop, stop, stop.
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:57.140]   You're going to work and they're going to give you money.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.140]   What's the money for?
[01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:00.460]   Like, why do you need more money?
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:01.620]   What do you have?
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:07.340]   What can you not afford that you need to work for in order to consume?"
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:08.460]   And then we have a real conversation.
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:09.460]   - Yeah.
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:14.020]   And I think she would be the first to admit that in her mind, she was just on this path
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:17.900]   of accumulate, accumulate, and just she hadn't taken the pause to think about it.
[01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:22.740]   And then when we did, it clicked and the conversation was totally different.
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:26.640]   And I still think we need to figure out what we want to do with money and savings and spending
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.340]   and when we want to do it.
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:34.180]   But I think we've both now been like, "We're off the, let's just rack up money."
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:35.540]   That is no longer a goal.
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:36.540]   So thank you.
[01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:37.620]   - Yeah.
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:39.780]   And I want to hit a point because a lot of people are probably thinking, "Well, there's
[01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:40.780]   nothing I want to do."
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:41.780]   Right?
[01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:45.060]   Like they're listening to this and they're, "I don't want to do anything else."
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:49.500]   And the reason why you don't want to do anything else is because you've been a rat on a wheel.
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.340]   You haven't been exercising those muscles.
[01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:53.940]   You don't know how to play anymore.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:55.020]   You forgot.
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:56.020]   You do want anything.
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:01.180]   They're just buried so deep under all these routines you built to acquiring money and
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:03.200]   those muscles are so atrophied.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.540]   It's like you've never, you haven't gone to the gym for five years.
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:08.140]   You come in and you try and lift 225 pounds, right?
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:09.580]   Like it's not happening, right?
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:10.900]   Like you need to build up into it.
[01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:15.100]   You need to start small and be like, "Okay, let me think about these things I want to
[01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:16.100]   do.
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:17.100]   Do I really like that?
[01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:18.220]   Let me just go out and discover."
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:19.220]   Because life is discovery.
[01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:21.060]   You don't necessarily know everything you want to do.
[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:24.780]   You have to go out and be exposed to it, but you have only been exposed to work and making
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:29.780]   more money and climbing the career ladder and doing more deals and solving this puzzle
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:31.980]   that you've been solving that you've been addicted for.
[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:34.620]   And you haven't been working on the, "What fulfills me?
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.660]   What trips do I like?
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:36.940]   What experience do I have?
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:38.500]   How would I spend money if I had it?"
[01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.260]   You don't even think about those things, right?
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:43.260]   And so, it takes time.
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:45.820]   Don't be discouraged, right?
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:51.780]   Like you're not going to like just show up in the gym once and get in shape overnight.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:55.100]   You're not going to just quit your job and know exactly what you want to do overnight.
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:57.980]   You have to build yourself back up.
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:30:59.900]   You have to get back in touch.
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:05.700]   If I quit completely doing trading, I would, I too, and I think about this all the time,
[01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:06.700]   I would say, "Wow, I've got a lot of time.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:07.700]   I don't know what to do."
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:08.700]   You know what I mean?
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:09.700]   Like, whatever.
[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:13.700]   And you get this panic, "Oh, oh, I got to go back to work."
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:14.700]   Right?
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:15.700]   Like, you know what I mean?
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:18.220]   Like you just got thrown into the water and you forgot how to swim, right?
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:19.220]   Like, you're like, "Calm down.
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:20.220]   Calm down.
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:21.220]   Float for a little bit.
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:22.300]   Do a little strill.
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:23.420]   You'll get there."
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:25.900]   And then you'll have the more fulfilling life, right?
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:26.900]   - Awesome.
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:27.900]   Okay.
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:32.820]   Let's do a couple random things totally separate that I think maybe tie in, maybe don't, before
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:33.820]   we wrap.
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:37.380]   One, I want to just get your take, you know, you're an optimizer, you wrote a book about
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:39.460]   optimizing, me too.
[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:43.340]   Talk me through a few things that I just need someone like you to tell me why I'm being
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:44.340]   crazy.
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:49.580]   So I think one of the challenges I have with both money and, you know, you made a joke
[01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:52.980]   about a person that's accumulated millions of miles, that's me.
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:58.780]   And one of my challenges with using money, miles, currency, anything, is that I'm aware
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:02.140]   of how much more optimal it could be used, right?
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:07.380]   I know that if I really find the right trip, you know, 500,000 miles will take the whole
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:08.900]   family around the world.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:12.860]   But if I book it today for the thing I want, it's a million and I struggle.
[01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:16.940]   Or, you know, we were talking about the holidays this year, we're like, "We have time off.
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:21.860]   We don't have plans, but wow, it's four times more expensive to go on any vacation, you
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:24.540]   know, at the end of December than it is in January."
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:29.180]   We don't have the time off in January, so we're not actually going to do that.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:35.040]   But in my mind, it's like punt, you know, because it's an inoptimal use of that money.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:40.300]   My main thing for you is you're solving for max flyer miles and you're not solving for
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:42.420]   max fulfillment, right?
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:48.140]   And so what you don't realize is that max fulfillment for you costs this much and that's
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:50.940]   just the cost, right?
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:55.380]   So there's a time period where it belongs and this is the optimal time for it to happen
[01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:56.780]   and this is the purchase price.
[01:32:56.780 --> 01:33:01.140]   And you're like, "But I can do the trip at a suboptimal time at less fulfillment for
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:02.140]   500,000 miles."
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:07.880]   And I'm like, "You can do that, but realize that you're solving for spending less miles
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:11.520]   and not solving for max fulfillment, right?"
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:14.860]   And so if you're the type of guy that when you look back on your deathbed, you'll be
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:20.380]   like, "Wow, I saved all these goddamn miles," as opposed to, you know, "Holy shit, I fucked
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:24.340]   up my fulfillment in this period, in this time period when my kids were this age, when
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:28.620]   it was time for me to doing this and it misallocated my time," then go ahead, go ahead and solve
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:29.620]   for miles.
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:31.660]   - Or money in that case also, right?
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:35.260]   - Yeah, yeah, money, miles, whatever, whatever it is you're solving for, you're optimizing
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:36.260]   for miles.
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:42.060]   And I'm like, "Listen, fulfillment first, miles second."
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:46.860]   So there's gonna be some blend, but the maximum fulfillment is what we're solving for.
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:51.700]   And so, sometimes you're gonna have to vaporize the miles because that's what it costs.
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:55.900]   And lo and behold, the airlines know this.
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:34:01.100]   They know that like in Western culture, these holidays, this is when people want to fulfill
[01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:05.260]   their lives, et cetera, so we get to charge more for fulfillment.
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:09.780]   And when kids are like in finals, et cetera, we're like, there's no family trips, et cetera,
[01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:11.100]   so we can charge less, right?
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:12.860]   Like they know this, right?
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:17.620]   And this is the cost of fulfillment, like everything costs, right?
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:20.660]   And you're like, "No, no, no, no, I want to just have the lowest cost."
[01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:23.940]   And I'm like, "No, no, no, no, I want to have the highest fulfillment."
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:30.820]   So if you get back on, "I'm solving for max fulfillment with my family," I think you'll
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:35.180]   become less detached on the value of the conversion of the points.
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:39.780]   - Or I think the answer, maybe the answer is, and I'm trying to tweak it a little bit,
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:43.300]   which is sit down and say, "Look, we have two choices.
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:46.980]   And in the next X hours, days, whatever, we're going to pick one.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:52.420]   Either we actually do commit and we go book the trip in January when it's better," right?
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:53.740]   I'm not saying punt years.
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:56.940]   I'm saying either you say, "Look, we're just going to find a way to make it work at a lower
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:03.480]   price or we're just going to pay the price to go when it's convenient, but not let ourselves
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:05.180]   escape the decision."
[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:06.700]   I think that's the thing.
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:10.820]   It's like you either pay up because you want the fulfillment or you adjust life to make
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:15.340]   it work at a better price, as long as you don't not take the experience.
[01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:19.500]   - To me, it's like, trip here, trip here, trip here, trip here, trip here.
[01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:21.140]   What is the most fulfilling?
[01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:22.140]   Is it worth it?
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:24.180]   What gives me the net fulfillment, right?
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:30.100]   And it might be not the January, it might be trip here and another trip and two trips.
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:34.620]   And since they're in the same time bucket, that's actually more fulfillment, right?
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:36.060]   Two different environments, etc.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:39.260]   I mean, there's going to be a lot of variables like we'd get off the chalkboard, I'd go over
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:41.260]   with you and I'm like, "All right, you're really going to take two trips?"
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:42.620]   "Yeah, I'm really going to take two trips."
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:46.200]   And that's a million miles for two trips, but it's not over Christmas.
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.060]   How do you feel about the fulfillment score?
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:49.740]   Let's put a fulfillment score on each trip, okay?
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:51.700]   It seems to add up more than the trip over Christmas.
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:52.860]   Are we sure about that?
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:54.180]   Yeah, we're sure about that.
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:55.780]   We're not sure about that.
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:36:02.020]   We'd go through this whole exercise with your wife and talk about it and then we'd come
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:03.500]   to a decision, right?
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:08.580]   And then we would make the right decision knowing that we solve for net fulfillment,
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:10.140]   not miles, right?
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:13.020]   The miles was an input, right?
[01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:14.580]   Just like wealth, health, and time, right?
[01:36:14.580 --> 01:36:17.300]   So miles is kind of in the wealth bucket, right?
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:19.900]   That was an input to solve for net fulfillment.
[01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:24.540]   And we slid it back and forth in time like, "All right, two trips, two trips, not Christmas
[01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:26.300]   actually is better.
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:29.900]   We'll hang out at home and play board games and then go on two trips."
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:33.620]   I look forward to sending you a note saying, "We took the trip."
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.620]   Or the two trips.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:35.620]   Or the three trips.
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:36.620]   Or the two trips.
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:37.620]   Right?
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:38.620]   Whatever it works out to be.
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:39.620]   Or a trip and a half, right?
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:40.620]   I don't know.
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:41.620]   Or a trip plus an upgrade.
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:46.080]   These are the things that I don't have the right answer because the inputs matter most,
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:47.660]   but the mental model is there, right?
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:48.900]   You're thinking about it.
[01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:50.800]   The other thing I want to touch on is health.
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:57.340]   So it seems like one of the biggest opportunities to unlock a lot of this equation is to be
[01:36:57.340 --> 01:36:58.460]   healthier and live longer.
[01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:02.580]   You talked about how in Japan, people are kind of just as a society, that.
[01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:06.020]   I know you've spent a lot of time with some of these great doctors.
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:10.580]   Are there things that someone listening who doesn't get a chance to talk to Peter or Tia
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:15.660]   or something on a regular basis, is there stuff you've learned, whether it's tests
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:22.220]   to consider doing now or ways you've changed your diet or your health that people could
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:28.100]   do to kind of improve or extend the time that they can do more active things and I guess
[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:29.100]   live longer?
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:32.340]   I think I pay a lot for the last 15%, right?
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:36.700]   Like 85%, even the fanciest doctors, it's all low-hanging fruit, right?
[01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:42.740]   And the lowest hanging fruit is like, "Hey, do an activity that makes you sweat for four
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:50.020]   hours a week, maintain your weight, try not to consume added sugar, reduce all your sugars
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:54.300]   in your sugar intake, no alcohol, don't smoke."
[01:37:54.300 --> 01:38:02.140]   So, super low-hanging fruit about like not being overweight, staying in shape, not consuming
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:08.420]   added sugars, like sugar is the worst and exercise, like even if it's hiking, like hiking
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:15.380]   or walking is, you know, walking three miles a day or whatever, like or three miles four
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:16.820]   times a week, right?
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:27.100]   Or something like that, that's like, you know, amazing low-hanging fruit to make your current
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:32.100]   future experience - your current experience is better and your future experience is better,
[01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:33.100]   right?
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:38.700]   Because activity by health is the fulfillment and if your health is shitty, not only do
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:42.100]   you - either you don't get to do the activity or the activity is not as enjoyable, right?
[01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:47.580]   So, you don't get as - you know, if I go - I used to walk around like seven to 12 miles
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:50.820]   around Paris when I was there with a backpack on, right?
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:56.180]   Now, I can maybe do six or five before I'm like, "My knees kind of hurt, I don't like
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:57.180]   it anymore", right?
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:04.180]   So, I got more of Paris on a trip for the same dollar than I do now, right?
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:08.420]   And the more in shape I am, the less overweight I am, the less weight I'm carrying and force
[01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:11.600]   I'm hitting into my knees, the more enjoyable every single activity is, right?
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:18.380]   And so, I would argue and say to people like, that low-hanging fruit has such a huge yield
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:23.260]   on your fulfillment, you know, whether you're going to be able to enjoy playing with your
[01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:29.280]   kids or relatives or be around or even enjoy getting on a plane, etc. later on in life
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:37.060]   is highly correlated and highly dependent on the state of your health right now.
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:39.620]   I can't emphasize it enough and I'm not a health book, right?
[01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:40.620]   It's not a health book.
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:48.560]   I'm like, "Listen, there are tons of books, podcasts, motivational speakers, etc. on like
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:49.940]   how to be healthy".
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:56.180]   And I just say, "This vertical is uber important, make sure you address it, try and do activities
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:59.860]   that fulfill you irrespective of the health benefits".
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:02.780]   And one of the ones I found is hiking.
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:08.340]   Like going hiking with a friend, I get a great experience talking with them, seeing nature,
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:13.060]   discovering what's around me and it's also has these health benefits, cardio benefits,
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:17.500]   strength, legs, etc. that make future experiences better, right?
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:20.580]   So I get a double whammy, right?
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:25.580]   A double whammy, you know, not overeating, not doing X, Y, and Z.
[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:28.340]   And a lot of, you know, I say it's habit forming.
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:31.840]   Try and develop the habits that lead you to the goal, you know, because your motivation
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:32.980]   goes up and down, right?
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:39.260]   So develop these habits, you know, like get rid of the snacks, make them move far away,
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:40.260]   don't even buy them.
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:41.260]   Then you can't get to them.
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:45.120]   - Oh yeah, you said, if you're looking at a cookie, just be like, "Is this cookie worth
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:46.440]   an hour on the treadmill?"
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:47.440]   And then...
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:48.440]   - That's the way I do it.
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.860]   I convert all these things into like time, right?
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:55.060]   So resources that I'm fighting for, which I think at the end of the day, everybody's
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:56.060]   fighting, right?
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:57.060]   They want free time.
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:58.060]   They want time to do what they want.
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:40:59.620]   They want more time on the planet.
[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:03.100]   If I'm trying to maintain my health and my health is very important to, you know, my
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:08.300]   weight is very important to my future enjoyment, my knees, et cetera, like, "Is that cookie
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:09.860]   worth an hour on the treadmill?"
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:13.100]   Sometimes a cookie is actually worth an hour on a treadmill.
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:16.300]   If it's a nice, good chocolate chip cookie, I will be like, "I will go on the treadmill
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:17.300]   for these cookies."
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:18.300]   You know?
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:19.300]   And sometimes it's not.
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:22.860]   - But what if I push you since you said you'd answer anything, like to peel back some of
[01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:26.820]   that 15% that you've learned that I might not know?
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:30.180]   - I think diagnostics is the key, right?
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:39.420]   Like, you know, many diseases, ailments and their progression are thwarted if you find
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:41.160]   them earlier enough, right?
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:44.460]   Some of the cancers that are like always fatal, if they had a test for it and they found it
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:49.980]   early, you'd survive, right?
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:51.580]   Heart diagnostics, MRI diagnostics.
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:56.020]   So I think a lot of the wealthier people, you know, somebody once said to me, "You should
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:42:00.500]   be spending 10% of your income on your health."
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:02.940]   I was like, "That's fucking crazy.
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:04.660]   You know, I have a pretty high income or whatever."
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:05.660]   And I was like...
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:10.020]   And I thought about it and I was like, "No, and that includes like diet, you know, whether
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:15.620]   I buy prepackaged meals or have a chef, that includes doctors, diagnosis, et cetera, health
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:16.620]   plans."
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:19.160]   And I was like, "It's actually low.
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:20.160]   It's actually low.
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:21.160]   It's so important."
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:29.540]   A lot of the, you know, the secret sauce of these doctors is, you know, every quarter
[01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:33.240]   they come in and they draw like 32, 36 vials of blood, right?
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.140]   And it's like, "This is your mineral absorption.
[01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:36.140]   This is so-and-so.
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:40.600]   This is what your thyroid is doing and this is whatever and here's all the metrics and
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:41.880]   you're kind of out over here.
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:44.600]   Like you need to do Edware and here's your cholesterol."
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:51.600]   And these things, that preventative, you know, ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.360]   that is the key, right?
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:56.640]   And the prescription of like, "You need to be doing more cardio or you need to do this
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:00.440]   or you should be avoiding these foods because they inflame you," right?
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.040]   And inflammation is death, right?
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:05.560]   And so diagnostics, diagnostics, diagnostics, diagnostics.
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:10.440]   - Yeah, one of the companies that I partner with on the show is called Inside Tracker
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:16.760]   and they do like a 43 biomarker paired with genetic testing to kind of give you an analysis
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:21.200]   of both like different biomarkers and what that means, what your optimal range is adjusted
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:26.000]   for your genetics and like what your inner age is, which is like looking at all the biomarkers
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.840]   of where you should be, are you like ahead or behind?
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:31.640]   So that's one thing that's a little more accessible.
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:34.720]   I know there's some GRAIL tests for early cancer detection.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:39.760]   I know there's PRENUVO, which is like the full body MRI.
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:43.160]   So I'm actually, you know what, I'll punt on pushing on the 15% and I'm just gonna go
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:49.180]   find a doctor who I've met and we're gonna go deeper on this.
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:50.180]   So...
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:54.640]   - Yeah, you do the MRI, you look at your telomeres, they're like, "Oh, you can do a hyperbaric
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:55.640]   chamber."
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:44:00.240]   Like one of the things you can do that is out of Israeli studies, I'll go into one of
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:07.200]   the cutting edge but pain in the ass things, okay, that I actually stopped doing.
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:12.720]   You can go to hyperbaric chamber for two hours and in theory, it lengthens your telomeres,
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:15.320]   it makes you younger at the cellular level.
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:18.000]   Which means in theory, you know, you're gonna live longer 'cause your organs are not gonna
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.760]   break down at the time they're gonna break down, you can get some extension on telomeres.
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:26.320]   And it has all these other therapeutic supposed properties.
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:32.240]   So I'd have to go drive an hour to the hyperbaric chamber, I was gonna run the same experiment
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.600]   that the Israelis did, so you have to do X months of hyperbaric chambers, right?
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:40.120]   Like whatever it is, it's a lot.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:47.880]   But the place I had to go to was an hour away, I had to dive, you know, you go dive down,
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:51.200]   you dive to pressure, so it takes a while to get to pressure, then you stay at pressure
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:54.720]   for an hour or whatever the timeframe is and then you have to come out and then I gotta
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:56.640]   drive an hour back.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:02.720]   And I was like, "Okay, I'm going to get X benefit and live longer this timeframe but
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:09.760]   I'm wasting three to four hours a day, you know, traveling to this hyperbaric chamber
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:10.760]   back and forth."
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:13.680]   And I was just like, "Nope, not worth it.
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:14.680]   I'll die earlier."
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:15.680]   You know what I mean?
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:16.680]   Like, you know what I mean?
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:20.320]   I'll die a year earlier or whatever it is but like, you know, I mean, like this time
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:22.520]   is too valuable to me right now in this time bucket.
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:24.840]   So that's one, hyperbaric chambers.
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:26.800]   You know, I'll give you, I'll give you, I'll give you.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:27.800]   - Awesome.
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:30.880]   - No, it's not, I mean, if I had a hyperbaric chamber in my house and I could just like
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:34.300]   do it when I sleep, I'd be like, I would 100% do it.
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:39.600]   Like take a nap, you know, I like to sleep, rest is important, do my hyperbaric chamber,
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:40.600]   get out, et cetera.
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:44.280]   But that commute to the facility was just absolutely crushing.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:49.320]   - I feel that way about cold plunge and sauna to the extent that it's like, I should just
[01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:50.920]   get one and put it outside.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:54.520]   - The sauna, there's data on the health benefits.
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:56.240]   The cold, the studies aren't there.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:00.280]   There may be benefits and people are raving about the benefits, but the research isn't
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:01.280]   there.
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:07.400]   So a sauna is definitely, confers health benefits, longevity, less chance of a heart attack,
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.400]   yada, yada, yada, yada.
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:09.400]   The sauna's a hack.
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:15.280]   You know, there's all these like other hacks, you know what I mean, that are out there.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.280]   - That's the show.
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:22.120]   So I'm gonna totally hack the sauna, hyperbaric chamber might not be worth it, but it's out
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:23.120]   there.
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:32.840]   - Full diagnostics, MRIs, full diagnostics, MRIs, those 3D colon scanners, where they
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:35.840]   actually like scan your whole body.
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:41.480]   There's great latest and greatest imaging technology, et cetera, where, you know, they're
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:43.920]   gonna scan you and be like, oh, you got too much visceral fat.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:44.920]   You got this.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:45.920]   I can tell.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:46.920]   Like, I remember when I went there and they were like, oh, I can tell.
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:47.920]   I was like, do you smoke?
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:51.360]   And I was like, no, he's like, yeah, I can tell when I look at your liver, I can tell
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.360]   what you do.
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:57.360]   So they can tell my habits based on looking at my insides.
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:00.120]   And I was like, okay.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:03.120]   - I just wrote a newsletter about FSAs and HSAs.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:08.320]   So a lot of these health things are, one cool hack to compound it is you can put pre-tax
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:12.200]   money in from your employer and then use that for some of these health things that aren't
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.200]   covered by insurance.
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:20.600]   So we've done that for LASIK, for IVF, for blood tests, all that kind of stuff.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:25.880]   But the last thing I want to jump on is every time I talk to someone, I try to pick one
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:30.680]   place or I let them pick a place that they're pretty familiar with in the world and tell
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:35.040]   people that are headed there how to have a great day there, whether it's doing, drinking,
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:36.800]   dining, anything.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.800]   So pick a place.
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:39.560]   - I'm gonna pick St. Barts.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:41.440]   One, get prepared to spend money.
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:42.680]   It's not a cheap island.
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:43.680]   You can do it cheap.
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:48.040]   I'm sure you'll hack away and find the great Airbnb on a discount on a so-and-so or be
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.840]   a room reviewer or something like that, that gets you down there cheap.
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:53.400]   But let's say you get down there, right?
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:48:00.160]   St. Barts is what I think the perfect match of beauty and environment and commerce and
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:02.220]   fun, okay?
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:10.640]   So I would recommend either staying on Flaman's Beach, Flaman, you don't pronounce it, yes,
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:15.560]   or Grand Cul-de-Sac, like Barthélemy, or at Eden Rock.
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:16.860]   The main thing is the food.
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:23.420]   So you want to go get yourself a little moke car or something that's a convertible when
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:27.100]   you rent a car and make sure you drive around the island.
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:28.760]   It's not that far to drive around the island.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:31.400]   You can drive a little bit and check out little areas.
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:34.900]   You want to go to visit all the beaches.
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:41.580]   I think Governor Beach is probably the best beach in the world or one of the best beaches
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:46.740]   in the world, but I also enjoy St. Lene Beach, Grand Cul-de-Sac, all these places.
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:50.580]   Eating along the beach and just checking the vibe and hanging out is amazing.
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:57.540]   There's also a place called - what used to be called - at Shell Beach, there's a restaurant
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:48:58.540]   there.
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:48:59.540]   You definitely want to have lunch there.
[01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:02.900]   There's Le Tamaran, which is like kind of in this garden at night, you definitely want
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:03.900]   to eat there.
[01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:09.620]   I would say more for dinner than lunch.
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:13.660]   There's always going to be a party somewhere, someplace, right?
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:22.900]   So in Gustavia, walking around and shopping, there's Nikki Beach, there's the hotels, there's
[01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:26.880]   kite surfing, there's lounging.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:31.500]   I would say definitely visit the other hotels and have lunch on the beach, right?
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:36.580]   That's good places and then go check out the little shops.
[01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:37.580]   That is it.
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:45.460]   I think a lot of it is vibing and hiking and driving around and just finding little places
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:49.720]   and enjoying the nicest of the French culture, right?
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:53.820]   Because the French are known for being rude, but in St. Barts, it's the nicest of the French,
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:54.820]   right?
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:50:00.260]   Like you really have to - it's competitive to come work there and come be there, right?
[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:04.380]   So you don't get the rude French, you get the nice French, right?
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:08.780]   And you get French cuisine, which is amazing.
[01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:09.780]   It's very good.
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:15.420]   And you get a beautiful island and crystal blue water, crystal clear water and great
[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:20.380]   beaches and windsurfing and paddle surfing and swimming with turtles and things like
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.380]   that.
[01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:23.900]   And then you get to drive this island that has different climates where it has a dry
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:28.220]   side and a wet side.
[01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:33.300]   And there's all kinds of little experiences you can have in the island life way.
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:35.480]   I'm ready to go.
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:38.620]   So it's developed enough, but not overdeveloped.
[01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:39.620]   That's what I would say.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:40.620]   Yeah.
[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:43.500]   And that's the beauty of St. Barts and it's clean and it's safe.
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:44.500]   Sounds fantastic.
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:47.420]   The biggest drawback to St. Barts is it's expensive.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:52.420]   Well, every time there's a time for expensive trips, save for it, but spend the money on
[01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.420]   the trip.
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:54.420]   Don't die with it.
[01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:56.100]   Yeah, that's my takeaway.
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:59.460]   Any parting advice or places people should head to check you out where you're working
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:00.460]   online?
[01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:01.460]   Anything?
[01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:02.460]   Online.
[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:03.460]   I mean, wow.
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:04.460]   I'm on Instagram.
[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:08.420]   You know, I use Instagram and Instagram stories as kind of like my own life diary.
[01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:12.660]   Like this whole going back to that hack, like how can you use the memory dividend?
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:14.940]   I use my stories as my memory.
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:17.620]   They save to my phone and then get backed up to Google Cloud.
[01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:21.500]   And then I can, you know, it will show like on this day and I'll have all these little
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:25.040]   snippets and videos of like what happened on this trip or what I did.
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:27.080]   So I am Bill Perkins on Instagram.
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:29.320]   You can follow me.
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:34.240]   Sometimes it's just me and my cat or doing nothing exciting, but sometimes it's exciting.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:39.380]   If you want hot takes or chaos, you can follow me on Twitter @bp22 on Twitter.
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:40.380]   I don't recommend it.
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:42.940]   You know, sometimes it's markets.
[01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:44.520]   Sometimes it's finance advice.
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:46.940]   Sometimes it's hot political takes.
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:47.940]   I'm a libertarian.
[01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:55.140]   So, you know, everybody hates me left, the right, the, you know, sometimes it's just
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:59.580]   goofing off, but, you know, if you're in for the chaos, you can follow me on Twitter at
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:00.700]   BP 22.
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:05.420]   And I, it's a format that I like where I can actually interact with people, you know, enough,
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:06.540]   you know, talk to them, et cetera.
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:12.540]   So I think that's, it's a, it's a, I love Twitter too much.
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:13.660]   And I think that's basically it.
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:16.260]   I think LinkedIn is kind of, I really don't use LinkedIn that much.
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:20.640]   I mean, I, we have company accounts, zero book.com you didn't mention, which I want
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:21.640]   to talk about book.
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:22.640]   We were talking books.
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:26.720]   I mean, yeah, we're all where books are sold everywhere.
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:29.100]   It's on audio book and you can listen to it.
[01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:30.100]   You can read it everywhere.
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:31.100]   Direct zero book.com.
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:32.100]   You can go there.
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:35.540]   It'll, it'll list like, you know, the languages that it's sold.
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:40.480]   So it's in Spanish, it's in Polish, it's in Chinese, it's in German.
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.480]   What else is it in?
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:42.480]   It's in Japanese.
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:47.240]   And actually it's the book is most successful in Japan.
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:51.360]   It is like, it's, it's in, it's in the top 10 in three categories.
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:56.000]   It's been number one off and on in principles and ethics, which I don't know why I'm in
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000]   that category, but I am.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:04.600]   And it's like the number, I think right now it's the number 510 book in all of Japan Amazon,
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:08.160]   which if you think about how many damn books are, it's kind of incredible.
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:11.560]   And it has like a book also, which is probably, I assume, yeah, it's a foreign book and I
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:12.560]   wrote the book.
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:18.720]   But I think, you know, like Japanese culture, it's so counter to their culture.
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:20.760]   It's such a wake up call and it applies, right?
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:26.080]   Like I don't, a lot of the pushback I would have here is like, oh, there's so many people
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:29.120]   that don't have money and don't have to save, you know, they haven't even gotten their survival
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:30.120]   number yet.
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:32.120]   They need to read building wealth books, right?
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:36.480]   But in Japan, savings is a disease of it, right?
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:40.760]   And so I'm like, Hey, you guys have a disease and here's the cure for fulfilling life.
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:43.400]   The purpose is not to save, save, save, and then pass to another generation.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:44.400]   Then they save, save, save.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.400]   And then they pass to another generation.
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:47.080]   I'm like, what generation actually has fun?
[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:48.880]   You know what I mean?
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:55.480]   So I think they get more value and more controversy with respect to the way they're living their
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:56.760]   lives now.
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:59.120]   But everywhere, the book is everywhere.
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:01.400]   That's what I mean to say.
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:02.400]   I have the book.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:03.600]   I recommend the book.
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:05.040]   It's had a huge impact on me.
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:06.080]   Thanks for writing it.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:09.260]   Thank you for being here.
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:10.720]   I'm glad to be here.
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:15.120]   for hearing me blather. I'm always down to blather again if you want.
