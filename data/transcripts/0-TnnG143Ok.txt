[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   At the start of the week in episode 1510, we talked about leading someone to Christ,
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.480]   and Pastor John walked us through four treasure chests of glorious truths that we need to
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.400]   make clear to someone who wants to close with Christ, as the Puritans called it.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.560]   And today we talked to new believers, and it's an email from an anonymous listener,
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.680]   a new believer himself.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.120]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.360]   I'm overwhelmed at how much I don't know about the Bible.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.000]   I want to be knowledgeable about scripture so that it can guide me, and I can use it
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   to guide others in the future.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.560]   But there is so much.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.060]   I don't know where to begin.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.800]   If I were studying for an exam in class, I would start with a list of essential topics
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.460]   to be tested on.
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.360]   But with the Bible, I feel like the test is life, and I don't know what I need to know
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.340]   to be prepared, if that makes any sense.
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.040]   In other words, where do I start?
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.440]   What is the first and most essential thing I need to know to follow Christ by reading
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.680]   His Word?
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:11.640]   Well, my answer is probably going to be a little bit frustrating, because he's asking
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.080]   for a particular truth in the Bible, and I'm going to say, "Bible, Bible, Bible, Bible."
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:28.160]   I have never met a mature, fruitful, strong, spiritually discerning Christian who is not
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:36.660]   full of scripture and devoted to regular meditation on scripture and given to storing it in the
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.320]   heart through Bible memorization, and that's not a coincidence.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:51.600]   So what I want to do is persuade our new believing friend that it is absolutely essential, after
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:00.920]   coming to faith in Christ, to be radically, deeply, experientially, devoted, unshakably,
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:10.080]   unwaveringly persuaded that reading and meditating on and understanding and memorizing and enjoying
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.940]   scriptures is absolutely essential for the Christian life, which would include being
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:26.120]   in the Word—capital W—every day with the aim that we will meet God there, and little
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.280]   by little, the glory of his truth will fill and transform our lives.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:41.080]   And that may seem obvious to them or to others, but it isn't obvious because I know fairly
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.760]   well-along Christians who don't do this.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.900]   They don't do this, and they've been Christians for years, and they're lackadaisical.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.720]   They think it's optional because they know so much already, and they read so many other
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   books.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.720]   I don't regard that as a very good habit at all.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.720]   I think it's dangerous.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.040]   So, I have ten reasons that I believe this—ten reasons to make the Bible reading, Bible
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.000]   understanding, Bible memory essential to Christian life.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.920]   Resist feelings of self-sufficiency that say, "I don't need the Scripture every day."
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.160]   So, here are my ten reasons.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.160]   Scripture saves.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.640]   "Take heed to yourself and to your doctrine.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.880]   Hold fast, for by doing that you will save both yourself and your hearers."
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.560]   1 Timothy 4:16.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.760]   Salvation has happened to God's people.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.640]   Salvation is at this moment happening to God's people, and salvation will happen completely
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.360]   at the resurrection of God's people, and it is happening now by means.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.600]   Paul says, "Hold fast to the teaching and save yourself."
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.680]   God saves us daily by Scripture.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.240]   Number two, Scripture frees from Satan.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.080]   "You shall know the truth, and the truth will make you free."
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   John 8:32.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.000]   And the context is that Jesus is showing the Jewish leaders that though they think they
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.080]   are not slaves, you are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.080]   desires.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.480]   Satan is your enemy, young Christian.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.840]   He is a thousand times stronger than you are.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.000]   So John writes to the young believers, "I write to you, young men, because you are strong,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.160]   and the Word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one."
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.820]   This is our only hope for defeating a supernatural enemy.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.240]   Every time Jesus was tempted by the devil, he struck back with the sword of the Spirit,
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.680]   which is the Word of God, and he had it memorized, so he didn't have to carry a book in the
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.920]   wilderness.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.600]   Reason number three, Scripture imparts grace and peace.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:13.880]   May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.280]   Knowledge of God gained through Scripture is not identical with grace, but Peter says
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.720]   it is a means of grace.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:31.960]   If we want to be made peaceful and powerful through divine grace, Peter says, it happens
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.600]   in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.720]   That knowledge is found in one place—Scripture.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.080]   Number four, Scripture sanctifies.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.600]   Jesus prayed, "Father, sanctify them in the truth.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.280]   Your Word is truth."
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.040]   Sanctification is the process of becoming holy, that is, becoming more like Christ and
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.620]   like God, who is perfectly holy.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.620]   This is not optional.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:08.600]   Hebrews 12:14 says, "Pursue the holiness without which we will not see the Lord."
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.560]   We don't become perfect in this life, but we do become holy.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:20.440]   God sanctifies His people, and Jesus prays to His Father, "Sanctify them in the truth.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.440]   Your Word is truth."
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.020]   It couldn't be more plain or more important.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.840]   Number five, Scripture gives joy.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.640]   "You receive the Word," Paul says, "in much affliction to the Thessalonians, with
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.680]   the joy of the Holy Spirit," 1 Thessalonians 1:6.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:50.520]   Or Psalm 1, verse 2, "His delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.520]   day and night."
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.280]   Life without joy is unbearable.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:05.760]   The Christian life is a life of many afflictions, but in them all God sustains joy, and he does
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.920]   it by the Scriptures.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.320]   Reason number six, Scripture protects us from destructive error.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.040]   "Until we attain the unity of faith," Paul says, "and the knowledge of the Son
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.320]   of God, so that we may no longer be carried to and fro by every wind of doctrine," how
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:31.760]   do young Christians stop being leaves blown around by cultural and theological winds and
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   opinions?
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:42.200]   "The unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God," knowledge that they experience
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.080]   not as the opinion of man, but as the Word of God.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.120]   That's found in one place, the Scriptures.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.020]   Scripture is the hope of heaven.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.580]   That's number seven.
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.960]   Scripture is the hope of heaven.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.240]   And what I mean by this is that full understanding, full enjoyment of the truth of Scripture will
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.000]   be experienced only in heaven.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.320]   First Corinthians 13, 12, "Now I know in part, then I shall understand fully, even
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.840]   as I have been fully understood."
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:19.840]   The knowledge of God, all the fullness that a created being can properly comprehend and
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.760]   enjoy, the knowledge of God, will not be withheld from us indefinitely.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:33.720]   The frustrations of our present limitations of understanding and enjoyment will be removed.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:43.360]   How fitting it is then that we be ever growing now in what will be our final joy in the age
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.200]   to come.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.280]   Reason number eight.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.840]   Scripture will be resisted by some.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.840]   "The time is coming," Paul says, "when people will not endure sound teaching, but
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.520]   having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.960]   likings," 2 Timothy 4.3.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.760]   In other words, we need to know the Scriptures so that we're not taken off guard or knocked
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.680]   off balance or led away by false teachers.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:19.600]   We need to receive the Scriptures regularly, to be ready to meet those who refuse to receive
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.360]   the Scriptures.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.520]   Reason number nine.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.080]   The right handling of Scripture is approved by God.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:35.680]   Paul says in 2 Timothy 2.15, "Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved,
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.440]   a workman who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth."
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:49.600]   It is a precious thing to be assigned to do a very important task and then to find the
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.920]   master worker approving of what he's asked you to do.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:01.040]   We're all assigned in some measure to handle the word of God, and what a wonderful opportunity
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.720]   to be pleasing to the Lord.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.920]   Finally, number ten.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.480]   Scripture gives and sustains life.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:17.600]   Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600]   mouth of God."
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.560]   (Matthew 4.4)
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:29.800]   Spiritual life, eternal life, just like physical life, must be fed, not by bread, but by the
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.080]   word of God.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:38.640]   If you think that you have eternal life as a kind of vaccination against hell, which
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.880]   needs no nourishment, you don't know what spiritual life is.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:54.800]   So there are ten reasons for why young believers should resolve, with all their might, all
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:02.080]   the might that God gives them, to make reading and meditating on and understanding and memorizing
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:08.400]   the scriptures essential, non-negotiable, in their Christian life.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.560]   That is really helpful.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.520]   Thank you, Pastor John, for expressing all this and for modeling for all of us this priority
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.480]   in your own life for so many decades.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.480]   Really appreciate it.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.560]   And thank you for joining us today on the podcast.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:30.040]   For our feed, our archive, or to send us your own question, go to our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.880]   Well today in the church, we hear quite often phrases like, "Don't trust your desires,"
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.680]   or "Don't follow your heart."
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.120]   And yet, Christian hedonism calls people to follow their hearts toward the greatest and
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.200]   most lasting joy in the universe.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.040]   So do we follow our hearts, or do we not follow our hearts?
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.040]   It's a very discerning question from a listener.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.400]   It's up on Monday.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.400]   I'm Tony Reiki.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   Have a great weekend.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   Have a great weekend.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.720]   [end]
