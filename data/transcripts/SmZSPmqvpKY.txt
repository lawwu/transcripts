[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.360]   Okay, Dr. Burton Malkiel is an economist and a writer,
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.960]   most famous for his classic finance book,
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.400]   "A Random Walk Down Wall Street,"
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.920]   now in its 12th edition,
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.920]   and the new 50th year anniversary edition
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.520]   coming out in January.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.200]   Look for that.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.640]   Professor Malkiel is the Chemical Bank Chairman's
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.640]   Professor of Finance of Economics at Princeton University,
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.800]   a two-time chairman of the Economics Department there.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.120]   He is a leading proponent of the efficient market hypothesis
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.040]   and one of the original thought leaders
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.480]   that led to the creation of index funds.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.160]   Dr. Malkiel received his undergraduate and master's degree
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.080]   from Harvard University
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.640]   and his PhD from Princeton University.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.920]   So welcome, Dr. Malkiel.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.120]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.520]   - Well, I'm absolutely delighted to be here
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.720]   in this world of a lot of bad investment information
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.720]   and self-serving investment information.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.720]   It's nice to be with a group that has done nothing
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.560]   but give people really useful
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.120]   and really helpful information.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.040]   I'm also delighted to be with a group
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.040]   that is really established to preserve the legacy
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.240]   of a man who was my lifelong friend, Jack Bogle,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.080]   and who I shared a lot of wonderful memories with
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.400]   and a guy who really was the small investor's best friend.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.200]   So as Rick said, it's been 50 years,
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.840]   the 50th anniversary edition of my book is coming out.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.280]   I went back and just sort of thought
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.280]   of what its reaction was when it was first published.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.000]   And basically it made two points.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   One, that markets were reasonably efficient,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.200]   information got reflected quickly,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.640]   and with information reflected quickly,
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.440]   the tableau of market prices, not always correct,
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.120]   but was sufficiently efficient
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.800]   that the market was very, very hard to beat.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.560]   And I said at the time that people would be better off
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.040]   just buying and holding a broad-based index fund.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.520]   Whenever I used to say that, people would say,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.520]   "Yeah, but you can't buy the index."
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.640]   And I said in the first edition of the book,
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.920]   "Well, it's about time you should."
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.920]   Three years later, Jack Bogle started the first index fund.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.200]   The reaction to my book by professionals
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.680]   was uniformly negative.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.000]   Of course, investment professionals
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.680]   could beat the market.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.600]   When Jack started the first index fund,
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.520]   as I'm sure you know the history,
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.280]   they originally had hoped to do an underwriting
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.960]   of 150, actually 250 million.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.000]   The underwriters then reduced it to 150 million.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.920]   And by the time the last purchase was made,
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.920]   they sold $11 million of the index fund.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.280]   It was considered an abject failure.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.880]   It was called Bogle's Folly.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.000]   And I remember I used to joke with Jack Bogle
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.800]   that he and I were the only holders
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.080]   of that first index fund.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.960]   Well, a lot has changed over the 50 years.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.240]   Now people are complaining that there's too much indexing,
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.320]   that indexing has too much of a share of the market.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.200]   And it's just quite a difference
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.600]   from the original reaction to the ideas
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.040]   and to the first index fund.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.680]   So I am, as I say, delighted to be with you
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.600]   and will be delighted to respond
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.680]   to whatever things are on your minds.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.520]   - Well, thank you.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.280]   And we will have audiences asking some questions
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.600]   a little later, but I happen to have in front of me,
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.400]   my book, this is the original edition
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.680]   of "A Random Walk Down Wall Street."
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.880]   I have yet to get it signed by you, but soon.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.320]   Maybe at the next conference, possibly.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.960]   Anyway, and you did, you made a quote in this book.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.840]   Now 1973, I'll go even before that,
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.480]   but I do wanna make this quote
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.640]   'cause you alluded to it.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.520]   This is 1973, no index fund existed.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.880]   And in this book, on page 226, you wrote,
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.080]   "What we need is a no-load,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.240]   "minimum management fee mutual fund
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.400]   "that simply buys the hundreds of stocks,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.880]   "making up the broad stock market averages,
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.400]   "does no trading from security to security
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.760]   "in attempt to catch the winners.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.000]   "Whenever below average performance
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.120]   "on the part of any actual mutual funds is noticed,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.720]   "fund spokesmen are quick to point out
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.440]   "that you can't buy the averages.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.000]   "It's time the public could."
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.680]   That was 1973, which in my view,
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.120]   this was a huge inspiration to Jack Bogle
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.320]   when he was looking into creating the first index fund.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.520]   And you ended up on the Vanguard board.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.080]   When did you first talk with Jack Bogle about this idea?
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.960]   - Well, I actually was in Washington.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.640]   I was on the President's Council of Economic Advisors
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.520]   during the time when Jack initiated the first index fund.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.120]   And then after I left Washington,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.800]   I then joined the Vanguard board a year later.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   So I certainly can't tell you that I was right there
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.280]   at the time of the first index fund.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.160]   Although I will say that I was the chairman
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.720]   of the New Products Committee
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.200]   and a board member of the American Stock Exchange
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.840]   when the first index ETF started.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   So clearly I was around and talking about this
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.200]   for as long as I can remember.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.920]   - And we'll get to all the ETF question in a minute.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.680]   But what I also have in front of me is the 12th edition
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.720]   of "A Random Walk Down Wall Street."
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.920]   And I assume that the 50th edition
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.200]   will be the 13th edition?
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.040]   - Right.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.920]   - Okay, and very good.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.040]   Okay, so what I wanna do now
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.440]   is talk about investing with you, okay?
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.280]   Well, let me do one more Vanguard thing before we do that.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.560]   So you were now on the Vanguard board
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.520]   and indexing did not really take off right away.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.880]   I mean, it took about, what, 11 or 12 years
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.880]   before the S&P 500 fund actually accumulated
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.920]   about a billion dollars in assets
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.120]   and it wasn't a overnight success.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.360]   Can you talk about those days?
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.680]   I mean, you talk about those days,
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.000]   that 12 year period of, is this thing gonna survive?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.840]   Is it not gonna survive?
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.280]   And what was going on with Jack Bogle in these discussions
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.960]   when you were there at the time?
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:17.760]   - Well, I think good as any of you who have known Jack
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.240]   know that he was absolutely not dissuaded.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   Jack believed in this with all of his heart
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.480]   and the more people criticized him,
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.240]   the tougher he got.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.880]   He would actually put in his office
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.200]   the derogatory signs that indexing
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:53.720]   was a stupid investment strategy,
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.120]   that indexing was un-American,
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.080]   that this was Bogle's folly.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.080]   So I would say that, and again,
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.440]   the discussions I certainly had with Jack
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.160]   all the time in those early years,
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.240]   Jack was just even more convinced
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.680]   that indexing was the right way to go.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.000]   And fortunately, what has happened,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.760]   and I think this is one of the reasons
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   why indexing is so popular now,
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.680]   is that as evidence accumulated,
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.880]   people began to realize that indexing
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.080]   was not guaranteed mediocrity, as it was used to be called,
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.360]   but rather one got above average performance
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.360]   and in fact, that evidence has been absolutely clear
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:06.040]   over the entire 50 years since certainly
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.640]   I wrote "Random Walk" and the almost 50 years
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.720]   since Jack started the first index fund.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.440]   - And so even though the S&P 500 was not,
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.680]   I mean, it was a very, very slow start,
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.920]   and Jack continued to innovate,
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.920]   and you came out at Vanguard with the first bond index fund,
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.880]   which was not allowed to be called a bond index,
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.480]   if I recall at the time.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.800]   And then you--
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.920]   - Yeah, that'd be the difficulty.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.400]   It's easier to say that you could take an index,
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.000]   you could take the S&P,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   you could take what used to be the Wilshire Index,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.680]   now the Dow Wilshire Index,
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.680]   and you had a certain number of securities,
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.040]   you could cap weight them and put them into a fund.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.040]   It basically was not quite as easy to do in the bond market
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.440]   because you've got so many illiquid small bond holdings,
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.840]   and so you had to do this with a kind of algorithm
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.560]   that tried to give you as close as you could
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.640]   what the cap weighted bond market index was,
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.800]   but it wasn't the same kind of thing
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.560]   that you could do with equities.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.520]   - And the SEC would not allow that fund
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.840]   to be called a bond index fund for several years.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.880]   - Right.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.280]   But Jack continued to innovate,
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.920]   came out with a developed market fund,
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.640]   a REIT fund, and then a total international fund.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.440]   So by 1996, when he left Vanguard,
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.080]   there was a total U.S. stock market index fund,
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.160]   a total international fund,
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.200]   there was a total bond market fund,
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.440]   and there was a REIT fund.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.800]   Basically you had the four core four funds
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.840]   that Jack created,
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.640]   and then of course he stepped down for health reasons.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.680]   So he kept on innovating,
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.200]   even though at first this was not a great idea.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.120]   How long did you stay at Vanguard on the board of directors?
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.480]   - I was on the board of directors for 28 years.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.640]   - Wow.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.880]   And when did you, did you leave in the early 2000s?
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:29.800]   - I did, we did have a retirement age,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:36.120]   and even though I have been retired and still there,
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.680]   as active as I can be,
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.920]   that was the way things worked.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.920]   And I think fortunately that is changing now,
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.720]   and one realizes as the population ages
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.040]   that we've got a lot of people over 70
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.600]   who still have a lot to add to economic activity
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.160]   and intellectual activity.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.880]   - Well, I want to start talking
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.360]   about some different investments with you.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.680]   So I want to spend the rest of my time that I have
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.200]   before we start taking questions
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.280]   about your view of investments.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.040]   And I'll start out with the one that you mentioned,
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.760]   exchange-traded funds.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.240]   So Jack said exchange-traded funds were like giving gasoline
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.080]   and matches to an arsonist.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.960]   How do you feel about exchange-traded funds,
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.880]   and did you agree with them?
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.520]   - No, I would say that that was probably
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.840]   the only area where Jack and I disagreed.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.120]   Jack and I were absolutely a consonant
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.480]   on almost all of our ideas about investing,
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.920]   but ETFs were not one of them.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.800]   And the way the argument went was as follows.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.920]   You're right, he did think it was an arsonist.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.000]   I remember Jack would argue with me,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.560]   and he would say in his inimitable way,
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.820]   why would anybody want to buy the market
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.280]   at 10 o'clock in the morning
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.960]   and try to sell it at two o'clock in the afternoon?
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.480]   They'll cut their throats doing it.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.520]   And I would say to Jack,
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.240]   Jack, you don't think that's a good idea,
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.000]   and I don't think it's a good idea,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.760]   but the problem is that there are people
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.520]   who think erroneously that they can do it.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.840]   There are people who will try to do it,
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.100]   and if they do it in the context of a mutual fund,
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.240]   you could create costs for other people,
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.080]   like the holders, the buy and hold people
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.720]   in the mutual fund.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.440]   And in fact, if you had a bad bear market
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.480]   and all kinds of people sold,
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.240]   you might cause the mutual fund to have to sell securities,
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.100]   and it would create tax problems for the holders.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:04.100]   The beauty of the ETF is you don't do that
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.200]   within the mutual fund context.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.080]   You do that on the exchange,
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.880]   and in fact, the ETFs,
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.960]   when they make purchases and sales,
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.060]   this is not considered a taxable event.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.360]   It's considered part of the business operation
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.760]   to keep the net asset value
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.660]   and the market price consonant
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.660]   so that you don't get into big premiums or discounts.
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:43.440]   And so there were even certain tax advantages of ETFs.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:50.440]   And I said, look, I don't want people to go and buy
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.120]   and sell ETFs,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.120]   but for the buy and hold investor,
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.320]   this may be an even better way to do it
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.280]   than through a mutual fund.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.640]   Now, having said that, as ETFs develop,
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.520]   and you have these crazy ETFs,
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.240]   and they're narrower and narrower,
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.240]   and we've got an ETF that gives you three times the upside
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.840]   or three times the downside of the S&P,
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.640]   and they only do that for one day,
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.240]   they don't actually do that in perpetuity,
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.340]   that was all absolutely crazy.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.400]   And there, Jack and I agreed,
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.760]   but for the standard ETF,
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:40.760]   the standard S&P ETF, total stock market ETF,
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.480]   total international ETF,
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.040]   I thought it made a lot of sense.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.160]   And I think, frankly,
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.440]   Vanguard was a little slow.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.480]   I mean, it was not done until after Jack retired,
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.560]   but I think it's been highly successful,
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.680]   and I think it's been very useful
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.160]   for the individual investor.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.400]   - Well, I'm gonna go through a little bit
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.520]   of a lightning round with you,
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.400]   asking you about different investments.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.280]   Some of them you did cover in your 12th edition,
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.520]   or in previous editions of "A Random Walk Down Wall Street,"
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.600]   but we've had discussions here at the conference
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.720]   of about a lot of different types of investments,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.800]   and you haven't heard any of these discussions,
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.320]   so you don't know what people have been saying.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.600]   So we're gonna get your opinion about these investments.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.560]   Okay, are we ready?
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.520]   Okay. - I'm ready.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.360]   - You're ready, good.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.680]   Well, now there may or may not,
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.640]   we'll have to see how this goes.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.280]   How do you feel about international stock investing?
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.680]   Your positive, negative, what are your views?
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.560]   This is long-term.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.320]   - My views are positive,
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:05.480]   that in general,
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:11.400]   it has been a way to take advantage
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:17.320]   of the larger growth of some economies,
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.080]   and it's been a way to diversify
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.280]   even more than in the United States.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.760]   Now, I fully understand
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.960]   that it's got a very bad name right now,
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.440]   because international stocks and emerging market stocks
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.720]   have done very, very poorly,
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.720]   in part because of the enormous strength of the dollar,
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.000]   but I would say that as of today in particular,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.840]   where valuations in international markets
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   are well below average and well below US valuations,
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.200]   that I think some diversification
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.120]   into international stocks makes sense.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.960]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.000]   All right, the next one, real estate.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.800]   Do you consider REITs, Real Estate Investment Trust,
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.440]   to be a separate asset class
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.680]   from the rest of the equity market?
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.200]   - In some way, yes.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.720]   And I think particularly in a period
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.000]   that we are in today,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   where after many years of having inflation so low
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.640]   that we could ignore it,
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.240]   that real estate,
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.240]   which has been a slightly more dependable
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.160]   inflation hedge than equities,
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.160]   equities are a good inflation hedge,
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.400]   and it's one of the reasons
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.680]   why I don't think we want to abandon equities at all,
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   despite the fact that we've had
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.760]   some tough stock markets recently.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.960]   But I do think that real estate
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.760]   as a real asset over a hundred years,
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.400]   real estate has been a dependable inflation hedge,
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:24.080]   and I think it definitely deserves a place
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.160]   in a diversified portfolio.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.520]   - The next asset class,
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.600]   or at least a segment of an asset class,
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.960]   are Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, TIPS.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.680]   What are your feelings about TIPS?
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.600]   - For the individual investor,
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.040]   the I-bond,
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:50.320]   which is the bond that individuals
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.240]   can buy directly from the Treasury,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.240]   which have a zero base rate,
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.440]   but pay at the rate of inflation,
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   which was over 9% recently,
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.760]   the new rate is somewhat lower than that,
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.280]   but it is the most dependable
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.640]   and absolutely risk-free asset,
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.640]   and people should be buying as many I-bonds
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.520]   as they can afford and that they are allowed to do.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:38.520]   The rule now is each individual can buy $10,000 worth,
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.880]   so a couple could buy $20,000 worth.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.880]   You could also buy an extra $5,000
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.200]   with an income tax refund,
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:56.240]   and the Treasury is now considering
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:01.400]   changing the limit from $10,000 to $30,000.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.800]   This is an absolutely perfect inflation hedge.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.280]   It's the only absolutely perfect inflation hedge,
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.000]   and I think particularly today,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.480]   where we have high inflation,
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.320]   and I worry that we're not just quickly
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.960]   gonna go back to 2% inflation.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.120]   I think we're gonna have some inflation
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.720]   for a long period of time.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.000]   I think the I-bonds are a perfect investment
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.520]   for the individual investor.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.680]   - Okay, let's go on to the next topic,
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.360]   and this was having to do with something
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.400]   you did have in your book,
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   high-dividend-yielding stocks versus the market.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:54.160]   - As I think people who have followed the market know,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.360]   there was a fair amount of empirical work
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:04.440]   that suggested that stocks that are "value stocks"
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.640]   sell at low ratios to their book value,
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.880]   low price earnings multiples,
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.200]   have historically had a somewhat higher rate of return
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.600]   than other stocks.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   It's been suggested that small stocks,
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.920]   that is, small capitalization companies,
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.280]   have had higher rates of return
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.960]   than large capitalization companies.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.280]   Not because the market's necessarily inefficient,
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.080]   but rather because they are somewhat riskier,
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:51.000]   and risk and return are certainly related in markets.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.280]   We know that from hundreds of years of experience.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.840]   So what has come to pass, then,
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:04.440]   is that people have tried to make a business
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.080]   of segmenting the market,
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:14.160]   and probably the company that's best known
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.520]   for having done that is Dimensional Fund Advisors.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.240]   And for a long time,
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.160]   the Dimensional Fund Advisors portfolios
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:28.000]   did a little better than a simple index fund,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.080]   because while they were passive,
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:37.440]   and basically Gene Fama,
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.080]   who was the intellect behind it,
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.520]   believes very much in the efficiency of markets,
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.520]   but this, by tilting toward what he considered
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.760]   a little bit riskier portfolios,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.840]   you could get a little higher rate of return.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.520]   Not an inefficiency,
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.520]   just a little extra return from taking extra risk.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.080]   Well, the market seems to have,
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.040]   this is actually one of the things in the new edition
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.920]   that I've looked at very carefully,
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.000]   and certainly over the last few years,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.800]   the market seems to have caught up with this,
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.680]   and even Dimensional Fund Advisors portfolios
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:27.240]   have in fact underperformed
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.680]   some of these so-called factor fund portfolios,
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.640]   where you tilt in favor of one factor or another.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.640]   So again, it just frankly makes me think
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.440]   more and more that yeah,
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.040]   there are some new ideas under the sun,
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.760]   but once the market looks at these things,
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.760]   the good old fashioned broad-based index fund
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.840]   ought to be the core of everybody's portfolio.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.680]   - Thank you.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.240]   Let me point out a paper
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.000]   that you and Jack Vogel co-authored
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.880]   back in 2006 at the height
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.680]   of the small cap value run in the market,
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.120]   that this paper was called
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.520]   Turn on a Paradigm by John C. Vogel and Burton Malkiel,
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.040]   June 27th, 2006.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.920]   And it basically said,
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.720]   "Eugene Fama and Ken French have suggested
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.220]   "that higher returns can be generated
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.520]   "by index portfolios of stocks with small capitalizations
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.880]   "and low price to book ratios."
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.880]   These analysts, and you talked about Rob Arnott
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.240]   and some other people as well,
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.280]   these analysts have all argued
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.040]   that fundamentally weighted indexes
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.760]   represent a new paradigm for index fund investing.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.200]   Are they correct?
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.720]   We think not.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.120]   That was 15 years ago.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.300]   So you're a spot on on that one, at least so far.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.640]   All right, I got a few more,
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   and if people would like to start lining up for questions,
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.480]   please do so.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.140]   I've got a few more here.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.540]   We also talked about ESG.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:13.980]   ESG.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.620]   I know this is one of your favorite topics.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.100]   So I'm gonna ask you because I read the introduction
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.860]   that you wrote to Larry Suedro's book,
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.020]   and I found it fascinating.
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.020]   So could you tell us your views on ESG investing?
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:34.780]   - I have frankly become more and more skeptical
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:39.580]   about ESG investing.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.660]   I mean, first of all,
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.660]   it's just extraordinarily difficult
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:51.860]   to know what are good companies and what aren't.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:56.500]   Let's take a company,
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.340]   there's a public utility that burns coal,
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:06.340]   but that also has been the only public utility
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:11.380]   that has suggested that they would go
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:15.540]   to being completely carbon free by a date certain,
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.140]   and they're investing tons of money
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.780]   in solar power and wind power.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.580]   So is it a bad company because it burns coal,
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.940]   or is it a good company because they are transitioning?
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.660]   In fact, it's very hard to really know,
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:36.100]   and the people who go and do the ESG ratings
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.020]   are all over the map.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.740]   The correlations between the ESG raters
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:48.380]   are something like 0.4, 0.5.
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.060]   And just to put that in perspective,
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:55.140]   the correlations between Moody's and Standard & Poor's
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.500]   and doing bond ratings are 0.99.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:03.500]   So it's just very, very hard to know what's a good company.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.020]   Is a natural gas company a good company
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.500]   because that's the transition fuel that we need
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.940]   when we go to a more carbon free environment,
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.400]   or are they bad because it's carbon?
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.060]   It's just not possible to know.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.420]   There's a lot of so-called greenwashing
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.820]   where companies are trying to make themselves look good.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.820]   And I just really worry a lot about that.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.660]   Now, what I did in my introduction to that book
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:38.660]   is I fully understand that investing is emotional
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:45.620]   as well as simply we're trying to make
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.700]   as much money as possible.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:52.020]   And there are people who like to have the idea
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.660]   that, gee, their investments are doing fine.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.780]   Well, I say this, and this was the recommendation
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.620]   I put in my introduction.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.020]   If that's what you wanna do,
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.840]   index the core of your portfolio.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.820]   If you wanna buy a wind power company,
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:15.220]   if you wanna buy a solar panel company, go and do it,
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.980]   but you can do it with much less risk
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.020]   if the core of your portfolio is indexed.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.740]   And let me just be clear.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:28.460]   Don't think that you're going to make a higher rate
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:33.140]   of return by being green.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:38.140]   While at some point, if green investments get very popular,
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:42.420]   they could outperform for a while,
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.460]   but after they have become popular
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.860]   and there is something about them that people like
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.820]   and are willing to pay a higher price for,
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.380]   then my guess is you're gonna get lower rates of return,
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.420]   not higher rates of return.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.740]   So just be very, very careful.
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:05.340]   Don't turn up your nose at regular index funds
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.880]   and think that you can do good for humanity
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.140]   and make more money too,
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:17.140]   because if you look at a lot of those so-called green funds,
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.180]   you may be doing neither.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.120]   - I have one more question for you,
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.580]   and then we're gonna turn it over to our audience.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.700]   You co-authored a book on China in 2008
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.580]   in which you were bullish.
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.340]   Number one, are you still bullish on China
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.840]   and how do you feel about emerging markets in general?
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:42.980]   - I am less bullish on China than I was.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:51.220]   What China did when Deng Xiaoping came into power
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:57.900]   is he turned over the book on Marxist economics
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:02.780]   and allowed free enterprise.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.220]   And by allowing free enterprise,
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:11.220]   the Chinese economy grew at enormously rapid rates.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:18.740]   And I thought that that was going to continue.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.400]   Well, it has continued to some extent,
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:26.400]   but I get very troubled by the current leadership,
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.900]   which I think has turned their backs on Deng Xiaoping.
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:36.900]   And so I am less enthusiastic about China
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:45.580]   than I was, also in part,
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.260]   because since their one-child policy,
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.700]   they're aging so rapidly now
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.600]   that they look very much like economies in the West.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.600]   Now, having mentioned that,
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.820]   let me just say why I am still optimistic
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.760]   about emerging markets.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.520]   I think all of our Western economies
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.520]   are suffering from small or negative population growth
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.100]   and a lot of aging.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:20.100]   People do these statistics of the dependency ratios,
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:25.340]   the number of people of working age versus non-working age.
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.660]   I hate these statistics because the argument is
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.700]   if you're over 70,
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.680]   you might as well be put into the scrap heap
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.840]   because you're not productive.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.140]   But when you look at these things,
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:43.000]   you see that the Western world is just aging very rapidly.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.700]   And in economies like Japan,
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.860]   they are losing population.
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.160]   They are aging rapidly.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.820]   Japan is losing population.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.420]   It will lose a third of its population
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.380]   over the next 20 years.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:01.180]   And this worries me about the Western economies,
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:06.180]   whereas the young economies are the Indias, the Vietnams.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:10.560]   And I think they are gonna have more growth.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.000]   They are riskier.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.760]   They have been terrible investments recently.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.680]   They are extremely cheap now.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.840]   And I think they deserve a place
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.960]   in a well-diversified portfolio.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.300]   - Thank you. - You're welcome.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:37.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
