[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   We get emails every day from listeners who are on the brink of quitting.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.460]   Quitting jobs, quitting ministry, quitting the pastorate.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.480]   Quitting the pastorate is our focus today, but with implications for all types of quitting,
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.920]   we've addressed a question similar to the one we addressed today back in APJ 1405 in
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.960]   an episode titled "I'm Not Good at My Job.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.940]   Is the Lord Telling Me to Quit?"
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.240]   But today's question is specifically about ministry from an anonymous pastor who writes
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.240]   this.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.760]   Pastor John, "Hello, I'm an elder in a church in northern Minnesota and struggling with
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.640]   negative and passive-aggressive congregation members.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.840]   In your pastorate, how did you continue to find joy in serving people that routinely
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.280]   tell you all the bad things you're doing, but rarely ever tell you the good that you're
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.280]   doing?
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.540]   That's the season I'm in right now, and at what point does this struggle signify that
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.680]   I should step down from the pastorate?"
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:08.680]   Well, there are, I think, two very important questions in this cry for help, and I sure
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:18.760]   sympathize with the feelings of hearing mainly criticism from people you hope would say more.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.320]   One of those questions, and I'll come to it at the end, is how do you continue to find
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.920]   joy in serving people that are critical rather than encouraging?
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.080]   That's one question.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.880]   The other one is how do you discern when you should step down from the pastorate?
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.720]   Both of those are huge and painful considerations, so let's start with the second one, and then
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.520]   I'll try to get to the first one in just a minute.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.120]   I suppose you could say that what I'm suggesting here is a kind of triage for an embattled
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.120]   pastor.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.400]   In other words, what are the questions that we should ask when there is short-term or
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.120]   long-term criticism of our ministry?
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.540]   It really could apply to others as well, besides pastors who are in various kinds of callings
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:17.040]   and feel themselves barraged with critical responses to their efforts.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.400]   What are the questions that will help us know how to respond and whether the criticisms
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.560]   are an indication that we should not be serving in this place or in this way anymore?
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.160]   So first, are the criticisms true, or what parts of them are true and what parts are
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.760]   untrue or exaggerated?
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.120]   And here we're going to need not only biblically informed self-knowledge, humble self-knowledge,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.640]   which is really important in the ministry, but the wisdom of those who know us best,
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.480]   which would include our spouse, hopefully, wise colleagues that we trust who can help
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.240]   us sort through what is true and untrue about the criticisms.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.480]   Second, is the criticism serious?
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.800]   There are all kinds of tastes and opinions that are different from ours that can come
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.280]   at us as criticisms but have very little serious significance about the way we do our work.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.720]   Somebody might not like the shirt you wear or the tone of your voice when you answer
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.200]   the phone or where your wife sits in the worship service.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.160]   Oh my goodness, there are endless non-serious criticisms that we may or may not respond
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.360]   to.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.720]   For these, Charles Spurgeon, bless his heart, counseled a good blind eye and a deaf ear.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720]   I love that.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.200]   That's a great message he gave in lectures to my students, a blind eye and a deaf ear.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.720]   So valuable for pastors.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.040]   I recommend it.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.720]   Third, is the criticism longstanding?
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.120]   Was it a one-off disapproval or has it been going on for months or years?
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.160]   Now that may indicate a need for change or it may indicate a need for confronting a person
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.200]   who is divisive or unhelpfully negative.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:25.000]   Fourth, is it a criticism coming from only one disgruntled person or from a number of
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.440]   reputable church members?
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.840]   It is possible that a lot of people can see things in a wrong way.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.560]   Therefore numbers is not the only factor to take into consideration, but it is far less
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.240]   likely that the number of Christians are mistaken if there's more than one.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.080]   I mean, if it's just one person, that's one thing.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.280]   If it's many and continued, that's more serious.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.640]   So it's important to take seriously the same criticism coming from numerous sources.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:08.600]   Fifth, is it a moral issue involving right and wrong or is it an ability issue, a skill
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.160]   issue?
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.520]   Now both can be serious.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.720]   If it's a moral issue, that would bring reproach on the gospel or the church.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.120]   It needs to be dealt with and quickly.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.480]   If the criticism is that you don't have the ability to do what the church is rightly expecting
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.120]   you to do, that too can be damaging to the church and needs to be reckoned with seriously.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.560]   I'll get to that in just a minute.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:49.120]   Sixth, is what is being criticized changeable by repentance or by refocusing or refueling
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:06:01.280]   or retraining or is it rooted in a fixed but non-sinful personality trait, a deeply rooted
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.360]   native ability or inability?
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.680]   Now I'm sure there are a lot more questions that we could ask that would be helpful, but
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   it seems to me these ones are significant.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:22.360]   And I hinted in the questions themselves at the kinds of responses that you could give
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:29.800]   to the questions, but let me turn to more general responses to these kinds of questions.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:37.520]   First, if the criticisms are simply not true as confirmed by your own conscience and by
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   the wisest counselors around you, then seek reconciliation with the one who's criticizing
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.520]   you.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.280]   It goes like this in 1 Corinthians 4.12, "When reviled, we bless.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.240]   When persecuted, we endure.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.840]   When slandered, we entreat."
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:05.800]   Now sometimes that entreaty produces reconciliation and sometimes it doesn't, which is why Paul
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:14.720]   said in Romans 12.18, "If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.720]   all."
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:25.800]   Second, if the criticism is true but not serious, then admit it, develop strategies to improve
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.640]   and change.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:35.000]   You want to do your best to put no stumbling blocks in the way of the gospel, not even
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.080]   innocent stumbling blocks.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:47.040]   Third, if the criticism is true and serious, whether moral or regarding abilities, the
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:53.920]   issue should be addressed with the help of other trusted church leaders.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:01.440]   Repentance or even possibly dismissal might follow a moral failing.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.040]   Or if it's something less public, less egregious, then repentance and forgiveness may enable
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.640]   the pastor to keep going.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:19.480]   But what if the serious criticism regards the pastor's abilities and fitness for his
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.800]   calling or his particular ministry?
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:31.280]   One of the things that makes this so difficult is that we are almost always dealing with
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.200]   a matter of degrees here in fitness and abilities, not something as black or white or crystal
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   clear.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:48.400]   It's very difficult to quantify the gifts of leadership required for a church as it
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.920]   moves from one season to the next.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   It's very difficult to define whether a man's ability to communicate what the Scripture
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.720]   says is more helpful than unhelpful.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.480]   Some people get great help, others don't get help.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.840]   It's extremely difficult.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:12.480]   There's so many factors that go into making a man a fruitful shepherd of God's people.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.700]   So these decisions are never simple or easy.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:24.000]   So I would simply say, seek trusted counsel from spiritually wise people who know you
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.200]   well.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:32.280]   Take serious stock of yourself and assess your gifts and your abilities, especially
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.240]   with the help of other spiritually wise people.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:44.960]   Pray for a fresh vision for your life, either in this place and this ministry or something
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:51.580]   reconfigured here or something beyond where you are now.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.500]   Never lose heart.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:04.000]   Never forget that you were created and shaped the way you are by a wise and loving Father
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.920]   who does not intend for you to waste your life.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:14.800]   Even if it should prove that you're a square peg in a round hole, that does not mean that
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.280]   God made a mistake in making you a square peg.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.920]   Our time is almost gone and I haven't even gotten to the other question, namely, how
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:30.160]   do you continue to fight for joy in the midst of such criticisms while you're processing
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.560]   all this, doing all this triage?
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:38.840]   So let me just give quick bullet points from my experience and from the Word of how do
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.760]   you keep on fighting for joy in that kind of process.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:49.200]   Number one, confirm that the bottom of your joy is not ministry, but that your names are
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.880]   written in heaven.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.080]   That's Luke 10.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:11:01.280]   Number two, reset the love of Christ as the deeply precious, satisfying treasure of your
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.280]   life.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.880]   As Paul said in Galatians 2.20, "He loved me.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.400]   He loved me and gave himself for me."
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.960]   Number three, preach the promises of God to yourself.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:18.600]   They are all yes in Christ Jesus, 2 Corinthians 2.20.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.680]   I'll never leave you.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.680]   I'll never forsake you.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.140]   Preach that to yourself every day.
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.080]   Number four, pray for sustaining grace every day.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:35.920]   Plead the promises of God's faithfulness, 1 Thessalonians 5.24, "He will do it."
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.440]   That is, he'll sustain you to the end.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:44.600]   Number five, reach for rich old books of consolation.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:50.120]   Richard Sibbes, The Bruise Read, Jeremiah Burroughs, The Secret of Contentment, John
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.960]   Owen, The Glories of Christ.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:59.520]   Number six, receive regular exhortation from faithful brothers, Hebrews 3.13.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:05.240]   Oh, how we need encouragement from those who know our needs.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:13.160]   Seven, get the physical rest and exercise in natural beauty, in nature that you need.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:19.320]   And then eight, finally, memorize Psalm 25.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.360]   That's just about the best passage on guidance in the Bible.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.600]   "The Lord instructs sinners in the way.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.680]   He leads the humble in what is right and teaches the humble his way."
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.280]   So brother, he will guide you, whether you stay, whether you go.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.280]   He loves you.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.840]   He's your father.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.760]   He made you the way you are.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.360]   He will give you the guidance you need.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.360]   So good.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.360]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.680]   And speaking of indecisions in life, your little mention of Psalm 25 in this episode
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.960]   reminds me of APJ 973, which is titled, "I'm Paralyzed by Indecision.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.960]   What Should I Do?"
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.720]   That's APJ 973, "I'm Following God's Will."
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   And it's a great little episode on Psalm 25, one of those amazing texts on following God's
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.720]   will.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.720]   It's worth a listen if you find yourself in a decision dilemma, APJ 973.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.680]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.760]   Ask a question of your own.

[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.640]   Well we fight for spiritual delight by planning, and so we plan our 2023.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.000]   And we're going to talk about daily disciplines and planning next time.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.280]   Thanks for listening.
