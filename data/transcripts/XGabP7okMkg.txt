[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.260]   Well, there's a steady stream of questions that arrive from listeners seeking clarity
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.180]   on where Protestants differ from Roman Catholics.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.920]   And there's much to talk about, of course.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.440]   Today's question comes from a listener named Jordan.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.480]   Pastor John, hello, and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.080]   I've recently discovered that a ministry I closely associated with in the past does not
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.720]   believe that Jesus' righteousness is imputed to us, but is imparted to us.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.820]   Can you explain the difference between imputation and impartation, and how does the Bible explain
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.040]   these concepts about us in relationship to Christ?
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.560]   The Roman Catholic Church pronounced anathemous curses on the Reformers, like Luther, Calvin,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.520]   Zwingli, and their Protestant heirs like me, because the Reformers understood that the
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:04.320]   way we are justified before God is through imputation, imputation of Christ's righteousness,
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.160]   his perfection, to us through faith alone.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.880]   The language of imputation comes especially from Romans chapter 4, where Paul says, for
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.040]   example, in verses 4 and 5, "Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.800]   gift but as his due, and to the one who does not work but believes in the one who justifies
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.920]   the ungodly, his faith is counted or imputed as righteousness."
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:46.560]   Or verse 6, "David speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts or imputes righteousness
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.280]   apart from works."
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:58.040]   So the picture is that the work of Christ is the foundation or ground for our acceptance,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.640]   our forgiveness, our justification before God, and the way it is the foundation is that
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.480]   it provides a historical moment in time when God imputes our sin to the sinless Jesus on
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.440]   the cross and establishes his perfection and his righteousness with a consummating act
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.780]   of obedience so that he could impute then to us through faith that righteousness when
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.020]   we believe.
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:38.440]   So we read in 2 Corinthians 5:21, "For our sake God made Christ to be sin who knew no
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.560]   sin so that in him, in him, in union with him, we might become the righteousness of
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.680]   God."
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:56.880]   So that's the massive, unshakable, historical, once-for-all foundation and ground and basis
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:05.400]   for our justification, and the way we participate in that great exchange or substitution is
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.800]   through faith.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.480]   So Paul says in Philippians 3:8, "For Christ's sake we have suffered the loss of all things,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.520]   and count them as rubbish, in order that we might gain Christ and be found in him, be
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:32.780]   in union with him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from law, but that righteousness
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:41.280]   which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith."
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.200]   So faith is the instrument or the means through which God unites us to Christ.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:56.360]   Paul's words are "be found in him," so that in him, in union with him, through faith,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.760]   his righteousness is counted or imputed as being ours, though it's not ours in the
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:11.400]   sense that we performed it or that we have become intrinsically good or virtuous or righteous.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:20.000]   So the imputation is the work of God through faith by which we are declared or counted
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.760]   or imputed righteous because of Christ's blood and righteousness.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:35.480]   He bore our punishment and provided our righteousness, and we get in on that by imputation through
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.480]   faith.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.640]   And this happens in the twinkling of an eye.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.280]   When God creates saving faith in the fallen human heart, in that instant the believer
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.960]   is united to Christ, and all the benefits of Christ are counted as his.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:01.000]   He has accepted us and loved us and forgiven us and counted us righteous so that we're
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.600]   legally adopted into his family, secured forever, as he says in Romans 8, 30, "Those whom he
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.920]   justified he glorified."
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.480]   It's as good as done.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:19.040]   If you're justified in the twinkling of an eye, you are as good as glorified in the last day.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:26.560]   God will see to it that you maintain the faith and enjoy the benefits of union with Christ forever.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.840]   Now one of the reasons that the Roman Catholic Church rejected this understanding of the
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.440]   Bible, this understanding of justification by faith alone through imputation, is that
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.240]   it seemed to them to lead to lawlessness.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.200]   If Christ's righteousness is imputed to us by faith alone, why should we pursue a daily
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.160]   practical righteous life, a holy life?
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.720]   And the way the Roman Catholic Church conceived of justification to prevent that lawlessness
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:06.560]   was to conceive of justification and sanctification, the becoming of practical holiness, justification
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.360]   and sanctification as virtually the same.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.760]   So here's what the Council of Trent, the Roman Catholic Council of Trent, said, "Justification
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.640]   is not remission of sins merely but the sanctification."
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.680]   Let me say that again.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:33.840]   Justification is sanctification and renewal of the inward man through the voluntary reception
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.840]   of grace.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:43.640]   In other words, justification is not the imputation of Christ's righteousness, but the impartation—and
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.840]   here's why this is such a big deal and why those two words matter hugely—the Roman
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:56.040]   Catholic Church would say that justification is the impartation of goodness or righteousness
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.360]   or holiness.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:04.560]   It is a gift, but it is a real human virtue, a real obedience, a real transformation, a
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.200]   real sanctification.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:14.720]   Justification is not a legal transaction; it is a moral transformation.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.320]   And in view of what we've seen, I agree with the Reformers that this is not what the
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.800]   New Testament teaches that justification is.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:33.600]   Romans 5:19, "As by one man's disobedience the many were appointed sinners, counted sinners,
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.240]   sin imputed to them."
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:45.240]   So by one man's obedience, Christ's, the many will be appointed righteous.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.840]   Now, besides being contrary to the Bible, there are two other problems with treating
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:08:00.600]   justification and sanctification as the same, or treating justification as the impartation
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:06.800]   of righteousness instead of treating it as the imputation of righteousness.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:14.920]   And one is, one of the problems is that if you do that, it destroys the New Testament
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:21.000]   way of life, the New Testament way of pursuing sanctification, the gospel way of pursuing,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.360]   the confident, hope-filled way of pursuing sanctification.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:34.000]   In the New Testament, by grace, through faith, in an instant, our sins are forgiven.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.720]   We're accepted by God, we're counted righteous, we are secure in an instant.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:48.440]   And on the basis of that new standing with God, secure forever, now, on the basis of
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:56.000]   that, with that footing, with that ground under our feet, we fight sin and pursue holiness
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.440]   as those who are already accepted, already secured, already perfected.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.360]   Listen to two texts.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.400]   Here's 1 Corinthians 5, 7.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.680]   "Cleanse out the old leaven," picturing sin as leaven in a lump of dough.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:20.120]   "Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you really are unleavened."
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.640]   That whole dynamic of Christian living is destroyed.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:33.280]   If justification is the becoming of having all the sin taken out of us already, we are
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.720]   supposed to get the leaven of sin out of us, so it must be there in a practical sense,
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.120]   because we are unleavened.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.400]   That is, we are counted as having no leaven.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:49.280]   Or let me say it even differently and better, maybe from Hebrews 10, 14.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:58.240]   "For by a single offering," namely Christ's, "he has perfected for all time those who are
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.440]   being sanctified."
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.400]   Amazing!
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:13.040]   In other words, you are now being sanctified, that is, practically being made holy or perfect,
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:20.040]   and that is an evidence that by a single offering you're already perfect.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.720]   Study 1 Corinthians 5, 7 and Hebrews 10, 14.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:31.080]   So that whole way of life, fighting sin and pursuing holiness on the basis of an already
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:40.600]   being accepted, loved, holy, righteous, secure—that whole way of living is undermined by replacing
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.980]   imputation with impartation.
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.320]   So this is no small thing.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.880]   This is a very, very, very big deal.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.480]   The Reformers didn't risk their lives for nothing.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:59.040]   And the last thing I would say that makes it a big deal is that the glory of Christ
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:11.120]   is diminished when impartation replaces imputation, because that view does not honor Christ as
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:19.320]   having achieved a justifying righteousness that provides for the complete acquittal and
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:26.040]   vindication of all God's people in the instant they believe.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.920]   And that is a glorious truth to be sacrificed or lost.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.920]   Amen.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.840]   These conversations are not debates over mere semantics.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.520]   These are matters weighty and significant and relevant to everyone.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:10.600]   Well, it seems that we see signs and wonders and miracles all over our Bibles.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.080]   But for many of us, we see an absence of signs, wonders, and miracles in our own lives and
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.160]   in the world around us.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.400]   Why?
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.040]   Where did all the wonders go?
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.440]   That's the question on the table when we return on Monday.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.640]   I'm really looking forward to that one.
