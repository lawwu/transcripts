[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Welcome back to the podcast on this Monday.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Last time we were together, you told us, Pastor John, that God enlists us in His service,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   which means He calls us to have a part in accomplishing His purposes, not in meeting His needs.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Yeah, that's really key. He uses us, and in using us, we meet no need in God.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   If that's true, then comes the question, what do we do with all the texts that talk about what we give to God?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   That's the dilemma in the mind of a listener named Jeff, thinking about Sunday mornings.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Jeff writes, "You have taught that we are to come to corporate worship gatherings hungry,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   to receive, not to give to God as if He needed anything." That's Acts 17.25.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Yet there are other passages related to corporate worship that clearly use the language of giving.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Like, "Let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise, the fruit of lips that acknowledge His name."
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   That's Hebrews 13.15.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Or, "Bring an offering to Him." That's Psalm 96.8.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Or, "Give thanks to Him, bless His name." That's Psalm 100, verse 4.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   How do you harmonize these two seemingly opposite perspectives on our role in corporate worship?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   What do we give to God?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   It's true that I have said very often that I think pastors make a mistake if they scold their people
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   for coming to worship to get rather than to give.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   That's a mistake. They shouldn't do that.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   If I hear a pastor say, "If you people would just come to give to God rather than get from God,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   we would have meaningful worship services," I think that's a serious mistake.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   In fact, I don't hear that so much anymore, which makes me happy.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Now, I do suspect that such a pastoral rebuke is really on to something true.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   People can come to worship to get the wrong thing.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   They can come to get seen for their new outfit.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It used to happen on Easter at the church I grew up in.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   They can come to appear moral in the community as an upstanding churchgoer.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   They can come to merely see their friends.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   They can come to merely take their children to get some moral instruction.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   They can come in the hopes that their marriage will get better.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And pastors sense this wrong coming to get, and they know it's not healthy.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   My people are coming to get all the wrong things.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   But when the pastor diagnoses this problem as a disease of wanting to receive
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   instead of wanting to give, that's the mistake.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   It's not a disease to want to receive in worship.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I have argued that the very essence of worship,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   not just the outward acts of worship, but the inward essence of worship,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   is being satisfied in all that God is for us in Jesus.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Therefore, the way people should come to worship, if I'm right,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   is to come hungry to be satisfied in God,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   to see God more clearly, to taste God more sweetly,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   to be amazed at the way God is,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and to feel the admiration and the wonder of His greatness,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   and to feel the hopefulness and thankfulness and confidence of heart welling up
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   because of the bounty of His grace.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   All that is a way of getting, not giving.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And the right posture of that kind of getting is a sense of hunger and neediness
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   and desperation and longing and praying for more of God, more of Christ,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   more of grace, more power.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   That's the kind of getting I'm talking about.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And my point is that when we assume that kind of needy, expectant, Godward posture,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   God gets glory, not us.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And that's the essence of worship.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And worship services and preaching should aim to awaken and satisfy
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   that kind of God hunger, that kind of God getting.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   But Jeff is right to ask if I am contradicting the biblical language
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   of giving to God in worship.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Of course, I don't want to do that.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I don't want to contradict the Bible.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I love the Bible.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I believe the Bible.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I'm getting all this from the Bible.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   If we read our English Bibles, we will see give praise to God, Joshua 7:19.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Give thanks to God, Psalm 75, 1.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Bless God, Psalm 103.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Give glory to God, Romans 4, 20.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Give power to God, Psalm 68, 34.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Offer sacrifices to God, Hebrews 13, 15.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I know these texts are in the Bible.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I love them.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I aim to obey them.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And I don't think they contradict what I just said about the essence of worship
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   being satisfied in all that God is for us and coming to worship services
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   hungry to get more of God.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   So here are five quick observations to support this claim that that's
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   not a contradiction.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Number one, now this is just a pointer.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   It's not a kind of absolute statement about the use of giving language in worship.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   If you look up all the uses of the word give, which I did to get ready for this,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   the Hebrew word natan, super common word for give in a hundred contexts.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   If you look up all the uses for the word natan or give in the Psalms,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   there are 95 uses of the word give.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Only three refer to giving to God.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Two deny that we should.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Two of those three.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   No one can give the price of his life, Psalm 49, 8.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   You will not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I'd give it, Psalm 51, 18.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   The single one other text says, "Give power to God, whose majesty is over Israel."
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Virtually all other places in the Psalms where we read in English
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   that we should give to God praise or give to God thanks,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   the Hebrew has no word for give.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's just the word praise and the word thank.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   We use the word give and so create the problem for ourselves.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   None of that says we should not use the language of giving to God.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I don't want to go that far at all, but it should be a caution
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   that maybe the Psalm writers were jealous not to put God in the position
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   of being the main receiver in worship rather than the main giver in worship,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   since the giver gets the glory.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   That's number one.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Number two, that text, by the way, back in Psalm 68, 34, that says,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   "Give God power, give power to God," is translated in the ESV,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   "Ascribe power to God."
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And surely that is right.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   So I think what we ought to mean when we speak of giving God glory
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   or giving honor or giving strength or giving wisdom or giving power
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   is that we are ascribing those things to God, not adding anything to God.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   We are, in essence, receiving those things as gifts for us to enjoy
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   and echoing back to God our admiration and enjoyment
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   that we call "give God glory."
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Number three, the Bible teaches that all our gifts to God,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   whether ourselves or our resources, our praises or our thanks,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   are already God's, and He Himself is giving us the willingness
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   and the ability to give Him what is His.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   1 Chronicles 29, 14, "When the people of Israel gave generously,"
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   David says--I remember I used to use this over and over
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   when I was a pastor to try to encourage the right kind of giving to the church.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Here's what he says, "But who am I and what is my people
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   that we should be able thus to offer willingly?"
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   In other words, the willingness was a gift.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   "For all things come from you, and of your own we have given you."
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Now, that means that both the thing given and the act of giving
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   are gifts to us.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Number four, Paul says in Romans 11, 35,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   "Who has given a gift to God that he should be repaid?"
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Of course, the answer is nobody.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And then he gives the reason, verse 36,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   "For from him and through him and to him are all things;
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   to him be glory forever and ever."
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   In other words, the Bible really wants to discourage us
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   from thinking of ourselves as originating any gift to God.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   We are always receivers, even in our giving,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   and we should love to have it so.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Finally, number five, C.S. Lewis expresses why it is
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   that our giving in worship is really a getting.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Our giving praise to God is really getting joy in God.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Here's this famous quote that I've quoted,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I don't know how many times, I love it.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   "The psalmists," Lewis says, "in telling everyone to praise God
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   are doing what all men do when they speak of what they care about.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   My whole more general difficulty about the praise of God
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   depended on my absurdly denying to us,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   as regards to the supremely valuable, what we delight to do,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   what indeed we can't help doing about everything else we value.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I think we delight to praise what we enjoy
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   because the praise not merely expresses
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   but completes the enjoyment."
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   That's the key right there, John Piper talking.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   That's the key. Okay, here's Lewis again.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   "It is, it's appointed," so the praise is
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   the joy's appointed consummation.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   It is not out of compliment that lovers keep on telling one another
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   how beautiful they are.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   The delight is incomplete till it is expressed."
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   So I end where we started.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Yes, we come to worship to give praise to God,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   but the essence of that praise is being satisfied
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   in all that God is for us in worship,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   and the overflow in outward acts is the completion of the joy,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   joy in God, which is a gift from God to us.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Yeah, our giving praise to God is really getting joy in God.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   That's a remarkably profound point about praising him
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   and how his glory and our joy are bound together,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   profoundly bound together,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   which is what we're all about as Christian hedonists.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And speaking of praise, how do we authentically praise others?
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   That's up next time. I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   We'll see you back here on Thursday. See you then.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   [end]
