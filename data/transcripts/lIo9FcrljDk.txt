[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.880]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.840]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.080]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.440]   Today's podcast episode is all about sleep.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.420]   We're also going to talk about the mirror image of sleep,
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.200]   which is wakefulness.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.560]   Now, these two phases of our life, sleep and wakefulness,
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.960]   govern everything about our mental and physical health.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.540]   And we're not just gonna talk about
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.540]   what's useful about sleep.
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.520]   We're also gonna talk about how to get better at sleeping,
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.240]   and that will include how to get better at falling asleep,
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.320]   timing your sleep, and accessing better sleep quality.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.000]   In doing so, we're also gonna discuss
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   how to get more focused and alert in wakefulness.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.320]   So if you're like most people, which includes me,
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.160]   you have some challenges with sleep,
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.520]   at least every third or fifth night or so,
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.120]   and maybe even more often.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.000]   So we're really gonna go tool heavy today
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.440]   and talk about tools that can help you fall asleep,
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.020]   sleep better, and emerge from sleep feeling more rested.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.560]   So what determines how well we sleep
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.700]   and the quality of our wakeful state?
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.200]   Turns out that's governed by two forces.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.840]   The first force is a chemical force.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.120]   It's called adenosine.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.380]   Adenosine is a molecule in our nervous system and body
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.260]   that builds up the longer we are awake.
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.120]   So if you've just slept for eight or nine
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.920]   or 10 really deep restful hours,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.380]   adenosine is gonna be very low in your brain and body.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.440]   If however, you've been awake for 10, 15 or more hours,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.200]   adenosine levels are going to be much higher.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.840]   Adenosine creates a sort of sleep drive or a sleep hunger.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.080]   And a good way to remember this and think about adenosine
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.540]   is to think about caffeine.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.440]   Caffeine for most people wakes them up.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.640]   It makes them feel more alert.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.240]   Caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.200]   What that means is that when you ingest caffeine,
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.380]   whether or not it's coffee or soda or tea
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.720]   or in any other form, it binds to the adenosine receptor.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.140]   It sort of parks there just like a car would park
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.440]   in a given parking slot.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.900]   And therefore adenosine can't park in that slot.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.180]   Now, when caffeine parks in the adenosine receptor slot,
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.080]   nothing really happens downstream of that receptor.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.920]   The receptor can't engage the normal cellular functions
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.520]   of making that cell and you feel sleepy.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.320]   So the reason caffeine wakes you up
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.080]   is because it blocks the sleepiness receptor.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.800]   It blocks the sleepy signal.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.480]   And this is why when that caffeine wears off,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.560]   adenosine will bind to that receptor
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.560]   sometimes with even greater what we call affinity.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.840]   And you feel the crash.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.840]   You feel especially tired.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.700]   Caffeine has a lot of health benefits.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.820]   It also, for some people, can be problematic for health.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.920]   It can raise blood pressure, et cetera.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.200]   Caffeine increases this molecule
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.760]   that's a neuromodulator that we call dopamine.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.680]   We discussed this in episode one,
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.120]   which tends to make us feel good, motivated,
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.720]   and give us energy.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.880]   Because as you may have learned in episode one,
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.800]   dopamine is related to another neuromodulator
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.920]   called epinephrine, which gives us energy.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.360]   In fact, epinephrine is made from dopamine.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.640]   So let's just take a step back
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.400]   and think about what we're talking about
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.160]   when we're talking about sleepiness.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.920]   If you've ever pulled an all-nighter,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.800]   you'll notice something interesting.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.480]   As morning rolls around,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.160]   you'll suddenly feel an increase
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.080]   in your energy and alertness again,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.880]   even though adenosine has been building up
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.200]   for the entire night.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.740]   Why is that?
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.280]   The reason that is is because there's a second force,
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.380]   which is governing when you sleep and when you're awake.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.320]   And that force is a so-called circadian force.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.040]   Circadian means about a day or about 24 hours.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.760]   And inside all of us is a clock
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.080]   that exists in your brain and my brain
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.480]   and the brain of every animal that we're aware of
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.560]   that determines when we want to be sleepy
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.380]   and when we want to be awake.
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.240]   That block of sleep and when it falls
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.400]   within each 24-hour cycle
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.680]   is governed by a number of different things.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.400]   But the most powerful thing that's governing
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.800]   when you want to be asleep
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.520]   and when you want to be awake is light.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.140]   And in particular, it's governed by sunlight.
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.560]   Now, I can't emphasize enough how important
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.460]   and how actionable this relationship is
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.280]   between light and when you want to sleep.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.160]   It's quite simple on the face of it,
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.800]   and it's quite simple to resolve,
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.640]   but people tend to make a big mess
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.200]   of this whole circadian literature, frankly.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.000]   So let's just break it down from the standpoint
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.920]   of what's going on in your brain and body
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.120]   as you go through one 24-hour day.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.560]   Let's start with waking.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.680]   So regardless of how well you slept at night
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.080]   or whether or not you were up all night,
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.920]   most people tend to wake up sometime
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.280]   around when the sun rises.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.020]   When you wake up in the morning,
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.680]   you wake up because a particular hormone called cortisol
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.960]   is released from your adrenal glands.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.120]   Your adrenal glands sit right above your kidneys,
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.080]   and there's a little pulse of cortisol.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.040]   There's also a pulse of epinephrine,
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.960]   which is adrenaline, from your adrenals
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.280]   and also in your brain, and you feel awake.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.000]   Now, that pulse of cortisol and adrenaline
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.200]   and epinephrine might come from your alarm clock.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.840]   It might come from you naturally waking up.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.120]   But it tends to alert your whole system in your body
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.720]   that it's time to increase your heart rate,
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.240]   it's time to start tensing your muscles,
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.640]   it's time to start moving about.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.720]   It's very important that that cortisol pulse
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.800]   come early in the day,
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.560]   or at least early in your period of wakefulness.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.680]   When you wake up in the morning
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.880]   and you experience that rise in cortisol,
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.440]   there's a timer that starts going,
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.920]   and these are cellular timers,
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.640]   and they're dictated by the relation
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.520]   between different organs in your body,
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.080]   that says to your brain and body
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.280]   that in about 12 to 14 hours, a different hormone,
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.200]   this hormone we're calling melatonin,
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.160]   will be released from your pineal gland.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.560]   So there's two mechanisms here,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.280]   a wakefulness signal and a sleepiness signal.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.080]   And the wakefulness signal triggers the onset of the timer
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.800]   for the sleepiness signal.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.120]   Okay, so the rhythm of cortisol and melatonin
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.760]   is what we call endogenous.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.800]   It's happening in us all the time
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.720]   without any external input.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.080]   In fact, if we were in complete darkness,
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.240]   living in a cave with no artificial lights whatsoever,
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.080]   these rhythms of cortisol and melatonin would continue.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.240]   So if you were in complete darkness,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.360]   it would happen once per 24-hour cycle,
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.040]   but it would be somewhat later and later each day.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.280]   Whereas under normal circumstances,
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.600]   what happens is you wake up,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.400]   and what happens when you wake up?
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.720]   You open your eyes.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.160]   When you open your eyes, light comes into your eyes.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.880]   Now, the way this system works
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.120]   is that you have a particular set of neurons
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.240]   in your eye, they're called retinal ganglion cells.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.880]   When light comes into the eye,
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.880]   there's a particular group of retinal ganglion cells
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.200]   or type of retinal ganglion cells
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.400]   that perceives a particular type of light
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.480]   and communicates that to this clock
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.320]   that resides right above the roof of your mouth
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.800]   called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.720]   And the suprachiasmatic nucleus has connections
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.340]   with essentially every cell and organ of your body.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.080]   Now, it's vitally important
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.400]   that we get light communicated to this central clock
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   in order to time the cortisol and melatonin properly.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.280]   When I say properly, I can say that with confidence
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.800]   because we know based on a lot of evidence
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.200]   that if you don't get your cortisol
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.520]   and melatonin rhythms right,
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   there are tremendously broad and bad effects
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.760]   on cardiovascular health, metabolic effects,
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.280]   learning, depression, dementia.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.360]   So let's think about what happens
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.940]   when we do this correctly and how to do it correctly.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.220]   When we wake up, our eyes open.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.600]   Now, if we're in a dark room,
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.680]   there isn't enough light to trigger the correct timing
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.700]   of this cortisol melatonin thing, these rhythms.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.780]   You might say, well, why won't any light do it?
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.020]   Well, it turns out that these neurons in our eye
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.680]   that set the circadian clock
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.460]   and then allow our circadian clock
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.740]   to set all the clocks of all the cells and organs
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.340]   and tissues of our body,
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.800]   responds best to a particular quality of light
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.120]   and amount of light.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.680]   And those are the qualities of light
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.760]   and amount of light that come from sunlight.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.440]   So these neurons, what they're really looking for,
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.400]   although they don't have a mind of their own,
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.840]   is the sun at what we call low solar angle.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.480]   The eye and the nervous system don't know anything
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.260]   about sunrises or sunsets.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.720]   It only knows the quality of light that comes in
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.320]   when the sun is low in the sky.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.240]   The system evolved so that when the sun is low in the sky,
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.640]   there's a particular contrast between yellows and blues
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.280]   that triggers the activation of these cells.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.480]   However, if you wake up a few hours after the sunrise,
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.420]   which I tend to most days personally,
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.120]   you still want to get outside and view sunlight.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.960]   You don't need the sunlight beaming you
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.080]   directly in the eyes.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.460]   There's a lot of photons, light energy,
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.060]   that's scattered from sunlight at this time.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.720]   But the key is to get that light energy from sunlight,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.300]   ideally into your eyes.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.420]   It's critically important that you get outside
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.980]   to get this light.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.840]   I had a discussion with a colleague of mine,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.900]   Dr. Jamie Zeitzer,
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.580]   who's in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.020]   Sciences at Stanford, a world expert in this.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:03.020]   And he tells me that it's 50 times less effective
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.040]   to view this sunlight through a window,
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.660]   through a car windshield, or through a side window of a car,
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.660]   than it is to just get outside with no sunglasses
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.060]   and view light early in the day.
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.500]   Once the sun is overhead, the quality of light shifts
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.580]   so that you miss this opportunity
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.460]   to time the cortisol pulse.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.920]   And that turns out to be a bad thing to do.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.100]   You really want to time that cortisol pulse properly
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.260]   because, we'll get into this a little bit more later,
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.420]   but a late shifted cortisol pulse,
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.480]   in particular a 9 p.m. or 8 p.m. increase in cortisol,
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.480]   is one of the consequences and maybe one of the causes
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.460]   of a lot of anxiety disorders and depression.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.580]   So it's kind of a chicken egg thing.
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.560]   We don't know whether or not it's the correlated with,
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.540]   it's the cause or the effect,
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.800]   but it's a signature of depression and anxiety disorder.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.640]   Bringing that cortisol pulse earlier in your wakeful period,
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.940]   earlier in your day, has positive benefits,
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.440]   ranging from blood pressure to mental health, et cetera.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.480]   I'm not going to list them all off
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.160]   'cause there's just so many of them,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.360]   but many, many positive things happen
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.560]   when you are getting the cortisol early in the day,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.320]   far away from your melatonin pulse.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.020]   Okay, so how long should you be outside?
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.220]   Well, this is going to vary tremendously
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.800]   because some people live in environments
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.640]   where it's very bright.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.480]   So let's say it's Colorado in the middle of winter,
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.580]   there's a snow field,
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.960]   there's no cloud cover and you walk outside,
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.140]   there's going to be so much photon light energy
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.640]   arriving on your retina
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.800]   that it probably only takes 30 to 60 seconds
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.400]   to trigger the central clock
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.040]   and set your cortisol and melatonin rhythms properly
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.080]   and get everything lined up nicely.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.920]   Whereas if you're in Scandinavia in the depths of winter
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.120]   and you wake up at 5 a.m.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.680]   and the sun is just barely creeping across the horizon
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.120]   then goes back down again a few hours later,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.860]   you probably are not getting enough sunlight
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.180]   in order to set these rhythms.
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.480]   So many people find that they need to use
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.000]   sunlight simulators in the form of particular lights
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.760]   that were designed to simulate sunlight.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.620]   You could say, well, the lights in my house or my phone
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.120]   are really, really bright, right?
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.920]   Everyone's telling us to stay off our phones at night
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.320]   because they're really bright, but guess what?
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.520]   It turns out that early in the day,
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.440]   your retina is not very sensitive,
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.320]   which means you need a lot of photons
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.480]   ideally coming from sunlight to set these clock mechanisms.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.760]   So looking at your phone or artificial lights is fine
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.040]   if you wake up before sunrise,
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.600]   but it's not going to work to set these clock mechanisms.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.160]   So you want to use sunlight.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.300]   If you can't see sunlight because of your environment,
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.600]   then you are going to have to opt for artificial light.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.140]   And in that case, you're going to want an artificial light
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.000]   that either simulate sunlight or has a lot of blue light.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.840]   Now, without going off course here, you might be saying,
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.820]   wait, I've heard blue light is bad for me.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.740]   Actually, blue light is great for this mechanism
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.120]   during the day.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.960]   A lot of people will say,
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.040]   oh, I should be wearing blue blockers throughout the day.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.460]   No, that's the exact wrong thing.
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.300]   That should be reserved for late in the evening
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.680]   because light suppresses melatonin.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.460]   Sunlight inhibits the pineal.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.560]   It prevents it from releasing melatonin.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.480]   Darkness allows the pineal to release melatonin.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.260]   So the pineal is not the gland or the organ of sunlight.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.160]   It is the gland of darkness.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.480]   In fact, melatonin can be thought of as a sleepiness signal
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.240]   that's correlated with darkness.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.340]   So get up each morning, try and get outside.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.000]   I know that can be challenging for people,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.400]   but anywhere from two to 10 minutes of sunlight exposure
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.160]   is going to work well for most people.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.320]   If you can't do it every day,
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.720]   or you sleep through this period of the early day,
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.140]   low solar angle, don't worry about it.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.520]   The systems in the body,
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.060]   these hormone systems and neurotransmitter systems
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.560]   that make you awake at certain periods of the day
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.520]   and sleepy at other times are operating by averaging
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.900]   when you view the brightest light.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.860]   Some of you, many of you might be asking,
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.660]   what else can help set this rhythm?
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.220]   Well, it turns out that light
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.580]   is what we call the primary zeitgeber,
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.680]   the time giver.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:23.640]   But other things can help establish this rhythm of cortisol
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.220]   followed by melatonin 12 to 16 hours later as well.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.740]   The other things besides light are timing of food intake,
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.660]   timing of exercise,
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:38.100]   as well as various drugs or chemicals that one might ingest.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.180]   Not illegal drugs,
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.760]   although those will impact circadian mechanisms as well.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.700]   The other thing is sunset.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.880]   When the sun is also at low solar angle,
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.540]   low close to the horizon,
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.740]   by viewing sunlight at that time of day in the evening
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.620]   or afternoon, depending on what time of year it is
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.540]   and where you are in the world,
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.060]   these melanopsin cells, these neurons in your eyes
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.180]   signal the central circadian clock
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.500]   that it's the end of the day.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.420]   There was a really nice study that showed
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.540]   that viewing sunlight around the time of sunset
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.940]   doesn't have to be just crossing the horizon,
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.820]   but circa sunset within an hour or so of sunset
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.560]   prevents some of the bad effects of light
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.500]   in preventing melatonin release later that same night.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.420]   So let me repeat this.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.960]   Viewing light early in the day is key.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.140]   Viewing light later in the day when the sun is setting
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.580]   or around that time can help protect these mechanisms,
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.920]   your brain and body,
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.460]   against the negative effects of light later in the day.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.940]   So let me talk about how you would do that.
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.260]   You'd go view the sunset
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.460]   or you would go outside in the late afternoon or evening.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.340]   Again, if you want to do this through a window at work,
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.740]   that's fine, but it'll take 50 times longer.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.900]   So the best thing to do is just to get outside
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.740]   for a few minutes,
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.420]   anywhere from two to 10 minutes also in the afternoon.
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.780]   Having those two signals arriving to your central clock
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.220]   that your body, your internal world
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.420]   knows when it's morning and knows when it's evening
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.080]   is tremendously powerful.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.180]   There's always a lot of questions about how long,
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.780]   how much, how do I know if I've had enough?
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.960]   You'll know because your rhythm will start to fall
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.100]   into some degree of normalcy.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.100]   You'll start to wake up at more or less the same time
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:20.940]   each day.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.260]   You'll fall asleep more easily at night.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.980]   Generally, it takes about two or three days
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.660]   for these systems to align.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.900]   So if you've not been doing these behaviors,
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.140]   it's going to take a few days,
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.260]   but they can have tremendous benefits
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.860]   and sometimes rather quickly on a number of different
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.980]   mental and physical aspects of your health.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.860]   Now let's talk about the bad effects of light
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:44.380]   because light is not supposed to arrive in our system
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.580]   at any time.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.500]   And nowadays, because of screens and artificial light,
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.600]   we have access to light at times of day and night
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.620]   that normally we wouldn't.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.320]   Now, earlier I said that you need a lot of light
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.340]   in particular sunlight to set these clock mechanisms.
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.140]   That's true, but there's a kind of diabolical feature
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.260]   to the way all this works,
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.980]   which is the longer you've been awake,
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:12.100]   the more sensitive your retina and the cells are to light.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.860]   So that if you've been awake for 10, 12, 14 hours,
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.780]   it becomes very easy for even a small amount of light
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.500]   coming from a screen or from an overhead light
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.820]   to trigger the activation of the clock
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.700]   and make you feel like you want to stay up later,
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.940]   make it harder to fall asleep
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.100]   and disrupt your sleep pattern.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.500]   Okay, so the simple way to think about this
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.300]   is you want as much light as is safely possible
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.660]   early in the day, morning and throughout the day,
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.060]   including blue light.
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.060]   And you want as little light coming into your eyes,
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.780]   artificial or sunlight after say 8 p.m.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.740]   And certainly you do not want to get bright light exposure
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.820]   to your eyes between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.020]   And here's why.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.900]   Light that arrives to the eyes
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.720]   between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. approximately
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.180]   suppresses the release of dopamine,
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.100]   this neuromodulator that makes us feel good
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.660]   as sort of an endogenous antidepressant
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.880]   and can inhibit learning
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.460]   and create all sorts of other detrimental effects.
[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.140]   It does this through a mechanism,
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.320]   for those of you who want to know the neural pathways,
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.740]   that involves light to the eyes
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.400]   that's then signaled to a structure called the habenula.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.340]   When that habenula gets activated,
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.100]   it's actually called the disappointment nucleus
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:31.060]   because it actually makes us feel less happy
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.160]   and more disappointed
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.660]   and can lead to certain forms of depression
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.140]   in the wakeful state.
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.460]   Now, if you wake up in the middle of the night
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.420]   and you need to use the bathroom
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.740]   or you're on an all night flight
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:44.300]   and you need to read or whatever it is, fine.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.300]   Every once in a while, it's not going to be a problem
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.380]   to get bright light exposure to your eyes
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.820]   in the middle of the night.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.500]   But if you think about our lifestyle nowadays
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.100]   and being up late looking at phones,
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.780]   even if you dim that screen,
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.660]   you're triggering this activation
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.140]   because your retinal sensitivity
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.500]   and the sensitivity of these neurons
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.000]   has gone up late in the day.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.100]   For those of you that are experiencing challenges with mood,
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.200]   those of you that have anxiety, learning problems,
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.180]   issues focusing, the questions I usually get
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.380]   are how can I focus better?
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.980]   One of the best ways you can support your mechanisms
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.900]   for good mood, mental health,
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.740]   learning, focus, metabolism, et cetera,
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:23.100]   is to take control of this light exposure behavior at night
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.220]   and not get much or any bright light exposure
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.140]   in the middle of the night.
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.740]   These cells in our eye, these neurons
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.220]   that signal the central clock reside mostly,
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.640]   not exclusively, but mostly in the bottom half
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.880]   of our retina.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.320]   And because we have a lens in front of our retina
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.420]   and because of the optics of lenses,
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.960]   that means that these cells are actually viewing
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.600]   our upper visual field.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.200]   This is probably not coincidental
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.620]   that these cells were essentially designed
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.440]   to detect sunlight, which is overhead, of course.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:00.460]   So if you want to avoid improper activation of these neurons,
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:06.300]   it's better to place lights that you use in the evening
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.140]   low in your physical environment.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.300]   So on desktops or even the floor,
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.300]   if you want to go that way, as opposed to overhead lights.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.260]   So overhead fluorescent lights would be the worst.
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.660]   That would be the worst case scenario.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.100]   Lights that are overhead that are a little bit softer
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.380]   of the sort of yellow or reddish tints
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.420]   would be slightly better.
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.020]   But dim lights that are set low in the room
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.060]   are going to be best
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.540]   because they aren't going to activate these neurons
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.180]   and therefore shift your circadian clock.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.480]   But let's talk about what light can do
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.700]   in terms of shifting us in healthy ways.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.380]   So the way to think about this whole system,
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.100]   again, is you've got adenosine building up
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.220]   depending on how long you've been awake
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.300]   and it's making you sleepy.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.940]   And then you've got the circadian mechanisms
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.620]   that are timing your wakefulness
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.220]   and timing when you want to be asleep.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.540]   Mainly through cortisol and melatonin.
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.620]   But there are a bunch of other things
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.700]   that are downstream of cortisol and melatonin.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:05.220]   Like we tend to be hungrier during our wakeful period
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.180]   than late at night.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.940]   Some people like to eat it late at night.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.840]   But if you're finding that you can't become a day person
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.060]   or a morning person, shifting your light exposure,
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.380]   exercise and food intake to the daytime will help.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.420]   Jamie Zeitzer and colleagues did a beautiful study
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:25.420]   showing that if you turn on the lights before waking up,
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.840]   so around 45 minutes to an hour before waking up,
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.360]   even if your eyelids are closed,
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.660]   provided you're not under the covers,
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.740]   after doing that for a few days,
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.420]   that increases your total sleep time
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.380]   and shifts forward the time at which you feel sleepy.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.700]   It makes you want to go to bed earlier each night.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.180]   Now, in a kind of a diabolical way,
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.740]   they did this with teenagers who are notorious
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.500]   for wanting to wake up late and stay up late.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.940]   And what they found was bright light flashes,
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.420]   just turning on the lights in their environment,
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.820]   overhead lights, 'cause they're trying
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.060]   to activate the system.
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.520]   And that's why they're using overhead lights.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.120]   Even through the eyelids, before these kids woke up,
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.680]   then made those kids naturally want to go to bed earlier
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.220]   and they ended up sleeping longer.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.220]   So that's something you could try.
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.300]   You could put your lights on a timer to go on
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.000]   early in the day before you wake up.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.060]   You could open your blinds so that sunlight
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.260]   is coming through.
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.580]   Now, again, if you curl up under the covers,
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.300]   then it's not going to reach these neurons,
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.420]   but it's remarkable the light can actually penetrate
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.140]   the eyelids, activate these neurons,
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.540]   and go to the central clock.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.940]   That study illustrates a really important principle
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.080]   of how you're built, which is you have the capacity
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.040]   for what are called phase advances and phase delays.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.180]   And I don't want to complicate this too much.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.540]   So the simplest way to think about phase advances
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.540]   and phase delays is that if you see light late in the day,
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.900]   and in particular, in the middle of the night,
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.320]   your brain and body, for reasons that now you understand,
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.420]   will think that that's morning light,
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.560]   even though it's not sunlight,
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.140]   because you have this heightened sensitivity,
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.900]   and it will phase delay, it will delay your clock.
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.020]   It will essentially make you want to get up later
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.620]   and go to sleep later.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.940]   So the simple way to think about this
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.100]   is if you're having trouble waking up early
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.900]   and feeling alert early in the day,
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.500]   you're going to want to try and get bright light exposure
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.780]   even before waking up, because it will advance your clock.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.420]   It's sort of like turning the clock forward.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.940]   Whereas if you are having trouble waking up early,
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.140]   you definitely don't want to get too much light exposure
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.620]   or any light exposure to your eyes late in the evening
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.460]   and in the middle of the night,
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.180]   because it's just going to delay your clock more and more.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.940]   And what you're trying to do is provide them anchors.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.380]   You're trying to provide them consistent, powerful anchors
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.740]   so that your cortisol, your melatonin,
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.920]   and then everything that cascades down from that,
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.660]   like your metabolism and your ability to learn
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.740]   and your sense of alertness, your dopamine, your serotonin,
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.100]   all that stuff is timed regularly.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:03.100]   One of the reasons why there's so much challenge out there
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.460]   with focus and anxiety and depression,
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.780]   there are a lot of reasons for that,
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.900]   but one of the reasons is that people's internal mechanisms
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.740]   aren't anchored to anything regular.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.260]   These systems, again, will average,
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.380]   but if you can provide them consistent light anchors
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.260]   early in the day and in the evening
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.820]   and avoiding light at night,
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.180]   you will be amazed at the tremendous number
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.500]   of positive effects that can come from that
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.460]   at the level of metabolic factors, hormones,
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.560]   and just general feelings of wellbeing.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.060]   And this is why whenever people ask me, what should I take,
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.800]   which is one of the most common questions I get,
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.860]   what supplements should I take?
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.020]   What drugs should I be taking?
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.600]   What things should I be taking?
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:45.600]   The first question I always ask them is, how's your sleep?
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.800]   And 90% of the time, they tell me they either have trouble
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.100]   falling asleep or staying asleep,
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.700]   or they don't feel rested throughout the day.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.920]   A brief note about naps.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.900]   Naps, provided that they're less than one ultradian cycle,
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.860]   for either 20 minutes or 30 minutes, or even an hour,
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.940]   can be very beneficial for a lot of people.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.580]   You don't have to take them,
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.880]   but many people naturally feel a dip in energy and focus
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.940]   late in the afternoon.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.080]   In fact, if we were going to look at wakefulness,
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.320]   what we would find is that you get
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.760]   that morning light exposure, hopefully,
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.840]   your cortisol goes up, people start feeling awake,
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.160]   and then around two or three or four in the afternoon,
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.740]   there's a spike in everything from alertness
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.760]   to ability to learn, some metabolic factors drop,
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.880]   and then it just naturally comes back up,
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.520]   and then it tapers off as the night goes on.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.040]   So for some of you, naps are great.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.640]   I love taking naps.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.740]   Some people, they wake up from naps feeling really groggy.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.640]   That's probably because they're not sleeping as well
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.020]   as they should at night, or as long as they should at night,
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.660]   and so they're dropping into REM sleep
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.380]   or deeper forms of sleep in the daytime,
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.580]   and then they wake up and they feel kind of disoriented.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.180]   Other people feel great after a nap.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.780]   So that's another case where, just like with caffeine,
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.900]   you sort of have to evaluate for yourself.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.820]   Okay, so naps are going to be good for some people,
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.660]   not for others.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.820]   I personally like to take a nap around three or 4 p.m.,
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.920]   but there's a practice that I've adopted
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.520]   in the last five years
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.080]   that I've found to be immensely beneficial
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.040]   that is sort of like napping, but isn't napping.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.440]   It's a thing that they call yoga nidra.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.720]   Yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep,
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.320]   and it's a sort of meditation that you listen to.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.660]   Meditation and yoga nidra scripts
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.680]   have been immensely helpful for me
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.000]   in terms of accelerating the transition to sleep.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.840]   So they involve taking a few minutes,
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.540]   10 to 30 minutes or so, just like you would for a nap,
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.620]   and just listening to a script, almost passively.
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.800]   And it has you do some particular patterns of breathing
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.700]   and some other kind of body scan-like things
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.220]   that can really help people learn to relax,
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.740]   not just in that moment,
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.600]   but get better at relaxing and turning off thinking
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.260]   in order to fall asleep when they want to do that at night.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.220]   In other words, they're always good for you
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.860]   because it's a training mechanism
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.100]   by which you self-train your nervous system
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.640]   to go from a state of heightened alertness
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.420]   that you don't want to heightened relaxation
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.780]   that you do want.
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.660]   And so it's really teaching you to hit the brake.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.340]   And that brings us to an even more important point perhaps,
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.900]   which is we've all experienced
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.740]   that we can stay up if we want to, right?
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.260]   If we want to stay up late on New Year's
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.660]   or we want to push an all-nighter,
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.160]   some people can do that more easily than others,
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.720]   but we're all capable of doing that.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.260]   But it's very hard to make ourselves fall asleep.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.060]   And so there's a sort of asymmetry
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.000]   to the way our autonomic nervous system,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.200]   which governs this alertness calmness thing,
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.680]   the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.940]   There's an asymmetry there
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.840]   where we are more easily able to engage wakefulness
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.880]   and drive wakefulness.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.040]   We can force ourselves to stay awake.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.840]   Then we are able to force ourselves to fall asleep.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.720]   And one of the things that I say over and over again,
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.840]   and I'm going to continue to say over and over again,
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.820]   is it's very hard to control the mind with the mind.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.640]   When you have trouble falling asleep,
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.620]   you need to look to some mechanism that involves the body.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.020]   And all the things I described,
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.820]   meditation, hypnosis, yoga nidra,
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.100]   all involve exhale-emphasized breathing,
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.140]   certain ways of lying down and controlling the body.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.460]   We're going to get into breathing
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.460]   in real depth at another time.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.980]   But all of those involve using the body to control the mind
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.300]   rather than trying to, you know,
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.940]   wrestle your mind into a certain pattern of relaxation.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.060]   And when we're having trouble controlling the mind,
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.540]   I encourage people to look towards the body,
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.660]   look toward sunlight, avoid sunlight and bright light
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.520]   if that happens to be late at night.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.700]   So there's a theme that's starting to emerge,
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.040]   which is in order to control this thing
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.440]   that we call the nervous system,
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.660]   we have to look back to some of the things
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.880]   we discussed earlier, like sensation, perception, et cetera.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.080]   But we have to ask, what can we control?
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.120]   Well, I'm talking about controlling light exposure,
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.360]   controlling your breathing and body,
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.120]   non-sleep deep rest,
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.720]   or what hereafter we will refer to as NSDR,
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.400]   non-sleep deep rest,
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.640]   as a way to reset one's ability to be awake
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.440]   after you emerge from NSDR.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.920]   So to get some more wakefulness and ability to attend,
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.880]   some emotional stability reset,
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.000]   as well as make it better and easier to fall asleep
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.800]   when you want to go to sleep at night.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.360]   Now, non-sleep deep rest
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.500]   does have some research to support it.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.520]   There's a beautiful study done out of a university
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.000]   in Denmark, I will later provide a link to that study,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.720]   that showed that this meditation
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.560]   and yoga nidra type meditation
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.440]   allows dopamine and other neuromodulators
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.100]   in an area of the brain called the striatum,
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.360]   that's involved in motor planning and motor execution,
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.720]   to reset itself.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.200]   In other words, this NSDR can reset our ability
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.680]   to engage in the world in a way that's very deliberate.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.100]   Okay, so what about things that we can
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.060]   and maybe should or should not take
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.340]   in order to control and access better sleep
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.420]   and better wakefulness?
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.940]   There are a couple of things that are directly in line
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.400]   with the biology related to falling and staying asleep
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.420]   and directly in line with the biology of wakefulness.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:06.940]   There's a whole category of things like stimulants,
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.420]   cocaine, amphetamine, and prescription stimulants
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.020]   that are the prescription ones
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.940]   were designed for the treatment of narcolepsy.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.260]   So things like modafinil or armadafinil
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.660]   that are designed to create wakefulness.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:23.180]   They are all essentially chemical variants
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.100]   of things that increase epinephrine and dopamine.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.620]   Now, of course, I'm of the standpoint
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.140]   that things like cocaine and amphetamine
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.660]   are just across the board bad.
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.560]   They have so many addictive and terrible effects.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.580]   In the proper setting prescribed by the proper professional,
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:42.800]   things like modafinil for narcolepsy might be appropriate.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.080]   I know that a lot of people out there take Adderall,
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.580]   even though they haven't been prescribed Adderall
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.880]   in order to increase wakefulness.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.540]   That is essentially, well, it's illegal for one,
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.060]   but it's also, it's abusing the system in the sense
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.240]   that you're pushing back on the adenosine system
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.620]   slightly differently than you do caffeine.
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.860]   It will make you feel more alert.
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.060]   There tends to be a heavy rebound
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.860]   and they do have an addictive potential.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.420]   There are also some other effects of those
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.260]   that can be quite bad,
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.280]   but there are some supplements and some things
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.660]   that are safer, certainly safer.
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.520]   And that in cases where you're doing
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.580]   all the right behaviors,
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.100]   you're exercising and eating correctly,
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.800]   and you're still having trouble with sleep,
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.420]   that can be beneficial for falling and staying asleep.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.460]   Now, I want to be very clear.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.900]   I am not pushing supplements.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.140]   I'm just pointing you towards some things
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.700]   that have been shown in peer-reviewed studies
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.760]   to have some benefit.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.220]   The first one is magnesium.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.720]   There are many forms of magnesium,
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.100]   but certain forms of magnesium can have positive effects
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.240]   on sleepiness and the ability to stay asleep,
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:49.140]   mainly by way of increasing neurotransmitters like GABA.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.940]   There are a lot of forms of magnesium out there,
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.620]   but one in particular is magnesium threonate,
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.440]   T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.740]   which you have to check to see if this is right for you.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.820]   Check with your doctor.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.600]   The other thing is theanine,
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.780]   theanine.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.140]   100 to 200 milligrams of theanine, for me,
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:15.020]   also helps me turn off my mind and fall asleep.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.420]   Interestingly, theanine is now being introduced
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.380]   to a lot of energy drinks
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.600]   in order to take away the jitters
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.980]   that are associated with drinking too much caffeine
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.120]   or with some other things that are in the energy drinks.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.340]   So just a consideration.
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.300]   Again, I'm not here to tell you what to do or not do,
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.500]   but just want to arm you with information.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:38.200]   The thing about theanine and magnesium is taken together.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.800]   They do, for some people,
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.600]   they can make them so sleepy and sleep so deeply
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.380]   that they actually have trouble waking up in the morning.
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.540]   So you have to play with these things and titrate them
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.640]   if you decide to use them.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.180]   Again, if you decide to go this route.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.460]   I would not start by taking supplements.
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.820]   I would start by getting your light viewing behavior correct
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.400]   and then think about your nutrition
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.700]   and then think about your activity
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.160]   and then think about whether or not you want a supplement.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.260]   We already talked about melatonin earlier.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.220]   There's another supplement that could be quite useful,
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.100]   which is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N,
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.060]   which is a derivative of chamomile.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:13.780]   50 milligrams of apigenin also can augment
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.540]   or support this kind of creation of a sleepiness
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.460]   to help fall asleep and stay asleep.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.680]   As a important point,
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.340]   apigenin is a fairly potent estrogen inhibitor.
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:29.080]   So women who want to keep their estrogen levels high
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.020]   or at whatever levels they happen to be at
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.540]   should probably avoid apigenin altogether.
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:37.140]   And men take that into consideration as well.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.380]   Men need estrogen also.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.740]   You don't want to completely eliminate your estrogen.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.420]   That can create all sorts of bad effects
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.020]   on libido and cognition, et cetera.
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.040]   So apigenin in some people
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.880]   is going to be a pretty strong estrogen inhibitor.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.560]   So keep that in mind.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.500]   So thank you so much for your time and attention.
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.260]   And above all, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.840]   [upbeat music]
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.420]   (upbeat music)
