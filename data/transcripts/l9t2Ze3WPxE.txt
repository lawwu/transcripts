[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.920]   We are going to close out the week with an email from a listener named David.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.560]   "Hello Pastor John.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.840]   Up until his crucifixion, Jesus faced more opposition from the Pharisees and others with
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.280]   an unhealthy religious spirit than he did from the Romans and the secular society around
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.280]   him.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.560]   Do you believe that in a similar way the greatest opposition to God's kingdom today comes from
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.160]   within the church or within the religious world more so than the secular world?"
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.520]   Pastor John, how would you answer this question?
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:46.520]   I think the best way to answer that question is to say that the point of greatest conflict
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:55.320]   with the advance of God's saving rule, God's kingdom, is not the church or the world, but
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.440]   rather to say that the point of greatest conflict with the advance of God's rule will always
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:13.360]   be the very place where the point of the spear of truth is penetrating the sphere of unbelief
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.880]   and unrighteousness and intruding upon the dominion of darkness.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:27.520]   In other words, there's nothing peculiar about religion or irreligion that makes it stand
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.920]   in opposition to the gospel.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.960]   What always stands in opposition to the gospel is sin and its root in unbelief.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.280]   And that unbelief and that sin may be found in the world and it may be found in the institutions
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.240]   of religion, including the churches.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:57.280]   So the reason the gospels tell the story of Jesus in a way that shows how much conflict
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.780]   there was with the Jewish religious establishment, which were embodied in the scribes and Pharisees
[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:15.360]   and chief priests, is not because they were less receptive than the Romans to the message
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.400]   of Jesus, but because Jesus was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.280]   In other words, the reason there was such resistance from the Pharisees is because that's
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.560]   where the spear of truth was pointed.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.120]   Jesus wasn't doing any evangelism among the Greeks and Romans.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.040]   He was doing evangelism among his own people, because that's what God said to the Jew first,
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.720]   then we'll get to the Greeks very quickly.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:52.120]   We get a pretty clear glimpse of the reception that Jesus would have had if he had focused
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.640]   on the Romans by looking at Pilate and Herod, who became very good friends when they were
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.400]   formerly enemies in their common animosity to Jesus.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.960]   And it was, as everybody knows, on a Roman cross where Jesus died.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.040]   So the implication of what I'm saying is this, because that's what I've been asked, what's
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.440]   the implication?
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:26.440]   The implication is if the true radical, whole counsel of God's revelation begins to penetrate
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:35.240]   a church that is full of worldliness and unspirituality and nominalism, with no passion for the gospel,
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.000]   no zeal for the lost, no heart for missions, no brokenness because of its own sinfulness,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.480]   no fervor in worship, no love for the scriptures, if the true radical, whole counsel of God's
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:56.800]   revelation begins to penetrate that church, there's going to be plenty of opposition.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.480]   And it might feel to a faithful pastor as though, "Good grief, I'm getting more opposition
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.360]   in the church than on the street."
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.640]   On the other hand, if that radical, true, whole counsel of God's revelation is proclaimed
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.320]   in a secular venue, like a university classroom or a businessman's gathering or a PTA meeting
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.920]   or a non-Christian religious venue like a mosque or a Hindu temple in Minneapolis, say,
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:34.240]   if that true, radical, whole counsel of God's revelation is proclaimed with conviction in
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.220]   those non-Christian settings, there will be plenty of opposition.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:50.080]   So I doubt that we should have a mindset that says, "More opposition is going to come from
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.220]   the church," or, "More opposition is going to come from the world."
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:06.840]   Opposition is going to come from sin and unbelief wherever it is found to the degree that our
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:14.220]   message is true and radical and full and faithful to the whole counsel of God in Scripture.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.980]   So I think the final implication then would be this.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.860]   Let's not fret about who our worst enemies are.
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:34.100]   Let's look upon every person and every group as a group who needs the gospel, church or
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:45.160]   non-church, and let's make it our aim to penetrate the darkness of unbelief and sin by the faithfulness
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.860]   of our preaching and our witnessing, whether in church or in the world.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:06:00.180]   And it may be, it may be that in God's power and His mercy, He would cause a nominal church
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:09.580]   to explode, not with opposition, but with awakening and reformation and joyful renewal.
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.780]   And it may be that in our neighborhood or in our other non-religious connections, God
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:23.100]   would be pleased by His power and mercy to bring about a stunning sensitivity to the
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.500]   gospel and eagerness to hear the truth.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:33.660]   So let's never talk ourselves into defeat in either case, as though we knew where opposition
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.820]   were coming from and where it's going to be more prevalent.
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.900]   It will come from unbelief.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.140]   It will come from sin.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.060]   It will come in the church.
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.420]   It will come in the world.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:53.700]   But the gospel is the power of God unto salvation in the church and in the world.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:00.220]   And you never know, you never know what triumphs may lie ahead.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.220]   Amen.
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.460]   That is hopeful and full of faith in the power of God.
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.980]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.580]   Well, we're going to break for the weekend now.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.780]   And when we return on Monday, we have a question from a female listener to the podcast who
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.740]   is single, and she wants to know if her singleness, her ongoing singleness is pointing to a deficiency
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.740]   within herself.
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:44.380]   It's a deep question rooted in deep insecurities, and it's an important question that we will
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.260]   address on Monday with longtime author and pastor John Piper.
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.260]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.780]   We'll see you then.
