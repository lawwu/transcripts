[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820]   Let me talk a little bit about my goals for cards this year.
[00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.100]   So I am always looking to maximize the earnings I get
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.740]   from all my everyday spending,
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.680]   all the category spending I have,
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.480]   but I'm not just gonna get a card
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.460]   because it earns more points on something I could spend on.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.720]   Let's say I spend $500 a year on entertainment
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.500]   and right now I would be putting it on a 2X points card
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.600]   and now there's a card that offers 3X points on entertainment.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.320]   I'm just gonna get an extra 500 points a year
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.680]   from that deal because I could have otherwise gotten the 2X.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.060]   So getting 500 points, which might be valued
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.040]   no more than five to $10 is not worth me opening up a new card.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.900]   So I really wanna see that the value I'm gonna get
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.960]   from a new card is probably gonna exceed at least $200 a year
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.160]   is probably the floor before I'm interested in opening it.
