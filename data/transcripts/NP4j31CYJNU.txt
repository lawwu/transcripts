[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   I'm almost hesitant to ask this question, but I'm going to do it anyway.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.600]   Many times online, you are asked whether or not you will run for office.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.880]   And I want to say that I think it's a true compliment.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.840]   I don't think people are asking just to kind of entertain themselves.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.840]   I think that this country certainly and a lot of the world is desperate for certain
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.800]   kinds of leaders and people that have experience in high-risk, high-consequence, chaotic situations
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.000]   and have shown prowess at leadership in multiple domains.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.920]   And you are certainly one of those individuals.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.160]   And so they ask for that reason, among others.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.240]   And I've heard you give your answer.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.120]   You can repeat it again here.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.020]   But as a more broad theme that I think people are interested in, do you think it's an important
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:03.360]   criteria or it would be great to see people in positions of leadership who've had wartime
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.360]   experience?
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.480]   And do you think that some of the shifts that we've seen in terms of patterns of leadership
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.200]   over the last-- let's just make it real broad so that this isn't related to any particular
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.040]   person or stretch of history.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.540]   But over the last, let's just say, 25 years, reflect the fact that we haven't seen a lot
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.440]   of that, at least at the top tiers of leadership.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:30.620]   Yeah, I think it'd be excellent if people-- if the president had military experience,
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.620]   for sure.
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.160]   I think that then they understand with the way the military works better.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.300]   They understand that it's civilians that control the military, because a lot of times people
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.140]   that are civilians don't understand that the civilians control the military.
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:54.020]   And I think that you do get to appreciate what war actually is and what the costs are.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.500]   I think that I've seen, in the same vein of people asking me to run for political office,
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.900]   I've seen comments saying, oh, that's what we need, a warmonger in office.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.900]   And I've responded to a few of those.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.900]   I think if there's any group of people that don't want war, it's people that have seen
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.900]   it, people that understand what the sacrifices are.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.300]   And I think that being in the military, people understand that better.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.540]   So yeah, I think it'd be a great qualification.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.540]   I don't think it's mandatory.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.860]   I mean, clearly it's not.
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.220]   We've had a bunch of presidents that haven't ever served anything-- really, we've had a
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.740]   bunch of presidents that haven't ever served anything but themselves.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.660]   So yeah, hopefully we'll get some more people that have some experience in the military,
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.260]   some combat experience would be especially nice.
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.660]   And that would be good, in my opinion.
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.660]   Well, I'm certainly not one to tell people what to do, and I'm certainly not going to
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.660]   tell you what to do.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.940]   But should you ever choose to run, I would certainly be very enthusiastic about that.
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.260]   And I will just say that with that stated, I hope people do hear what you just said.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.180]   I share that sentiment.
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.660]   People who have led others besides themselves, I think, is the key statement there.
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.580]   Yeah, and look, I have friends that are politicians, and I really appreciate what they're doing.
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.580]   And it looks miserable to me.
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.060]   I don't like what I-- good for them.
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.340]   I'm happy that they're in there trying to make a difference.
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.980]   And I guess this is me being selfish of me saying, look, I don't think I could stomach
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.980]   that.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.140]   But I also think that right now, I'm trying to help out-- like, for instance, we have,
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.300]   obviously, you've got the Leadership and Consulting International on front.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.940]   We're trying to help businesses grow.
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.980]   I've got OriginUSA.
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.100]   We're bringing manufacturing back to America.
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.660]   We've got 400 and 450 employees right now that are here in America working and growing
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.660]   that business.
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.580]   Obviously, the supplements-- so everything that I'm doing here right now is to try and
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.660]   move the needle with America bringing manufacturing back, helping the economy as much as I can
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.660]   right now.
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.380]   So that's kind of what I'm doing right now.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:25.300]   And my standard answer, which you alluded to, is if things got bad enough, then I would
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.100]   do what I had to do.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.540]   But I don't think people appreciate my level of bad.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.960]   I'm talking real bad.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.420]   So it's not there yet.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.380]   And hopefully, it never will get there.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.020]   I'd rather surf and hang out with my friends and hang out with my family than do that.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.820]   And hopefully, America can find some level of balance.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.580]   I think that's the problem that we're having right now.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.100]   And a lot of these things that you talked about-- specifically, the thing you talk about
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.700]   on social media is not very good for political balance.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.820]   It's actually horrible for political balance, and a lot of it has to do with just the way
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.220]   that those conversations are had.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.560]   A lot of it has to do with ego as well, because I don't ever want to admit that I'm wrong
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.360]   about anything.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.820]   And if I can find something that I think you might be wrong about, it's so satisfying to
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.460]   my ego to just call you out on that thing and attack you.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.420]   And I think that's what a lot of people are doing right now.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.420]   Now, that being said, also, I also usually say this as well.
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.760]   I travel around the country all the time.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.100]   I work with companies of all sizes, work with people in every different industry, and they're
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:41.140]   not sitting around arguing with each other about the political scenery.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.800]   They're talking about, hey, how can we grow our business?
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.940]   How can we take care of our workers?
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.940]   How can we take care of our clients?
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.580]   How can we take care of our customer?
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.300]   That's what people are focused on.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.680]   And when you jump on social media, you can get sucked into the political scene very easily.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:03.060]   And that being said, also, we do have to pay attention, because we as citizens have to
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:12.860]   make sure that America stays on the correct path, within the guardrails of what this country
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.200]   is based on.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:21.040]   So we do have to pay attention, but I will be doing my part as a civilian until there's
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.920]   total mayhem and chaos in the streets, then I'll probably just be a benevolent dictator
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.920]   that takes over.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.220]   That should be an interesting one, but, hey, you would be the man to lead under any conditions.
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.920]   But thank you for stating your threshold.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   Certainly you've earned the right to make whatever decision is that feels right for
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920]   you.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.120]   And I want to say that I agree.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.780]   I feel like we are a country that still includes a ton of generators and a ton of projectors
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.680]   that are interested in projecting the good and growing the good.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.200]   I do believe both those phenotypes are important.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:59.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
