[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.140]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.380]   Today, my guest is Dr. Kyle Gillette.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.080]   Dr. Kyle Gillette is a dual board certified physician
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.500]   in family medicine and obesity medicine,
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.180]   and an expert in hormone optimization.
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.180]   He is an MD, that is a medical doctor,
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.020]   and he treats patients with a variety of backgrounds,
[00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.660]   ages, and goals.
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.640]   Today, we discuss male hormone optimization.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.240]   We discuss behavioral tools, nutrition-based tools,
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.740]   supplement-based tools, prescription drug-based tools,
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.240]   and their interactions in determining overall levels
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.620]   of testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone,
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.680]   estrogen growth hormone, thyroid hormone,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.980]   and many other hormones that impact mood, libido,
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.060]   well-being, strength, cognition,
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.340]   and various psychological factors.
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.060]   We covered hormone optimization in both men and women
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.880]   in previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.220]   but today's discussion is different.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.040]   Dr. Kyle Gillette offers very specific recommendations
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.820]   for people with different goals and of different ages,
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.940]   and we get deep into the weeds of, for instance,
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.400]   how does one know whether or not their testosterone
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.040]   is optimized or not?
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.320]   How often to test for specific hormones,
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.260]   such as testosterone and other hormones,
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.020]   and really how to gauge how good one should feel.
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.080]   This is something that's often overlooked in discussions
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.740]   about hormone optimization or health optimization
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.420]   of any kind, for that matter.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.700]   For instance, people will talk about reduced libido
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.180]   and discuss whether or not testosterone levels are to blame,
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.760]   but how does one calibrate their libido in the first place?
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.020]   That is, how does one know whether or not their libido
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.820]   is normal, too low, or too high?
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.720]   We also discuss, for instance, whether or not
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.260]   hormone optimization should be pursued continually
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.060]   throughout the year, for instance, whether or not
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.120]   you should cycle on and off supplements
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.720]   and/or prescription drugs geared towards hormone optimization
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.480]   and we discuss the behavioral foundations
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.160]   of optimal hormone function.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.440]   These are things that every male should be doing
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.020]   and various things they should actively avoid
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.400]   if their goal is to have healthy hormones
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.580]   and to quote unquote optimize their levels of every hormone
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.780]   from growth hormone to testosterone at any stage of life.
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.220]   And while today's discussion is about
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.300]   male hormone optimization, I want to emphasize
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.720]   that we discuss all the various ages
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.700]   for male hormone optimization.
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.700]   So for those of you that are parents,
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.420]   for those of you that are young,
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.720]   those of you that are middle-aged or old or teenagers,
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.640]   we explore adolescent, puberty, teen and late teens,
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.040]   early adulthood, adulthood and into the late geriatric ages.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.460]   So regardless of your age and whether or not
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.060]   you are male or female,
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.500]   today's episode ought to be of interest to you.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.820]   I should also point out that we will soon also
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.500]   be hosting an expert guest on female hormone optimization.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.480]   One thing that I'm certain people of all ages
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.120]   and biological sex will enjoy about today's conversation
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.100]   is that we also get into descriptions of how psychology
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.180]   and life events impact hormones
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.660]   and how hormones impact our psychology
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.140]   and the way that we show up to various life events.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.460]   So today is really a broad overview
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.900]   that goes all the way down to fine details
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.660]   about male hormone optimization.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.060]   And I'm certain that by the end of today's episode,
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.540]   you'll have an immense amount of new information
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.280]   about how this endocrine, that is hormone system
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.080]   in your body works and how it interacts with your brain
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.500]   and other tissues and many, many actionable tools
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.300]   that you can pursue regardless of stage of life.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.700]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.300]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.220]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.220]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.360]   about science and science related tools
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.520]   to the general public.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.620]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.320]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.540]   Our first sponsor is Thesis.
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.740]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.540]   And as I've said many times before on this podcast,
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.880]   I am not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.800]   because it means smart drugs.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.360]   And frankly, there are no specific neural circuits
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.420]   in the brain or body for being quote unquote smart.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.980]   Thesis understands this and they developed custom nootropics
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.820]   that are designed to bring your brain and body
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.460]   into the state that's ideal for what you need to accomplish.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.940]   They use the highest quality ingredients,
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.900]   things like phosphatidylserine, alpha-GPC,
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.500]   many ingredients that I've talked about before
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.180]   on this podcast and that I happen to use myself.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.940]   I've been using Thesis for over a year now
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.740]   and I can confidently say that their nootropics
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.300]   have been a game changer.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.180]   For me, I like their nootropic for clarity.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.340]   I use that before cognitive work often,
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.540]   and I like their nootropic for energy
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.100]   and I often use that before workouts,
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.740]   in particular workouts that are especially intense.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.580]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.140]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.180]   take their three minute quiz
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.320]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.440]   to try in your first month.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.260]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.060]   and use the code Huberman at checkout
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.160]   to get 10% off your first box.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.720]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.780]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.060]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.100]   The company was founded by two all American swimmers
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.680]   from Stanford and everything about Roca eyeglasses
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.640]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.380]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology,
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.920]   the visual system, and I can tell you
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.660]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.160]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.540]   in order for you to see clearly.
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.260]   For instance, when you move from a sunny area
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.080]   to a shady area and back again,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.620]   whether or not you're looking at something up close
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.900]   or off into the distance.
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.260]   Roca understands the biology of the visual system
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.460]   and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.300]   accordingly so that you always see with perfect clarity.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.260]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.740]   for activities such as running and cycling,
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.260]   and indeed they are very lightweight.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.660]   Most of the time I can't even remember
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.700]   that they're on my face, they're so lightweight.
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.780]   But the important thing to know about Roca eyeglasses
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.460]   and sunglasses is that while they can be used
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.100]   during sports activities,
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.980]   they also have a terrific aesthetic
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.860]   and they can be used just as well for wearing to work
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.900]   or out to dinner, et cetera.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.340]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.180]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.840]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.680]   on your first order.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.940]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.180]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.980]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.540]   Helix makes mattresses and pillows
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.600]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.340]   I started sleeping on a Helix mattress well over a year ago
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.940]   and it's been the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.500]   One of the things that makes Helix mattresses so unique
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.340]   is that they match the design of the mattress
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.000]   to your unique sleep needs.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.560]   So for instance, if you go onto their website,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.660]   you can take a brief quiz.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.860]   It only takes about two or three minutes
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.680]   and you'll answer questions
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.980]   like do you tend to run hot or cold throughout the night
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.380]   or whether or not you sleep on your back,
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.940]   your side of your stomach, or maybe you don't know.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.660]   Regardless, they will match you to the custom mattress
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.300]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.980]   For me, that was the Dusk D-U-S-K mattress,
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.900]   which for me was not too firm, not too soft
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.340]   and was ideal for my sleep patterns.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.820]   You take the quiz and you'll find out
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.060]   what mattress is ideal for your sleep patterns.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.760]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.380]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.500]   take their brief sleep quiz,
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.100]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.740]   and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.220]   and two free pillows.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.300]   They have a 10-year warranty
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.500]   and you get to try out the mattress
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.460]   for a hundred nights risk-free.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.380]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.840]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.320]   for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.460]   The Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.300]   is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.620]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.820]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.460]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.020]   livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.860]   And I should just mention
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.580]   that the library of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.740]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.100]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Kyle Gillette.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.440]   Dr. Gillette, great to have you back.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.600]   - Great to be back, thank you.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.060]   - I'd like to begin with a question
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.380]   about one of the most mysterious
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.460]   and important phases of life, which is puberty.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.940]   I've long wondered whether or not
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.380]   how quickly somebody goes into puberty, so at what age,
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.400]   and how long puberty takes.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.500]   So how brief or protracted that puberty is
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.860]   for them to acquire
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.940]   the so-called secondary sexual characteristics,
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.600]   things like hair growth on the face for males,
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.780]   changes in bone and muscle density and growth, et cetera.
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.960]   When I was in middle school and high school,
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.420]   I noticed that some people transitioned
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.620]   into all that very fast,
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.140]   and some people took a long time
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.800]   to acquire those characteristics.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.060]   Can we learn anything about ourselves, our hormones,
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.220]   and maybe even how long we're going to live
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.400]   based on the time in which we enter puberty,
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.220]   and how long it takes us to progress through puberty?
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.820]   I guess that also raises the question,
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.800]   does puberty ever truly end?
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.060]   - There are many takeaways from puberty.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.120]   Some of the actionable items from it is,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.400]   yes, it can and does affect your adult height,
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.740]   and also stature, and also body composition.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.660]   So puberty is a time, and if we're talking specifically
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.180]   about males, think of it as a time
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.140]   where if you have obesity as a child,
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.020]   you could potentially use that time
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.580]   to change your lifestyle and habits and reset things,
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.500]   and it is a bit easier.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.500]   It's almost like a free injection of testosterone
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.020]   and metabolism and drive and effort into your life.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.620]   There is a wide variation in how quickly
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.100]   puberty goes through.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.680]   So there's stages called tanner stages,
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.740]   which we don't necessarily need to get into,
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.300]   but if you enter puberty very early,
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.120]   then it can decrease your adult height or stature.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.060]   - So for a given male that enters puberty at 13
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.320]   versus a male that enters puberty at 15,
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.740]   can we say that the guy that entered puberty at 13
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.940]   is going to be shorter than the guy that entered puberty
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.460]   at 15, or it's not quite that straightforward?
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.600]   - If they are identical twins and the individual
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.380]   who entered puberty at age 13 also finished puberty,
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.020]   went all the way through the tanner stages,
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.340]   and if you do a bone scan,
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.060]   which I believe is usually done on the left wrist,
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.400]   and it says, yes, your growth plates are mostly closed,
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.820]   you're not going to grow more than a couple inches
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.260]   of height after that.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.960]   - Okay, just a related question.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.400]   When I was growing up, it was thought,
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.940]   or at least people would say,
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.600]   that resistance training, in particular,
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.660]   lifting heavy weights could stunt one's growth.
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.920]   Is that true or false?
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.240]   - It is false when you're talking about
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.620]   just lifting heavy weights.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.120]   Dirty bulking certainly has the potential
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.740]   to stunt one's growth for two main mechanisms.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.760]   - Could you define dirty bulking?
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.700]   - So dirty bulking is eating an excess of calories,
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.700]   not just to acquire lean, metabolically active body mass,
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.280]   or get stronger, but purposely acquiring body fat.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:07.340]   - So purposely acquiring muscle and fat by overeating
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.660]   and lifting weights can stunt one's growth.
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.780]   Do I have that correct?
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.840]   - Correct.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.500]   So it does two things.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.460]   If you're doing it as a very young child,
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.500]   it can, that fat can become leptin resistant
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.420]   and it can produce more leptin.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.780]   And that leptin can activate the hypothalamus,
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.860]   which activates the pituitary,
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.220]   which releases gonadotropins,
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.820]   which basically just increase testosterone and estrogen
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.580]   earlier than it otherwise would have.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.180]   It's the same mechanism behind why childhood obesity
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.980]   causes early puberty.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.820]   - Interesting.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.740]   I do remember a paper published in Science Magazine,
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.940]   I believe it was focused mainly on females,
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.020]   but showing that when enough body fat accumulates,
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.380]   the hormone leptin is secreted
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.480]   and that triggers the onset of puberty.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.320]   - Correct.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.660]   - Given the increase in childhood obesity
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.260]   that we're observing now,
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.300]   are we seeing an earlier onset of puberty
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.860]   in males and females?
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.120]   - Yes, in both males and females.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.100]   Not to get too technical,
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.140]   but there's a G protein coupled receptor on the hypothalamus
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.940]   and leptin directly binds it.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.820]   So it does appear directly causatory
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.700]   and not just correlation.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.260]   - Okay, so, and if I understand correctly,
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.620]   what you're saying is for a young guy,
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.420]   let's say 13, 14, who wants to really bulk up
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.260]   and deliberately, excuse me, overeats
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.060]   and is doing their squats and deadlifts and bench presses
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.320]   and really trying to get big,
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.020]   they will get big, but only in the lateral dimension.
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:38.100]   They're effectively limiting their total height
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.520]   and it can shut down the long bone growth of their limbs.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.520]   Is that correct?
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.360]   - Correct.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.740]   The growth of the long bones is mostly related
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.920]   to the estradiol alpha receptor.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.540]   So basically one of the receptors for estrogen,
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.580]   which can be secondary to early puberty
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.700]   and also is related to body fat
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.840]   because you have that conversion of testosterone to estrogen.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.340]   - So can we assume that if a young male
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.860]   wants to get into resistance training,
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.180]   that body weight exercises are probably okay
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.660]   and maybe even some weight training, kettlebells, et cetera,
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.740]   but that they should avoid doing so-called dirty bulking,
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.500]   trying to deliberately gain weight up until what age?
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.900]   Until puberty is over?
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.020]   - I would say an individual should limit the amount
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.520]   of body, abnormal body fat accumulation
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.100]   or dirty bulking indefinitely throughout their entire life.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.800]   - So again, if I understand correctly,
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.200]   that recommendation to avoid deliberate weight gain
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.940]   or rapid weight gain is not just to allow an individual
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.900]   to reach their maximum height,
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.460]   but also to avoid laying down
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.000]   a lot of body fat cells, correct?
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.840]   - Correct.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.460]   The balance between that is
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.260]   when you are going through puberty,
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.860]   you are able to add a lot of lean body mass,
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.920]   not just muscle mass, but bone mass and other mass as well.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.860]   - I started lifting weights when I was 16
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:07.100]   and I confess I trained pretty heavy at times.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.360]   I don't know whether or not I would have been taller
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.620]   than I am now, but when I started that training,
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.800]   I had already reached what was at least close
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.120]   to my predicted height.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.560]   I can't say that I deliberately waited until I had grown.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.780]   It just so happened that I stumbled into the weight room
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.140]   and found that I liked it at age 16,
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.300]   at which point I was already the height that I am now.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.500]   So in any case, what I'm hearing is that laying down
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.580]   a lot of excess body fat is not a good idea.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:39.580]   What if somebody grows up chubby or fat for whatever reason,
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.040]   reasons related to the eating patterns in their family,
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.900]   maybe even some genetic reasons,
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.080]   is it safe and or wise for a young person,
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.080]   so let's say somebody who's around the age of puberty
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.700]   or even younger or in their late teens to be dieting
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.440]   and actively trying to lose body fat, is that safe?
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.160]   - Under the supervision of a physician,
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.200]   it is certainly safe to change your body composition.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.520]   In pediatric obesity medicine,
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.380]   you're often talking about a recomposition
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.580]   or a renormalization of the growth curve
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.420]   compared to peers.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.600]   - Great, thank you.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.040]   So as you may have sensed,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.180]   we started chronologically with puberty,
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.440]   and I know that there's another puberty
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.360]   that even precedes the puberty that we're all familiar with.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.120]   Maybe if you want to just briefly mention that,
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.800]   'cause I was talking with you about this before we started,
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.420]   the puberty that I'm most familiar with,
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.360]   and I think most people are most familiar with,
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.000]   the acquisition of deepening of the voice,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.300]   growth of muscle and bone, body hair,
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.380]   acquisition of libido and things like that,
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.120]   that's actually the second puberty that we all go through.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.760]   Maybe just mention for us and educate us
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.880]   on the first puberty.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.280]   I think most people will be hearing this
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.880]   for the very first time.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.080]   - The first puberty of everyone's life
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.620]   is the first three months of their life.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.600]   You may notice that your baby has more acne
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.600]   the first three months,
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.900]   and that they also have in general,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.320]   just more changes related to androgens and estrogens,
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.340]   perhaps oilier skin, even more genitourinary,
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.460]   like genital growth during the first three months.
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.780]   And this is mostly due to DHEA,
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.720]   which is an adrenal hormone.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.060]   The second puberty or the puberty that most people know of
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.300]   actually starts that same way as well.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.620]   It's called adrenarchy and it's when the adrenals kick in,
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.020]   I guess for the second time.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.420]   - Is there a standard age or age range
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.780]   in which the testicles descend in males?
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.020]   - Usually before birth.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.360]   It is not uncommon to have one
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.720]   or even two undescended testes,
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.560]   but there is a risk of testicular cancer,
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.880]   especially if they're not fixed early
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.060]   and also heat damage to the teste.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.880]   - Well, thank you for that coverage of the two pubertys.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.760]   So early in life,
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.480]   I imagine some of our listeners are probably
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.520]   still in one or the other puberty.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.960]   The ones that are in the first puberty obviously
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.180]   aren't aware that they're listening to this podcast,
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.740]   but maybe it'll be embedded in their subconscious.
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.620]   But some listeners probably are still in puberty,
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.560]   but I think everyone can remember back to their puberty
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.480]   and roughly when they first entered puberty
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.040]   and how quickly they aggregated
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.920]   the secondary sex characteristics.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.800]   I'd like to turn now to a general question
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.600]   about what all males ought to do
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.180]   in order to optimize their hormones.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.600]   So if you could just list off the things
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.460]   that all males should do on a daily basis, weekly basis.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.700]   I mean, should guys in their teens and twenties
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.660]   be getting their blood work done?
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.240]   Should they be taking supplements?
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.760]   We already talked about weight training.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.600]   What should they be doing?
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.440]   What should they avoid doing
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.600]   if the goal is to have a long arc
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.240]   of healthy hormone optimization throughout the lifespan?
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.760]   - There's many things that you should do.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.040]   An analogy that I often make is
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.360]   when there's a brand new car
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.960]   that comes off the assembly line,
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.280]   you do a full scope of diagnostic workup,
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.840]   hook it up to the computer.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.020]   And I think we should do the same thing
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.500]   with humans as well.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.140]   Dear in puberty, you know,
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.180]   obviously you're a functioning human,
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.160]   but I would say there's still development.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.800]   And I think that the human always develops.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.700]   I don't think development ever ends,
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.560]   but you want to monitor that progress
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.520]   across a person's lifespan.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.520]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.920]   So for blood work, I mean, what would be the earliest,
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.440]   let me put it this way.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.240]   If blood work didn't cost anything
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.480]   and then everyone could get it,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.280]   when would you want to see everybody
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.520]   get their blood work done for the first time?
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.260]   - Obviously individuals under the age of 18
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.300]   should talk with their parents about this.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.660]   And as long as the parents and the child kind of agree
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.240]   and the parents are on board with this as well,
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.300]   you can start getting blood work.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.940]   Often a child will come in with complaints
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.980]   of either precocious puberty or delayed puberty.
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.300]   And this individual might be nine
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.580]   or this individual might be 15.
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.500]   For a healthy child,
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.380]   when they're going through kind of their later tanner stages,
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.280]   which is four and five,
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.120]   so they've developed
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.740]   several secondary sexual characteristics.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.940]   They might have hair growth
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.940]   or starting to notice more beard growth.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.040]   That's a good time to do it.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.740]   If you're concerned with stature or height,
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.200]   or if you're not tracking along
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.320]   where most members of your family have,
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.500]   not just their height and stature,
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.820]   but also the timing of their puberty,
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.480]   then that's time to get lapsed.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.560]   - Great, so if I could travel back in time,
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.820]   I would have gotten my blood work done for hormones
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.400]   and lipids and everything else at 18.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.320]   I unfortunately didn't know where and how to get that.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.360]   And I didn't have any pressing clinical issues.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.320]   And so I think the first time that I got my blood work done,
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.860]   I was in my late twenties, maybe even my early thirties.
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.240]   And I'm still dying to know what my blood work was
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.540]   when for instance, I was 17 and I felt a certain way.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.760]   And I confess that in many dimensions,
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.740]   I actually feel better now at,
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.420]   I'll be 47 soon, at 47 than I did in my teens and twenties.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.140]   And I think it was more on the psychological side.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.300]   I think that, but in terms of just understanding
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.740]   why we felt great or why we felt or feel terrible
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.900]   or not so great, I think blood work is extremely informative.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.720]   What do you think are the key things
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.100]   to look for in blood work?
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.700]   I mean, testosterone is always the topic that comes up
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.580]   in the context of male hormone optimization,
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.960]   but certainly there are a lot of other hormones
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.740]   that are important as well.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.420]   And with testosterone, you want to get either testosterone
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.140]   and an SHBG or a free testosterone.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.380]   Could you define SHBG for our listeners, please?
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.380]   It is sex hormone binding globulin.
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.680]   It is the protein that binds up all androgens
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.300]   and estrogen in the body.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.520]   So the stronger the androgen, the stronger it binds.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.500]   During puberty, strong androgens, especially DHT,
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.580]   which is the strongest bio-identical androgen,
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.660]   has a huge role, a prominent role
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.300]   in secondary sexual characteristics.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.580]   And if your SHBG is very high,
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.260]   then your DHT can run higher because it's not metabolized,
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.460]   but there's not quite as much free DHT.
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:12.300]   So you want to balance between a high enough free DHT
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.300]   and a high enough total DHT.
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.100]   - And obviously these blood tests are going to have
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.100]   to be read and interpreted by a qualified physician.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.640]   Most people aren't going to be in a position
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.500]   to evaluate them properly,
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.260]   or at least not with the full depth that they could
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.340]   if they had an MD like yourself looking at them.
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.100]   Okay, so everyone should get blood work as early as possible,
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.060]   depending on their budget and availability.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.380]   What should everybody do
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.020]   in terms of monitoring those markers?
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.680]   So assuming that there's no major intervention,
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.780]   how often do you recommend
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.840]   that people get their blood work done?
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.020]   - Let's say, let's take an individual who just turned 18.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.740]   They just got their first set of blood work.
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.120]   They'll probably find something in it
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.460]   that they may want to optimize using shared decision-making
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.180]   with their physician.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.860]   Usually a good follow-up is about six months.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.860]   - Okay, so twice a year getting blood work done
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.760]   and having a physician evaluate it.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.820]   That sounds reasonable to me.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.620]   And for those that didn't initiate this at 18,
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.300]   such as myself, it's the best time to start then
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.880]   would be as soon as possible.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.780]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:18.060]   In terms of the other things that all males should do,
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.900]   meaning all males of all ages, puberty and beyond,
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.000]   should do, what are some of those things?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.460]   So on a daily basis,
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.040]   maybe you could just take us through the arc of a day
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.380]   and push out some of the protocols that you use
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.560]   or the things that you'd like to see your male patients use
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.960]   in order to try and optimize their hormone status.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.140]   - I'll briefly touch on some of the lifestyle pillars
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.580]   to start diet and exercise are the first two.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.580]   In puberty, sleep is particularly important, of course.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:50.320]   But with diet and exercise,
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.920]   throughout a lifespan,
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.840]   you want to not exclude things that are helping you.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.900]   For example, during puberty, if you're consuming dairy
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.880]   and then all of a sudden you cut out all dairy,
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.120]   dairy can help increase IGF-1 and free IGF-1.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.080]   - And just for our audience,
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.100]   maybe you just mentioned what having enough IGF-1
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.200]   can do for us that's beneficial is?
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   - It helps you grow.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.960]   It helps with genital development,
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.440]   secondary sexual characteristics, and long bone growth,
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.840]   skin growth, hair growth, a host of things.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.480]   - So getting an array of nutrients that include dairy,
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.200]   what other sorts of nutrients are important
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.240]   during development?
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.320]   - You want to have adequate vitamin D.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.440]   Vitamin D helps with testosterone production.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.440]   It helps, again, with bone mineralization and stature.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:44.120]   After an age of about 25, and there's not a strict cutoff,
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.960]   but up to about an age of 25,
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.140]   optimizing your growth hormone and IGF-1
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.880]   helps with bone density and bone growth.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.060]   So from the dietary standpoint,
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.320]   you want to have enough free estrogen,
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.000]   not too much when you're growing,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.580]   but you want to help basically stockpile bone
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:06.640]   to prevent a risk of osteoporosis or thin bones fractures
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.640]   when you're older.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.880]   - Well, as someone who broke his left foot five times
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.060]   while in high school,
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.360]   I can say whatever young people can do
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.900]   to optimize their bone density would be great.
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.080]   That problem seems to have resolved itself over time,
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.280]   but I don't know, back then I was,
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.760]   I did a short run as a vegetarian,
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.160]   but I've always been an omnivore.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.440]   I realize that some of this relates to ethics
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.160]   and food allergies and things of that sort,
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.780]   but would you say that on balance,
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:36.080]   that most people would benefit from eating a combination
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.360]   of quality proteins from animal sources
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.680]   and non-animal sources, fruits, vegetables,
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.920]   and starches?
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.220]   I mean, what do you think, for instance,
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.500]   about people following a pure carnivore
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:50.500]   or a very pure vegan diet in their 20s and 30s?
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.720]   - In their late 20s, it might be a reasonable option.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.920]   In early 20s and certainly teens,
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.340]   it is a horrible idea because it is likely
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.080]   to significantly decrease your free androgens.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.760]   So you will have less testosterone acting on receptors
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.600]   through the body.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.080]   - Are there any other micronutrients or macronutrients
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.720]   that people in their 20s and 30s should emphasize?
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.800]   - We haven't really touched on fatty acids
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.400]   or fiber too much.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.360]   Fiber is going to be paramount in kind of like
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.920]   setting your set point of your gut microbiome
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.400]   the rest of your life.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.240]   There is prebiotic fiber, which you could think of
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.200]   as fish food for your good gut microbiome.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.480]   Your gut microbiome is kind of like an aquarium
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.300]   or a fish tank.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.280]   - No, I'm just thinking about goldfish swimming around
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.040]   and the goldfish eating people don't eat goldfish people.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:39.880]   - Yup.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.080]   - Live or dead.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.320]   - Yeah, but any fiber or food that you're putting
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.360]   in your gut, it's either going to,
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.440]   it's going to skew your gut microbiome
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.680]   towards something that is more beneficial
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.480]   or more detrimental.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.440]   - And would you say that the prebiotic fiber
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.760]   and getting essential fatty acids,
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.280]   that would be important to do throughout the lifespan
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.320]   or just for people in their 20s and 30s?
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.140]   - Throughout the lifespan, particularly important
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.360]   in the teenage, 20s, 30s,
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.920]   because it helps with brain development.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.000]   You're certainly more of an expert than me
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.720]   when it comes to brain development,
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.120]   but it does continue to develop
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.340]   really throughout the lifespan,
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.760]   but certainly through the 20s and 30s as well.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.420]   - About taking a multivitamin while you're growing up,
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.720]   so many people do that.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.680]   Is it necessary?
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.520]   Is it useful?
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.480]   And if it's not necessary, is it safe to do anyway?
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.840]   - It's generally safe to do anyway.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.000]   I do not think everybody needs a multivitamin.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.760]   The more exclusionary your diet is,
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.640]   for example, if you have celiac disease
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.820]   or if you're planning on fertility soon,
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.480]   then perhaps it's more reasonable to take a multivitamin.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.840]   - In a previous discussion of ours,
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.240]   I asked you about caloric restriction and testosterone.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.840]   And if I recall correctly,
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.140]   the idea was that if somebody is overweight,
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.440]   they have excess fat, adipose tissue,
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.280]   then getting rid of some of that adipose tissue
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.120]   through caloric restriction and exercise,
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.820]   provided it's done not too fast in a healthy way,
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:10.160]   is going to be beneficial for testosterone in the long run.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.100]   But that for individuals who are not carrying
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.240]   an excess of body fat,
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.400]   caloric restriction is actually going to lower testosterone.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.320]   First of all, do I have that correct?
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.620]   And second, are there any addendums to that
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.300]   that you'd like to give us now?
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.880]   - That's correct.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.880]   If you look at an individual in a caloric deficit,
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.440]   several changes will happen.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:37.640]   One is that they'll have less building blocks for hormones.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.920]   Another is that they will be in a catabolic state more often
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.600]   so that balance of anabolism and catabolism
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.760]   will be different.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.340]   They'll likely have less signaling
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.080]   from growth hormone and IGF-1.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.580]   And they'll also have the high SHBG
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.760]   that we defined earlier as the binding protein.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.580]   So there are free androgens
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.840]   and free estrogens will go down.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.680]   - Got it.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.360]   Okay, so we touched on sleep being critical,
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.720]   I would say, throughout the lifespan,
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.360]   trying to get enough quality sleep
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.120]   at least 80% of the nights of your life.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.880]   And the other 20% are just what happens
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.320]   when there's noise outside or you're stressed.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.640]   It just, you have an exam
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.080]   or you're having a great time for whatever reason.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.440]   There are a lot of good reasons
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.560]   to lose some sleep now and again as well.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.020]   But so we have sleep, we've got nutrition,
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.200]   and we touched on that.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.480]   We'll get back into supplementation.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.080]   What are some of the other pillars
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.540]   of creating the proper environment for hormone optimization?
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.920]   - Stress is probably the next one.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:40.760]   During both puberty, but also the 20s and 30s,
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.320]   individuals are figuring out
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.960]   how they want to cope with stress
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.360]   and also figuring out what they want to choose
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.980]   to put their effort into.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.720]   So if someone is overstressed,
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.880]   then they can have,
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.880]   it can put all the other lifestyle pillars
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:58.360]   and then they stop dieting well,
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.880]   they stop exercising and everything else can go askew.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:07.780]   There is also some degree of a social component to this.
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.440]   So perhaps I need to add a seventh pillar of social.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.280]   During your 20s and 30s,
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.600]   you may be forming a family as well.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.920]   Perhaps you have children
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.960]   and the health of the family unit
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.000]   is going to be vitally important.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.840]   Not necessarily directly for hormone optimization,
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.160]   but it's going to throw everything else off if it's off.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.440]   - And for people that are not starting their own families
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.360]   in their 20s and 30s,
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.360]   can that social connection be extended to friendships
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.300]   and work relationships as well?
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.140]   - Absolutely.
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.000]   In fact, if someone's not starting a family,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.840]   it is just as concerning, but for other reasons.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.920]   Each individual is going to have
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   their close group of family and friends.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.940]   And if someone does not have one of those connections,
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.360]   that's when things can potentially get bad,
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.160]   not just for them individually, but also society.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.240]   - So when you say stress,
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.520]   you mean learn to manage your stress.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.640]   What does that look like?
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.580]   I mean, if a patient has high blood pressure,
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.440]   even if they don't, you just sense that they're stressed.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.720]   They have a lot of pressured speech
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.800]   or they're not feeling well
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.940]   or communicating that they're not doing well.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.640]   What are some of the things that you recommend
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.960]   in order to try and ameliorate that stress?
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.440]   - There's different mindfulness or relaxation techniques.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.360]   Going outside can often help with this as well.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.480]   Dietary changes and exercise can help with this too.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.080]   Some people like prayer or meditation,
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.680]   and a lot of people like counseling or therapy,
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.160]   or even just talking openly with a family member or a friend.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.220]   - What would be some of the other pillars
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.400]   for hormone optimization?
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.860]   Here, I feel like we're not just talking about people
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.100]   in their 20s and 30s, but again,
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:47.240]   we're wrapping our arms around basically puberty onward.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.040]   I mean, gosh, looking back,
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.560]   I started meditating pretty early.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.260]   I started weight training and running early.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.960]   I gave some thought to my diet in high school,
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.520]   but really it was in college that I started thinking more
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.280]   about what I was ingesting and why,
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.900]   and trying to do better there.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.640]   But people are coming to the table at different stages
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.000]   of life and trying to optimize for hormones.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.460]   So what would be some of the additional things
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.720]   that everybody should do?
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.380]   - Everyone should get outside
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:18.380]   and find a movement past time to last a lifetime.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.380]   You're gonna get sunlight,
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.300]   you're gonna get some degree of heat and cold exposure,
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.480]   and you're also just gonna move more.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.740]   Being in an artificial environment
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.040]   where there's artificial lights,
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:33.040]   artificial air conditioning is going to have many effects
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.700]   on your body, so that's vital.
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.400]   Another one is finding what your purpose is in life.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.880]   So I call this spirit,
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.540]   but it's really just the self-actualization component
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.700]   of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.000]   which is basically your physical needs,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.940]   your mental needs, and then your purpose in life,
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.080]   what you really like to do.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.580]   - Picking some goal or target.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.260]   And I always say that you don't have to stick
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.300]   to the same goal over time.
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.200]   Certainly I haven't,
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.080]   although I got started early in the science game
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.860]   and I'm still in it.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.580]   The idea is not to pick the end goal,
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.140]   it's to pick a goal.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.340]   And then once you reach that goal to assess
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.100]   and then pick another goal and so on.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.060]   I think sometimes when people hear about picking a purpose,
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.420]   they're like, oh my goodness, I have to define,
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.180]   sort of like naming oneself,
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.600]   that you actually can change your goals
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.220]   and purpose over time.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.060]   This is terrific.
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:25.240]   Would you suggest that people actively use
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.120]   or avoid supplementation
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.080]   prior to doing all these other things?
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.200]   I'm somebody that likes to throw the kitchen sink at things,
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.960]   but I also like to do things pretty systematically.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.580]   So I always say behaviors first, then nutrition,
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.020]   then supplementation, and then maybe,
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.240]   and if and only if there's a real need,
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.860]   and of course, working with a doctor, prescription drugs.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.740]   But there are probably people in their 20s or 30s,
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.320]   maybe even in their 50s that aren't feeling great
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.980]   and they want to do something in order to be able
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.720]   to train more and, or to feel more confident
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.960]   to seek out social connection.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.980]   They try and go about the whole business
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.220]   from the other side as well.
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.340]   What are your thoughts on that?
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.180]   - I see supplements and medications as very similar,
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.100]   one's prescribed and one's not.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.740]   In general, medications have more side effects
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.860]   or potentially stronger therapeutic with more efficacy,
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.860]   but they're just tools to reach an end goal.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.220]   So depending on the goal,
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.300]   if there's an individual that's an athlete,
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.220]   then certainly they should consider supplementation.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.660]   Or if someone desires optimal
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.540]   or a very high level of cognitive performance,
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.600]   they should also consider supplementation.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.300]   At the same time, food is medicine
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.400]   and a lot of the benefits you can get in supplements,
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.820]   you can get in food as well.
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.840]   - Yes, it depends on how much time and energy
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.680]   you're willing to spend.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.160]   Also finances, you know, I know that when I was in college,
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.400]   I could afford just a few supplements
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.160]   and they were basically whey protein and some fish oil.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.780]   I was fortunate that I was pointed in the direction
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.180]   of those things and some creatine.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.100]   I couldn't afford much else.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.700]   Over time, of course, I could afford more,
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.040]   but it really does often depend on finances.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.040]   Before we get into some specific recommendations
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.480]   to optimize testosterone, estrogen,
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.580]   thyroid, growth hormone, et cetera,
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.420]   I want to ask you a question
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.160]   I've been wondering about for a long time.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.680]   You know, so often in the discussion
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.360]   about male hormone optimization,
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.080]   people will say, well, you know,
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.640]   if your libido is suffering, you know,
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.240]   you might want to be concerned about testosterone
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.260]   or even estrogen, right?
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.680]   'Cause we know that estrogen can impact libido as well.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.320]   Sometimes having estrogen too low is detrimental for libido.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.940]   Or people will say, you're not recovering from workouts
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.640]   or you're just, or you're feeling kind of depressed.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.720]   The problem is it's all subjective.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.760]   So how does one know whether or not
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.040]   their recovery from workouts, their energy,
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.640]   their confidence, their libido is within a healthy range?
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.200]   I mean, obviously for people in a relationship,
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.240]   they can know whether or not their libido matches
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.800]   the sort of cadence of the relationship and their partner.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.780]   But how should people think about this?
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.160]   And maybe you can start to talk about it
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.640]   because one of the big differences, I think,
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.120]   between males and females
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.920]   is that because females have a monthly cycle,
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.880]   they are familiar with the changes that occur
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.260]   in their hormones over time.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.360]   Because every 28 days,
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.000]   those hormones are changing dramatically
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.520]   in ways that impact their physiology and psychology.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.720]   But for males, I feel like there's sort of a dearth
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.640]   of language to get into the more subtle aspects of this.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.160]   It also has to do with privacy issues
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.100]   and people feeling like they don't want to overshare
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.880]   too much, not knowing what's appropriate to share.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.360]   But when you talk to a patient who's in their 30s
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.660]   or maybe even their 70s or 60s, doesn't matter,
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.680]   a male patient, what are you listening for?
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.600]   And I know you're not a psychiatrist,
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.560]   but what are your ears tuned to
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.960]   in order to try and figure out whether or not
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.420]   this person could really use some help
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.000]   with hormone optimization or whether or not something else,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.980]   or maybe they're just doing great and they don't realize it
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.620]   because they're placing demands on themselves
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:49.580]   that are excessive?
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.140]   - You want to use a lot of open-ended questions.
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.180]   This process is called motivational interviewing.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.180]   And your goal is to listen to the patient
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:03.960]   and not plant an idea in their mind that they can follow.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.920]   Because everybody is going to have a different goal.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.820]   Some people are better at reading their biofeedback
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.600]   or telling how they feel on a daily basis.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.200]   There is screening questionnaires designed, for example,
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.780]   an ADAM questionnaire to look at men's health
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.700]   and hormone-related health.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.160]   - It's called an ADAM questionnaire?
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.700]   - ADAM questionnaire. - A-D-A-M?
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.140]   - Correct. - Is it available online
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.920]   that people could administer it to themselves?
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.960]   Although we don't want people making clinical diagnoses
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.680]   of themselves or anyone else, is it that sort of exam?
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.020]   - It is. - Interesting.
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.540]   - I don't believe it is a clinically validated tool
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.340]   like an ASCVD, which is like a risk of heart attack
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.820]   and stroke tool or many other tools.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.860]   There's one for depression, there's one for anxiety.
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:49.640]   They're called PHQ-9 and GAD-7 respectively.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:54.640]   But anyway, there's often an in the ADAM questionnaire
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.300]   and what you hear from the patient,
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:01.120]   if you are a very careful listener, is often different.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.720]   - Can you give me an example of some of the questions
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.960]   on this ADAM questionnaire
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.920]   or the sorts of motivational interviewing that you might do?
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.200]   So let's say I'm your patient, we sit down,
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.480]   what sorts of questions would you ask
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.560]   to probe these kinds of dimensions of hormones?
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.180]   - Questions about libido,
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.320]   questions about athletic performance,
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.480]   questions about motivation.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.040]   And often the patient will answer one thing,
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:26.440]   but what you hear from them subjectively is far different.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.280]   - Interesting.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.240]   Can you give me an example of a question?
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.620]   I'm happy to be the guinea pig here.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:36.620]   A classic one is a guy comes in and a lot of times they say,
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:39.000]   "Oh, no, the wife made me go to the doctor."
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.680]   I go, "Once a year, that's it, I don't want anything.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.680]   "I don't want any medications."
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.500]   Their screening questionnaires might be zeros
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.680]   across the board, so nothing, no issues.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.780]   They're apparently in perfect health.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.640]   They talk to you for a while, they get some rapport,
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.680]   they like you and then right as you're finishing up the visit
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.540]   and about to go out the room,
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.880]   they mentioned that their libido isn't quite there
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.000]   and they're having a little bit of ED as well
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.240]   and perhaps are even having some chest pressure tightness.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.080]   - I see.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.760]   So right as you're leaving the room,
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.640]   a patient will tell you
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.880]   that they're having some sexual side effects
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.720]   or not side effects,
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.520]   they're having some sexual challenges
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.960]   and then they'll mention chest pressure.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.200]   Is the chest pressure a sort of general decoy
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.680]   for it's got to be my heart
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.080]   or is it related to the other things they're reporting?
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.240]   - It can be related.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.780]   In fact, erectile dysfunction is known as the canary
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.100]   in the coal mine.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.000]   So coal miners would take the canary down
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.040]   and the canary would die before the coal miners would have,
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.520]   I believe, carbon monoxide poisoning.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.720]   And often one of the causes of ED is plaque buildup,
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.900]   which can happen in the coronaries as well,
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.160]   but sometimes they notice the symptom in the genitals
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.880]   before they do in the coronaries.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.800]   - So for such a patient,
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.760]   let's say that patient was a young person
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.740]   where plaque buildup in the arteries and veins
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.600]   is not all that likely if they're,
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.720]   let's say in their 20s or 30s,
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.280]   what would be your next step of the interview at that point
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.400]   and what would you consider?
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.480]   Would you immediately order labs for that person
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.040]   to try and rule out any kind of
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.480]   actual hormone level deficiency?
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.680]   - I certainly would order labs.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.840]   There are some individuals that are very similar
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.880]   and they come in and they have the same symptoms
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.400]   and one individual might have a very, very high testosterone
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.960]   and one individual might be severely hypogonadal.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.760]   So there's a big difference between the subjective
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.260]   and what the labs look like.
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.320]   So I certainly order labs.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.560]   You also ask them about if it's situational or not.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.800]   You ask them if they have ED,
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.380]   if they're, you know, you ask them about their habits.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.980]   You even ask about porn and masturbation
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:42.960]   and all these issues.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.480]   And of course it's between the doctor and the patient.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.040]   And depending on what they tell you,
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:51.240]   you can often determine if there is a situational component.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.720]   Some people call it it's psychogenic ED,
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.100]   but I don't love the term psychogenic ED
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:01.100]   because it kind of puts some blame on the patient's mind.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.280]   But a lot of the time that is the case.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.920]   There's even a test and this is very rarely ordered,
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:10.000]   but it's called a nocturnal penile tumescence.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.200]   - Yeah, because is it true that there are
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.440]   periodic erections during sleep, correct?
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.280]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.920]   - So you basically put a cuff to see
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.040]   if you were having a normal sized erection during sleep.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.600]   And I believe about 90% of the time they do that test,
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.480]   they are indeed having erections.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.320]   - Which would point to this psychogenic origin
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.480]   of whatever challenges they're having
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.880]   in terms of sexual interactions.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.660]   You mentioned porn and masturbation.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:40.560]   This topic has come up a bunch of times on this podcast
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.920]   and on other podcasts I've gone on
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.600]   because of the relationship between dopamine,
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:47.920]   sexual motivation and sexual behavior.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.400]   And I've been of the pretty strong stance
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.680]   that while I'm not judging porn or masturbation,
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.800]   it can create a brain wiring situation
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.860]   where males in particular essentially teach their brain
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.540]   to be aroused by watching other people have sex
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.380]   as opposed to being the first person actor
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.440]   in sexual interactions.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:13.000]   So in that sense, that's more about the brain wiring
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.680]   and neuroplasticity and dopamine,
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.120]   but what are your thoughts on porn and masturbation
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.280]   as they relate to hormones?
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.080]   I mean, this is a big debate on the internet.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.340]   In fact, one of the most common debates
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:24.940]   is whether or not masturbation increases
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.240]   or decreases testosterone in males.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:29.920]   Certainly it will decrease motivation
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.920]   to go find sexual partners.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.880]   We know this and there are more and more data
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.360]   on this all the time.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.680]   In terms of the effects of pornography and masturbation,
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.560]   and here I suppose we need to be somewhat specific
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.220]   and operationally define what we're talking about.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.640]   We're talking about porn and masturbation
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.740]   to the point of ejaculation, right?
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:54.000]   Because my understanding is that the ejaculation
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.760]   and orgasm associated with it
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.080]   cause an increase in prolactin,
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.560]   which blunts libido for some period of time.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.880]   The duration of that will vary from person to person
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.620]   and circumstance to circumstance.
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.800]   But basically all of this points to the fact
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:10.000]   that porn and masturbation can really limit libido
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.840]   in the real world.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.800]   And to me, pornography and the screen is not the real world.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.520]   The screens exist in the real world,
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.200]   the real world doesn't exist in the screen.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.520]   - That's an accurate statement.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:26.520]   And prolactin does have a significant acute increase
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.440]   after ejaculation.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.120]   It does to some degree after orgasm as well,
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.800]   but prolactin acts on the pituitary
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.720]   to inhibit the release of the hormones LH and FSH,
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.800]   of which LH can increase testosterone.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.780]   So this may be one of the cases
[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.440]   where the dose makes the poison.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.200]   And if it is a very frequent habit,
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.240]   certainly daily or more than once a day
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.800]   would be very detrimental from a hormonal component,
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.840]   not even taking into account the neural wiring.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.840]   - Listen, I think it's terrific
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.320]   that you've actually defined frequency
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.920]   because this is the problem on the internet
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.520]   or even in the doctor's office,
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.920]   you'll see descriptions about pornography
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.800]   being dangerous for certain things
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.240]   or detrimental to hormones.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.800]   People say frequent, but what's frequent?
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.000]   So you were saying daily or multiple times per day
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.740]   would be potentially detrimental to the hormone profile
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.660]   of a male of essentially any age.
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.440]   - And that's just for masturbation.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:27.980]   With pornography, with porn use as well,
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.240]   it would likely be worse.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.280]   - Why is that?
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.500]   Just the sort of dopaminergic drive of the stimulus,
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.100]   just the really intense visual stimulus?
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.100]   - Dopamine sensitivity.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.140]   I think that using the analogy of a dopamine wave pool,
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.700]   it would deepen the pool,
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.660]   but not increase your supply of dopamine.
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.260]   - Maybe you could describe the dopamine wave pool
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.980]   'cause I think it's such a powerful way
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.060]   of thinking about dopamine and what dopamine does.
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:56.600]   In fact, I've always credited you when I've done it,
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.600]   but I've generally stolen your analogy
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.340]   of the dopamine wave pool because it's so astute.
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.900]   - The dopamine wave pool describes the natural variation
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:10.380]   of ups and downs in your dopamine or your motivation.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:15.380]   And in the wave pool, depending on how high the peak is,
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:20.220]   you often have a deeper trough.
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.400]   So you do not want too high of a peak.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.660]   In addition, if your peak is very, very high,
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:30.100]   for example, when you're using many substances
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.580]   like cocaine or like amphetamines,
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.440]   your dopamine can go so high,
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.140]   you lose almost all the water from the wave pool.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.340]   And then when you crash from that,
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.060]   not only is the trough low,
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:43.500]   you have less dopamine in the pool to begin with.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.960]   The dopamine receptor is extremely sensitive
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.880]   as is the GABA receptor, which is an inhibitory receptor.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.000]   Whereas dopamine is technically a stimulant
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.080]   more related to adrenaline and noradrenaline.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:58.040]   The depth of the pool can change very quick.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.600]   So you wanna have that happy medium
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.480]   where you're fairly near the top,
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:03.280]   but you're not so near the top
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.060]   that the depth of the pool is going to go down.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:10.520]   - So if I interpret that in the context of this discussion
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:14.860]   about libido sex, porn and masturbation,
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:18.180]   if somebody has a very intense sexual experience,
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.520]   and here we're not necessarily
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.900]   talking about an intense orgasm,
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.740]   we're talking about just a lot of intense visual,
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:29.740]   so a lot of intense imagery or auditory input or both,
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:32.180]   that is going to lead to a situation
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.780]   where dopamine is going to be depleted afterwards.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:35.620]   - Correct.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.760]   - A guest on this podcast before my colleague at Stanford,
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.600]   Dr. Anna Lemke, who's an expert in addiction,
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.900]   talked a bit about this, this sort of seesawing.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:42.900]   Here we're talking about a wave
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.100]   and a crashing out of the water from the wave pool there.
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.920]   It was a seesawing from pleasure and pain.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.040]   There's going to be a longer and deeper period
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.480]   of lack of pleasure following that.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.520]   And I think a lot of people think, oh, well, that's great.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.240]   They want the intense experience.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.840]   But if that intense experience is coming
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.280]   from pornography and masturbation,
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.980]   or I suppose coming from high adrenaline activities
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.220]   like life-risking parkour
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.060]   hanging off the side of a building,
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.080]   it inevitably is going to lead to depressive episodes,
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.720]   low libido episodes that follow, is that right?
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.780]   - Correct, in a similar physiologic way
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:21.800]   to withdrawal from stimulants like amphetamines.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:25.480]   - Now, is sex with a partner different?
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.420]   Because there are many people who are chasing
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.120]   more and more intense experiences with a partner
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.200]   as opposed to through pornography and masturbation.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.520]   Again, here we're talking about all ages.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.360]   And I should always say,
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.660]   anytime we're talking about sex with a partner,
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.080]   we're talking, you know, the four conditions
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:43.180]   that I always lay out on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.800]   are that we're talking about consensual, age-appropriate,
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.040]   context-appropriate, species-appropriate interactions.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.640]   - Yeah, and this is also a case
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.940]   where the dose makes the poison.
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.240]   So if there's, you know,
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.200]   obviously meeting all those criteria,
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:04.200]   if they have one preference that for both of them
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.220]   is a positive experience, then that is likely okay.
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:12.480]   You're not gonna be able to maintain dopamine
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.880]   over a certain threshold for a long period of time.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:18.560]   So there very well may be a crash from that experience
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.600]   as well, and the crash may be different
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.080]   in one partner than the other.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.040]   - Interesting.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.600]   Oh, I'll draw an analogy to food.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.960]   It'd be like, you know, you don't have to serve
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.360]   a banquet meal seven nights of the week, maybe just two.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.200]   Is that right?
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.240]   And there are other delicious foods out there.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.400]   Can we use that analogy?
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.680]   - That is very reasonable.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.080]   - Okay, not trying to be PG-13,
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.020]   just trying to, parsimony, Occam's razor,
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:46.300]   the ability to describe a lot of things in a few words.
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:50.520]   I'd like to return to the key things that people should do,
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.640]   or I should say the key things that men should do
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:53.720]   to optimize their hormones.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.080]   So we talked about getting some movement,
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.600]   getting some sunlight, getting quality social connection,
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.960]   one way or the other.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.800]   Avoid excessively frequent masturbation
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.040]   and viewing pornography.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.300]   And for some people, zero might be the optimal number.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.880]   And I keep coming back to this for most people.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:10.720]   Interesting.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.740]   I feel so fortunate to have grown up prior
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.720]   to the availability of internet pornography.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.680]   I've never been a big consumer of pornography.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.220]   I've just not been my thing.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:21.760]   But I hear so often from males of all ages
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.680]   about their addiction to it, their affliction by it.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.800]   It's really a serious issue.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.340]   And that's one of the reasons why I'm grateful
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.600]   that you're willing to talk about this
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.160]   and your clinical experience with these patients.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.560]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.600]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.060]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.440]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.320]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.000]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.240]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.820]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.900]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.880]   once or usually twice a day
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.480]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.600]   Our gut is very important.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.140]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.900]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:06.300]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.940]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.800]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.640]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.800]   In addition, Athletic Greens
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.100]   contains a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.720]   that make sure that all of my foundational nutritional needs
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.440]   are met and it tastes great.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:25.880]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:29.280]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.260]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.560]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.160]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.560]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:42.240]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.620]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:46.640]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.440]   In terms of exercise, you know, here's, again,
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.280]   it's a double-edged sword.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.920]   On the one hand, it's great to get exercise,
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:56.680]   but I'm familiar with, you know, if I train an hour a day,
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.700]   you know, 10 minutes of warmup
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.880]   and 50 minutes to an hour of weight training
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:02.320]   or 50 minutes to an hour of cardio, I feel great,
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.560]   especially if once a week I take a complete day off.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.120]   That's sort of my general schedule.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.600]   I'm also familiar with when I go out
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.340]   for runs that are excessively long, two-hour runs,
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.200]   or I spend 90 minutes in the gym too frequently,
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.720]   I start to feel like garbage.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.560]   Everything suffers.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.600]   My sleep starts to suffer.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.280]   It doesn't matter how much I eat.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.460]   I don't seem to recover.
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:21.760]   I don't feel well.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.760]   - So I realize that recovery ability
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.240]   varies between individuals,
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.520]   but what do you think is a healthy,
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:32.200]   sustainable exercise regimen that anyone can follow
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.640]   that will also support their hormone status?
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.840]   - For really vigorous exercise,
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.920]   around three to four times a week is very sustainable
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.000]   over a long period of time.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   On top of that, you could add in three or four more instances
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.920]   of less vigorous exercise.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.800]   - Okay, so for less vigorous, what do you mean that,
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.480]   you know, zone two cardio where you can hold a conversation,
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.240]   but beyond which you can't, and for more vigorous,
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.760]   you're thinking weight training
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.600]   or high intensity interval type training.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.420]   Is that right?
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:02.260]   - Correct.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.560]   You can also weight train and have some benefit,
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.280]   even at a low to moderate intensity.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.520]   If you think about weight training where you have,
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.200]   and it's not necessarily related to the incidence of DOMS,
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.720]   which is delayed onset muscle soreness,
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:20.800]   but if you weight train lazy or easy from time to time,
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.600]   obviously you want to weight train very heavy
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.540]   from time to time as well
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.880]   because of more lean body mass growth.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.480]   But if you weight train lighter,
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.320]   you're going to be able to do it more often,
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:37.280]   and it can still help with the hypertrophy of collagen,
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.900]   for example, in tendons and ligaments.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:43.880]   - So here again, like to perhaps drill into this notion
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.280]   of intensity and lightweights,
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.480]   because for me, some of the most brutal workouts
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:49.660]   I've ever done were in what I would consider
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:51.680]   a high repetition range, 15 to 50.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.960]   Actually, I went up to Oregon
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.400]   to watch the international track and field championships.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   We went by Cameron Hanes' place, the Cameron Hanes,
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.520]   and he and his trainer put us through a workout
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.720]   that was 25 to 50 repetitions per set,
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.580]   and it was done in circuit and it was brutal.
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:09.720]   So it was light.
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.020]   I mean, those weights were nothing.
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:13.680]   In some cases it was body weight,
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.720]   but the number of repetitions was brutal.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:17.880]   So when you say limiting intensity,
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.500]   are you talking about limiting the number of sets
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.340]   to failure?
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:24.920]   Are you talking about really being kind of a lazy bear
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.760]   in the gym?
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.680]   I like to do that every once in a long, long rest,
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.240]   that sort of thing.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.640]   What are your thoughts on that
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.500]   as it relates to hormone optimization?
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:35.160]   So I'll just mention, and then I'll let you answer.
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:38.120]   I feel best overall when I'm training
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.880]   for 10 minute warmups and about 45 or 50 minutes
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.560]   of weight training where I'm pretty lazy between sets
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.560]   two to three minute rest,
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.200]   training somewhere in the six to 10 rep range,
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.820]   going to failure every once in a while,
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.640]   but mostly getting that sort of last rep
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.000]   before what I would think is failure,
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.720]   no forced reps, that kind of thing.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.840]   And then jogging on the other days, nice and easy.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.920]   When I do that, I feel fantastic
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.580]   in all other dimensions of life.
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.700]   When I train more intensely than that,
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:08.700]   even with lightweight, so faster cadence and lower rest,
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.080]   I feel like garbage.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.880]   I get a headache, I'm kind of ornery,
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.340]   everything suffers.
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.120]   So what are your thoughts on kind of
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:19.960]   defining a optimal exercise strategy for hormones?
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.020]   I've never measured my hormones
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.000]   in those two different contexts,
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.840]   but I have to imagine that it's cortisol related.
[00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.520]   - When they study the effect of exercise,
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.920]   specifically vigorous exercise,
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.120]   one area that's been studied is
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:36.160]   vigorous exercise episodes lasting longer than an hour.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:39.960]   And they usually track it by a rating of perceived exertion,
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.680]   which isn't perfect and it's not extremely actionable,
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.480]   but it's helpful for clinical science.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.900]   But the takeaway from that is basically do not,
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:52.640]   it is not hormonally helpful to train,
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.960]   especially regularly train vigorously
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.840]   for longer than an hour.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.740]   - Great, so I'm happy to hear that
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:01.160]   because it sounds like for most people,
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.840]   that hour of work is really the threshold.
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.560]   I think this is important for people to hear,
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.000]   especially males, because I think
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.200]   with all of the incredible examples out there
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.640]   of people like Cam, like David Goggins,
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.360]   people who are training for very long periods of time,
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:19.040]   you know, and leaving aside all issues
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.960]   of what people are doing in order to optimize their recovery,
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.920]   I think an hour a day of exercise is just a great program
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.160]   that most anyone can follow.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.240]   And beyond an hour, you start running into challenges.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.360]   And I, you know, the occasional 90 minute
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.720]   or two hour workout is no big deal.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.920]   But if you start doing that more than once every
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.960]   two months, I think you're headed for trouble.
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:45.000]   Have you seen that in people's blood work
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.240]   and in their hormones?
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.560]   Do you ever see people that are just badly over-trained
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.880]   because they're just training too hard and too often?
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:55.200]   - Yes, when the blood work is particularly bad,
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:59.320]   they're often in a large caloric deficit as well.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:03.480]   There's a synergistic effect between a caloric deficit.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.940]   Even if you're maintaining adequate protein intake,
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:08.640]   you might not be maintaining adequate iron intake
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.040]   or adequate vitamin D.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.720]   And you're also just literally in a caloric deficit,
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.920]   perhaps low carbs as well, very low free testosterone.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.920]   And they're simultaneously doing a lot of vigorous exercise.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.200]   - Interesting.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.080]   I often hear, and I'm starting to wonder whether or not
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:32.080]   some of the quicker to result nutrition tactics,
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:36.260]   things like dropping all carbohydrates,
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:39.820]   or the quicker to result exercise habits,
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.000]   like starting to do six day a week, really intense workouts,
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.180]   whether or not in the short run they work
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.920]   because they cause the cosmetic changes
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:48.140]   that people are seeking,
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.920]   but that they really undermine the overall goal,
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:54.840]   which is, at least to me, to have your hormones,
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.500]   maybe not optimized to the 100%,
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.700]   but to always be aiming for 100% and be close to it
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:02.440]   at every stage of life.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.540]   - Consistency is key here.
[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:07.880]   If you are not consistent, then the law of diminishing
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.620]   returns certainly applies.
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:14.620]   So 80 or 90% of the benefit over many, many months
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:20.540]   is far better than 100%, but only half the time.
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:23.440]   - Yeah, one thing that I've found to be tremendously useful
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.880]   is to finish the workout while I still have energy,
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.920]   to not take myself to exhaustion.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.600]   And then I'm able to kind of talk about
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:31.560]   the dopamine wave pool.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.120]   I'm able to sort of ride that into the rest of the day,
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:34.960]   feeling great.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:39.200]   I sort of save or bank some of the vigor from the training
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.240]   to bring it into my work.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.600]   But then again, I'm not an athlete.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.320]   I get paid to think and to speak,
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.940]   not to lift weights or to run.
[00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:47.800]   - Another component of that is the balance
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.400]   between your sympathetic,
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.320]   which is your fight or flight nervous system,
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.560]   and your parasympathetic,
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.400]   which is your rest or digest nervous system.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.880]   There is an anecdote which is likely true
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:02.200]   that many elite bodybuilders are very parasympathetic
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.040]   besides while they're lifting weights.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.840]   - You mean they're lazy and they like to eat a lot.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:06.680]   - Yeah.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.320]   - The lazy bear in the gym kind of phenomenon.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.200]   - Absolutely.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.800]   But that being said, after a very, very vigorous workout,
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:15.820]   for example, one where you're trained to failure,
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:18.880]   which bodybuilders and power lifters do all the time,
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:23.880]   you feel the tiredness or you feel the strain
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.040]   from that heavy sympathetic activity
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.060]   when you are lifting a heavy weight.
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:31.320]   And it can potentially affect
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.760]   how you feel the rest of the day.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:36.040]   So many people who have a job where
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.480]   that is highly cognitive do not like to have
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.640]   an extremely vigorous workout in the morning,
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.600]   which is when a lot of people are able to exercise.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.160]   - When I exercise early in the morning,
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.960]   that is before 9 a.m., I have more energy all day long.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:48.940]   If I do it mid-morning,
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.000]   I have experienced more of an afternoon crash.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.720]   There's probably some circadian biology in there.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:56.760]   I've also noticed, and I've actually seen in my blood work,
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:00.080]   that if I don't get out for a 45-minute jog
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.880]   at least once a week, all of my blood profiles suffer
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.800]   in the direction that I don't want them to go.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.920]   In particular, testosterone and estrogen move
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.560]   in directions that are not conducive to my goals.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:15.040]   I'd like to talk about some of the approaches
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.360]   that people can use in order to optimize hormones.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:20.200]   And these days, for better or for worse,
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   I think for worse, younger guys are asking about
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:29.240]   and using testosterone replacement therapy, so-called TRT.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.920]   And I just want to frame this up by saying
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:33.240]   there is no strict cutoff for what is TRT.
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:36.240]   There are plenty of people whose blood levels
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:37.440]   of testosterone and estrogen
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.280]   are within the normal reference range
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.040]   and decide to start doing these things.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:42.400]   Of course, they can limit fertility.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.240]   There are a bunch of issues, even at non-quote-unquote
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:49.240]   steroidal performance-enhancing dosages.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:51.440]   I'd love to frame this up by first defining our terms,
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.480]   because one of the challenges on the internet
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.720]   is people talk about TRT,
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.400]   then they'll talk about performance-enhancing drugs,
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.600]   they'll talk about steroids.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.220]   They're all steroids, right?
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:02.600]   I mean, testosterone, estrogen are both steroid hormones,
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.680]   but what one considered replacement therapy
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.760]   versus what one considers performance-enhancing
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.360]   is going to depend, right?
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.380]   So here's my question.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:17.360]   Why in the world, why in the world
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:22.360]   would any male in his teens or 20s or even 30s
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:26.520]   whose blood levels of testosterone and estrogen
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.760]   are at the appropriate levels,
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:29.560]   meaning within the normal reference range,
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:33.660]   why would they take exogenous testosterone
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:36.880]   given all the negative effects on fertility,
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.520]   some of the challenges that it can present
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:40.880]   if the dosages aren't quite right, et cetera,
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.120]   why would they do that?
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:45.280]   Certainly if they are not being paid
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.240]   for a particular endeavor, like they're not making money.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.160]   If they are playing a sport,
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.860]   chances are they're not allowed to do that anyway.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:53.240]   It's on the banned substances list.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.760]   So to me, it just seems like a crazy idea.
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:58.480]   But then again, I'm of a generation
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.800]   that really hasn't thought about doing that stuff
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.760]   until people were in their 40s and 50s or even never.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.400]   So is there ever a case for somebody in their 20s or 30s
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.480]   to take testosterone, if their blood levels
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.960]   are within the 300 to 900 nanograms
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.680]   per deciliter reference range?
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.280]   - Not many cases.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.160]   The reason for any performance-enhancing drug,
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.740]   whether or not it is a steroid synthetic bio-identical
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:27.880]   or otherwise, it varies a lot.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.960]   Some individuals do it only for cosmetic reasons,
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.560]   even if it can have deleterious effects
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.600]   on the cosmetic appearance, for example,
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.760]   of your skin in the long run.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.520]   But everyone has their different reason
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:49.480]   as far as when does the benefit outweigh the detriment?
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.080]   Not very often if you're in your 20s,
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.960]   and certainly probably almost hardly never.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.840]   There's always rare cases like Kalman syndrome and whatnot,
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.440]   but almost never if you were very young.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.020]   - Okay, so for people in their 20s, 30s, and beyond,
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:08.960]   40s, et cetera, whose testosterone and estrogen levels
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.720]   are at the appropriate ratios
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.500]   and within the normal reference range,
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:14.920]   and they feel pretty good, right?
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.240]   We talked about the ADAMS exam,
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.540]   where they sort of like feel pretty good
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:21.340]   as sort of code for libido, energy, recovery, et cetera,
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:26.340]   are feeling at least workable for their lifestyle.
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:31.640]   For those people, what can they do besides get great sleep,
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.220]   train but not too hard or too often, et cetera, et cetera?
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.620]   What are some of the things in the realm of supplementation
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:40.620]   that can help them optimize their testosterone and estrogen
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:44.360]   without suppressing their own endogenous production
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.620]   of testosterone and estrogen?
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.060]   - Let's mention creatine as the first one.
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.520]   Creatine is interesting because it has multiple different
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.320]   effects that helps with amino acid synthesis.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.840]   It also helps with oxidative stress.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.080]   It can also serve as the backup fuel tank
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.120]   for your mitochondria.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.560]   So kind of holding back up ATP,
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.760]   and it does slightly increase total testosterone,
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.400]   and it also increases the conversion of testosterone
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.340]   to dihydrotestosterone.
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:14.280]   So potentially it's especially useful in men
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.640]   in even their teenage years and their 20s.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.280]   - You mentioned the conversion of testosterone
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.460]   to dihydrotestosterone, and there is mythology out there
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:24.140]   that creatine can increase hair loss.
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.540]   I'm guessing because there's at least one study showing
[01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:29.760]   that creatine can increase DHT, dihydrotestosterone,
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.920]   and DHT is one of the primary hormones
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.680]   that can promote male pattern baldness.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.260]   So the question therefore is,
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:43.040]   does creatine supplementation increase the rate of hair loss?
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.080]   - Theoretically it can, but in each individual,
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:53.480]   preventing hair loss is a very poor reason
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.640]   to take creatine because it's not going to take you
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.440]   to a supra physiologic level.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:03.040]   It's not going to increase your androgens
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.840]   to an unnormal level of binding.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.320]   So I feel like if that was a reason to not take creatine
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.420]   for hair loss, then that's-
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.400]   - Sorry, you mean hair loss is not a reason
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.260]   to avoid taking creatine?
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.120]   - Correct, hair loss is not a reason
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.500]   to avoid taking creatine.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.920]   Think of it as just bringing you
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:27.600]   to what you are naturally inclined to have.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.420]   If your conversion of testosterone to DHT is already high,
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.580]   then often creatine does not affect this.
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.640]   It just kind of resets your balance
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.860]   between testosterone being aromatized to estrogen
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.980]   or being five alpha reduced DHT.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:44.640]   So it's not going to speed up hair loss
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:48.000]   more than just naturally being a male does.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.760]   So in some individuals, it will have no effect.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.840]   In some individuals, for whatever reason,
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.560]   they have almost no five alpha reductase activity.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:58.080]   It will return them to natural or normal.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:58.900]   - I see.
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:01.560]   Well, I take five grams a day of creatine monohydrate.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.360]   I do it for the tissue volumizing effects,
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.200]   for exercise benefits, but also for the cognitive effects.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.040]   I don't know if it's increasing my hair loss.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:10.880]   I mean, I've got a little bit
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.360]   of sort of a widow's peak type hair loss.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.660]   That's where it is for me.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:18.780]   I suppose beard growth is associated with DHT too.
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:20.020]   Is that right?
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:21.420]   What I learned, but then again,
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:23.140]   I haven't been into this literature in a long time,
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:25.920]   is that because of differences in receptors
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.320]   that DHT causes hair growth on the face
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.660]   and hair loss on the head.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:30.640]   Is that right?
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.200]   - Yes, and the amount and the sensitivity
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:37.440]   and density of those receptors is genetically determined.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.560]   - And is it true that if your mother's father was bald,
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.420]   that you will be bald in the same pattern
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.440]   and if that he wasn't, you won't?
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.760]   - That is a decent correlation.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.680]   Part of the proposed mechanism of this,
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.880]   well, there are several genes
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.600]   and you can actually test your genes for hair loss.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.320]   You do get a decent amount of them from your mother.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.240]   The unique thing you get from your mother
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.620]   that she may have gotten from her father,
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:02.360]   that she got one of the copies from her father
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.920]   is your X chromosome.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.560]   And the androgen receptor gene is on your X chromosome.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:11.480]   So all men got their androgen receptor gene
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.840]   from their mother.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.320]   - It's on their X chromosome, not on the Y chromosome.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.200]   - Correct.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.040]   - Interesting.
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.220]   Even though all of the sort of quote unquote,
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:23.440]   male promoting genes are on the Y chromosome,
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.460]   like malaria and inhibiting, et cetera.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:26.440]   Interesting.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.000]   Okay, so five grams a day of creatine for most people
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.320]   should be fine, beneficial for tissue voluminizing,
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.160]   so strength, bringing water into the muscles
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.860]   and for the cognitive effects
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:39.660]   and the clinical support of creatine,
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:42.800]   I think is quite strong at the five gram per day dosage.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.980]   What other sorts of supplements can people benefit from?
[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.680]   We already talked about the omegas
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.080]   and making sure that people are getting enough
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:54.040]   prebiotic fiber to support the gut microbiome and vitamin D.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:58.360]   So what other supplement-based tools can people consider?
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.040]   - Another one we can loop in with creatine is betaine.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.440]   Some people are non-responders to creatine,
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:06.000]   so you can increase that to 10 grams
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.920]   or you can use its cousin betaine
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:12.320]   to help with amino acid synthesis and shunting of energy.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.160]   Along with that, I would put L-carnitine,
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.300]   which is actually the smallest peptide hormone.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.820]   It's just two amino acids that are put together.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:21.660]   So it's a-
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.080]   - It's a hormone.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.080]   Interesting.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:24.920]   I'm not challenging it.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.740]   - Peptide.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:26.580]   - Yeah, I'm not challenging.
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:29.200]   - I would call it a peptide more than a hormone.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.880]   So I would not call L-carnitine a hormone,
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.840]   but I would call dopamine a hormone.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:34.880]   - Yeah, I could.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.920]   A neurohormone, it's so hard to define things
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.920]   as transmitters or hormones at some level.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.760]   I agree.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.600]   So L-carnitine, actually, I should backtrack.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.520]   Betaine, do you recall what dosage
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.000]   people typically would take
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.400]   if they're a creatine non-responder?
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.880]   - One to three grams.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.000]   In fact, yeah.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.120]   Several versions of creatine have betaine mixed in
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.020]   because it helps with the processing
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:00.880]   of methionine and homocysteine.
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.080]   - So if somebody is already taking creatine
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.680]   and likes it and responds to it,
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.580]   I'll raise my hand, such as myself,
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.600]   would adding betaine help
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.040]   or is it redundant with creatine?
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.740]   - Only if their homocysteine is persistently elevated.
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:16.240]   And homocysteine is kind of like an inflammatory marker
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.320]   that can build up if you're not converting
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.780]   enough of it down the stream.
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.360]   - How would I know?
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.520]   - Just a blood test.
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.360]   - Okay.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.880]   - Or if you knew your MTHFR polymorphism,
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:29.840]   which is basically how you add methyl groups
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.280]   to many things in the body.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.120]   - Great.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.360]   Any side effects of betaine that people should be aware of?
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.280]   - Not that I know of.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.100]   - Okay.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:38.940]   People can look it up.
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.620]   And on examine.com is a great site for that.
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:41.700]   They'll surely list it.
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.280]   They just revamped their site, by the way.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.920]   And it was awesome before and it's platinum now.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:51.760]   So L-carnitine, what are the ways to take L-carnitine?
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.040]   I know that there's an oral form, so capsules,
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.040]   and there's injectables.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.200]   The injectables, I think you need a prescription.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.040]   Is that right?
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:58.860]   - Correct.
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.280]   You need a prescription for the injectables,
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.980]   or you should really get a prescription for the injectables.
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.660]   When you inject it, of course,
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:08.140]   at the supervision of your doctor,
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.040]   it's usually done intramuscularly.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.860]   It's an aqueous solution.
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.360]   So it does not have like an oil or a carrier oil in it,
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.700]   like testosterone esters do.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:20.840]   However, if you inject it too superficially,
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.360]   it's not going to make or rake anything.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.600]   Often it just burns if you inject it subcutaneously.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.400]   And it does not disseminate throughout the body as well.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:32.940]   L-carnitine potentially has localized effects
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:34.460]   if you inject it.
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.740]   If you ingest it orally,
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:40.780]   then it has a very low bioavailability, maybe only 10%.
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:42.300]   - Well, I think most people are going to be able
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:46.260]   to get L-carnitine only in its capsule form.
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:47.960]   So what are the dosages of L-carnitine
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.140]   that one needs to ingest then if they want to get a benefit?
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.900]   Because if only 10% is being absorbed,
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:56.420]   that's probably a lot of L-carnitine.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.140]   How much should people take per day?
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.800]   - Usually I recommend for oral L-carnitine
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.700]   between 1,000 milligrams and up to four or 5,000 milligrams.
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:08.800]   - So one to four, maybe even five grams.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.040]   - Correct, up to five grams a day.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.340]   If you're on that much,
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:16.020]   especially if you have a dysregulated gut microbiome,
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.900]   you should be concerned with TMAO,
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:19.600]   which is a potential carcinogen
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.260]   that both carnitine and choline can convert into.
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:27.420]   And your gut microbiota determine how much that happens.
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:29.820]   - Is it true that I can offset any negative effects
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:34.420]   of alpha-GPC-choline, that is NL-carnitine,
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.340]   that I take by ingesting garlic, is that right?
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.860]   - There's a compound in garlic called allicin.
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.180]   I believe it's A-L-L-I-C-I-N.
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:43.720]   It's also part of the scientific name,
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.980]   the genus of types of garlic.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:49.980]   And this can help decrease the conversion to TMAO.
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:51.780]   Berberine actually slightly decreases
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:54.180]   the conversion to TMAO as well,
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.740]   probably through alteration of the gut microbiome.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:59.340]   And then just optimizing your gut microbiome
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:00.340]   can decrease conversion.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:02.460]   So not everyone needs allicin,
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:04.380]   but it's something that you should certainly consider
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.500]   if you were on a high dose.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:10.420]   - I'm going to continue to take the 600 milligrams of garlic
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:12.060]   every time I take my L-carnitine,
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:13.380]   but I'm going to skip the berberine
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:15.020]   'cause berberine gives me brutal headaches
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.500]   and it makes me crave carbohydrates
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.980]   because it drops my blood sugar.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:20.900]   - It has many other effects, including the DAWN phenomenon,
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:22.760]   where it drops your blood sugar when you're sleeping
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.240]   and you can't even realize it.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.040]   - I am not a fan of berberine,
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.340]   and I'm sorry for those of you that are.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.660]   I'm not trying to offend anyone,
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.580]   although frankly, if you're being offended
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.580]   by my stance on berberine,
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.720]   then maybe we should have another discussion.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.220]   In any case, injectable L-carnitine,
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:39.720]   if one can get that through a doctor,
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:43.800]   how much is absorbed and how much should one take?
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.040]   - Almost all of it's absorbed.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:49.280]   In general, you're taking between 500 milligrams up to,
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:52.320]   you can take a pretty high dose, up to 2000 milligrams.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.640]   - Okay, and what we did not talk about
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.500]   is what L-carnitine does.
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:59.020]   So why should someone go through all of this?
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.780]   Is it to optimize testosterone?
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.340]   Is it working on the receptor side?
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.440]   What's L-carnitine doing?
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.420]   - It's a shuttle.
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:10.960]   So I think it's named carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.400]   Basically, it just takes nutrients
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.340]   from outside your mitochondria and puts them in.
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:18.040]   It also has a unique effect.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.880]   Well, not too unique because tadalafil
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.580]   actually has this effect as well,
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:25.160]   is that it increases the density of the androgen receptor
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.960]   in the cytoplasm of your cells.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.400]   So even if your androgen receptor sensitivity
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.880]   doesn't change, and even if your testosterone
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.740]   does not change, you will have more testosterone
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:38.260]   binding to that increased number of receptors.
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:42.300]   - Does one need to cycle L-carnitine, creatine, betaine?
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.180]   - No reason to cycle any of those.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.600]   - Okay, what other supplements can one use
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.220]   to try and improve hormone profiles?
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:53.040]   And here, I realize we're using a very broad brush
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.760]   because when we say improve hormone profiles,
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.280]   what are we really talking about?
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:00.680]   And for me, at least, I think about the subjective stuff.
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.460]   Do people feel like they are going to have more energy
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:06.120]   as a consequence of doing these things?
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.100]   Are they going to have the more optimized libido?
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.720]   Are they going to have more optimized recovery from exercise?
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.440]   Because, I mean, it's not clear to me
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.040]   that taking one's testosterone from 600 to 800
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.160]   is always going to be a good thing,
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:20.960]   especially if estrogen is increasing in parallel,
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.400]   that could cause issues.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.920]   It could certainly make things better.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.240]   It could certainly make things worse, right?
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.620]   So with that backdrop,
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.360]   what are some of the other things people can take?
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.320]   And then we'll go back to this issue
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.400]   of what really is optimization.
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.320]   - Let's briefly mention vitamin D, which is also a hormone.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.280]   It's actually a sterile hormone.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.960]   And if you have deficient vitamin D and you replace it,
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.960]   then you will optimize your testosterone.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.200]   Let's also mention boron.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.080]   So if you have a very high SHBG,
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.120]   boron can acutely help lower it,
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.600]   usually in a dose of five to 12 milligrams per day.
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.600]   It's not really a sustained effect,
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:59.320]   but boron is depleted in soils.
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.920]   In many countries, I believe it's very high in soils,
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.060]   in Greece and Turkey.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.640]   So eating dates or raisins that are from those areas
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.440]   potentially have more boron.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.740]   Boron also might be one of the reasons
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:12.480]   why the reference range for testosterone
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.360]   is much higher in those countries than other countries.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.440]   - And just to remind people
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.760]   that SHBG, sex hormone-binding globulin,
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.000]   is attaching to the testosterone molecule
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.300]   and limiting the amount of so-called free testosterone
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.720]   that's available to have its impact on cells.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.880]   Dr. Peter Attia was on this podcast,
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.560]   in fact, sitting in that very chair.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:34.260]   He said that the ideal level of free testosterone in males
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.760]   should be about 2% of one's total testosterone.
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.640]   Would you agree with that number or disagree?
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:43.000]   I'm sure Peter would be fine if you said either.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.460]   - 2% is a good rule of thumb.
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:48.400]   Usually the reference range is between about 1% and 4%.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.260]   Some people do have genetic polymorphisms in SHBG,
[01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:57.260]   a specific gene mutation where they have very low SHBGs.
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:00.260]   Also men that have varicose veins in their testes,
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:04.640]   also known as varicocele, tend to have very high SHBGs.
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.640]   So that percentage would likely be less than 2%.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:12.640]   So just because your percentage of free T to total T
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.280]   is a little bit above or below 2%, that's okay.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.720]   We just need to figure out the reason why it is.
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.800]   - How would somebody know if they have varicose veins
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:25.000]   in their testicles, especially if their testicles
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.920]   are still attached to their body?
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.040]   - Sometimes it's hard to tell.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.440]   There is several grades.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:35.480]   If you have a grade three or a grade four varicocele,
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.840]   it has what's called a bag of worms appearance.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.360]   So think about if you've just resistance trained
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.120]   or it's a really hot day
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.800]   or you're wearing very tight fitting clothing,
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.760]   then if you feel it, it almost feels like there's worms
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.440]   in the scrotum.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:50.280]   The other way is to do-
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:51.720]   - Is a scary visual.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.960]   - Yeah, bag of worms.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.480]   - Well, it was just that, yeah, anyway,
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.140]   I think parasites when I hear that,
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:58.200]   but that's not what you're referring to.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.580]   You're talking about just the texture.
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:05.460]   - The best way for most people to check is to Valsalva
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:06.940]   for a long period of time.
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:11.160]   When you Valsalva, venous return will decrease.
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.720]   - Can you explain Valsalva for people?
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.640]   - It's bearing down like you're lifting a weight
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.880]   or having a bowel movement where you swallow.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.880]   And a lot of times you can almost see buildup of blood
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.520]   in your like jugular veins as well.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.240]   So you have decreased blood return to the heart
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:34.960]   and increased blood in the veins themselves.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.580]   I'd like to take a brief break
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:39.700]   and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:42.160]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.680]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.340]   to help you better understand your body
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.160]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.820]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:53.240]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:55.260]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:57.840]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.920]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:03.460]   however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:04.980]   lipids and hormones and so forth,
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.760]   but you don't know what to do with those data.
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.520]   InsideTracker solves that problem
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.840]   and makes it very easy for you to understand
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.860]   what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.700]   maybe even supplementation-based interventions
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:17.860]   you might want to take on
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:20.440]   in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.240]   hormones, lipids, and other things
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.200]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.480]   to bring those numbers into the ranges
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.080]   that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.480]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.020]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:41.240]   Okay, so vitamin D3.
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:43.420]   I'm guessing you're talking about vitamin D3 specifically
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:44.880]   when you say vitamin D.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.040]   And then boron, five to 12 milligrams per day, right?
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.680]   And then what are some of the other things
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.220]   to optimize testosterone that are in supplement form?
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.320]   - We can talk about things
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.300]   that affect the steroidogenesis cascade.
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:16:59.840]   So we could touch on Tongkat Ali.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.680]   I know we've talked about that a little bit before.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:03.140]   - Yeah, but I'm guessing a number of people
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:05.240]   probably haven't heard that conversation.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.000]   - Also known as long jack,
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.040]   and that upregulates several different enzymes
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.120]   in the steroidogenesis cascade.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.740]   And by that, what you mean if,
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.180]   and this is another good thing to Google,
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:18.360]   I think anybody interested in hormone optimization
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:22.280]   should understand where sterile hormones come from.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.480]   They come usually from cholesterol
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.320]   and they can be shunted off to vitamin D very easily.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.580]   They can be shunted off to testosterone or estrogens
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:33.720]   or progestogens quite easily as well.
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.240]   But Tongkat helps with the conversion
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:41.240]   of multiple key steps where you synthesize testosterone.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:46.120]   Another, think of it as like a coenzyme or a cofactor,
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:50.860]   an upregulator of these steps is insulin and IGF-1.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:54.360]   So a good rule of thumb is if you are not expecting
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:57.160]   as much growth hormone, insulin and IGF-1,
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.000]   for example, lower carb diets, caloric deficits,
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.780]   you're trying to cut body fat or body weight,
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:06.860]   then Tongkat is going to be theoretically
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:09.220]   especially powerful.
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.020]   - What sorts of dosages of Tongkat
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.260]   do you recommend to your patients?
[01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:17.420]   - Anywhere from 300 to 1200 milligrams a day.
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.820]   With Tongkat, you need to be careful
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.540]   with the standardization because,
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:25.100]   and if you're thinking about a general Tongkat supplement,
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.720]   which is by far the most well-studied,
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:32.200]   then you're looking at the uricominone content,
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.860]   which is a plant compound that is likely
[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:38.260]   the main active pharmacologic effect.
[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:41.580]   So that's the compound that's having the effect on the body.
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:46.000]   And if you standardize the uricominone very, very high,
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.960]   then theoretically you're having more effect at a lower dose.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:53.080]   - I take 400 milligrams of Tongkat Ali per day.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.060]   I take it early in the day
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:55.700]   because it has a bit of a stimulant effect.
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:57.240]   And if I take it after 2 p.m.,
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:59.580]   it starts to inhibit my sleep.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:01.840]   I've been taking it for years,
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.020]   and I rather like the effects.
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:07.460]   It seems subtle, but consistent.
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:09.400]   I've never cycled it.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.380]   Do you recommend cycling it?
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:13.420]   - I don't see any reason to cycle it.
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:17.640]   There is a reason to cycle some supplements,
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.760]   but no reason to cycle Tongkat.
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.100]   - My blood work tells me that it causes an increase
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.860]   in free testosterone for me,
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:27.980]   and also a slight increase in luteinizing hormone for me.
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:30.300]   What are some of the other effects on various hormones
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:32.700]   that you've observed in the blood work of your patients
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:33.900]   taking Tongkat Ali?
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:38.340]   - Tongkat can also slightly increase DHEA.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:41.180]   And if you have a very high SHBG,
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:43.860]   again, that's the protein that binds up your androgens
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:46.700]   and estrogens, an extremely important protein.
[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:51.260]   The higher your SHBG, the more it helps decrease it.
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:54.660]   So they've studied Tongkat in populations
[01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:59.000]   with very normal SHBGs, and it does nothing for SHBG.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:19:59.840]   - Interesting.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.100]   Does that mean it does nothing for somebody overall?
[01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:05.100]   So if somebody has SHBG that's in the normal range,
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:08.220]   will taking Tongkat benefit them in any other way?
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:12.180]   - Yes, it'll increase their total and free testosterone.
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.820]   - Got it.
[01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:16.240]   Okay, is it known to have effects on anything else,
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:18.000]   like thyroid hormone, growth hormone,
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.280]   or is it purely in these steroid synthesis pathways?
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.960]   Or steroid, I should say,
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.760]   synthesis and receptor and modulation pathways?
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:28.280]   - There's no direct effect on those pathways.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:32.180]   However, anytime you alter your free androgen
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:34.600]   or free estrogen,
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.620]   particularly one without altering the other,
[01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:39.280]   it will alter the binding protein
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.040]   that binds thyroid hormones.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.740]   So any change you make,
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:45.920]   whether it's natural optimization or hormone replacement,
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.200]   you're going to slightly skew your thyroid hormone profile.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.660]   One common actionable example of this
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:55.920]   that I see often clinically is someone starts,
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:59.400]   let's say estrogen replacement or testosterone replacement.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.600]   Maybe they're taking an AI
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.280]   with their testosterone replacement.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.240]   - Aromatase inhibitor.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.480]   - Correct, an aromatase inhibitor
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:07.900]   which blocks the conversion to estrogen.
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:09.720]   If they're taking testosterone
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.480]   and they have very little estrogen,
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.320]   then you're going to decrease the binding protein,
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.960]   also known as thyroxine binding globulin,
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.600]   which binds active thyroid hormones.
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:24.120]   So if you start TRT
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:26.580]   and you either have low aromatase activity
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:30.320]   or no aromatase activity, no conversion to estrogen,
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.340]   then your free thyroid hormones will go up,
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:36.700]   even just acutely, usually feedback inhibition,
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:39.880]   which is how the body talks to itself and says,
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.440]   we need to make more of this or less of this.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:46.160]   But acutely, there's not always enough time.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:49.460]   You're going to have very high thyroid hormones
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:52.800]   and you can have tachycardia, which is a fast heart rate,
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.520]   or you can feel kind of like overly fight or flight
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.560]   due to increased thyroid hormone activity in the end tissue.
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.640]   - Interesting.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.160]   Okay, so Tongali, this is a broad range,
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.200]   300 to 1200 milligrams per day.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.440]   And I realized that the source matters there.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.360]   What are some of the other hormones
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.200]   that you prescribe to your patients
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.280]   who do not want to go on testosterone replacement therapy
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.340]   or take exogenous DHEA or anything like that?
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:22.520]   - We can talk about Fidosia next.
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.160]   Fidosia is interesting because it's a genus of plants.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:27.080]   Fidosia aggressive is one of them.
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:30.320]   There's many others that are very interesting.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.840]   That species is likely the most well-studied
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.200]   and it will increase LH.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:38.560]   So I would not consider it an LH memetic.
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.100]   So it doesn't really mimic it,
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:42.400]   but it increases the release of luteinizing hormone
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.260]   from the pituitary.
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:46.480]   That's a hormone that binds to the latex cell,
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:49.720]   to the LH receptor, kind of like HCG does.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:53.340]   And it will increase the release of testosterone.
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:54.180]   - I see.
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:56.480]   So I think for people that aren't familiar with HCG,
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.160]   so human chorionic gonadotropin
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:00.440]   is basically synthetic luteinizing hormone.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.100]   And luteinizing hormone is the hormone released
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:04.480]   from the pituitary that is going to travel down
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.520]   to the testes to stimulate the production of sperm
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.780]   and testosterone, but mainly testosterone.
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:10.620]   Is that correct?
[01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:13.460]   - Mostly correct.
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:16.880]   Technically synthetic LH is also known as little R LH
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.440]   or recombinant LH.
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:21.160]   And HCG can be synthetic,
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.720]   but often it is just refined from the urine
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:27.760]   of pregnant ladies since the placenta makes it.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:30.960]   That's why it's called chorionic gonadotropin.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:35.100]   - So where are they getting all this pregnant women's urine?
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:38.040]   I mean, is there a location?
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.160]   I mean, not that I want to go there.
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.580]   I'm just, really?
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:41.420]   So they're women that are sending-
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:43.520]   - First trimester pregnant ladies, it's very high.
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:47.040]   - Donating their urine and then they're purifying it
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.080]   and then men are injecting it.
[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.000]   - Yes.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:50.840]   - Wow.
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:53.200]   - And that's actually the same for menopausal ladies.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.280]   So first trimester pregnant ladies,
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:00.280]   that's how you can make, you know, non-synthetic HCG.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:04.160]   And then for menotropins, which are also known,
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.760]   there's a couple of different names for it.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:08.760]   Like Minopure, you have menopausal ladies
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.720]   that have very high LH and FSH,
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:13.400]   and then you refine the FSH and LH.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:18.400]   - Okay, so moving away from the sources and from urine,
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:23.080]   Fidogia agrestis, what dosages do you have patients take?
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:26.000]   I've heard of some potential toxicity
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.600]   to the testicular cells.
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:30.040]   - There was one study, and this is a rat study,
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:34.080]   but you can equate the dose of toxicity in rats and humans.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:37.040]   They did not give these rats any antioxidants,
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:39.080]   but it increases a couple different
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.900]   like pro-inflammatory markers.
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:45.080]   One is GGT or gamma-glutamyltransferase,
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.840]   comes from both the testes and the liver,
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:50.640]   and one is alkaline phosphatase, also known as Alkphos,
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.740]   again, coming from both areas.
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:53.840]   There are several different ways
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.580]   that you can attenuate this increase,
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:58.640]   and you can also just check to see if you have increased.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.480]   In the rat dose that equates with humans that had no effect,
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:06.800]   so the safe dose, was an average of 300 milligrams a day.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.960]   - So that would be 300 milligrams a day in humans
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:13.200]   is the dosage that did not have toxicity, correct?
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:17.780]   - Correct, and often, even if there is toxicity in rats,
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.320]   there is not toxicity in humans,
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:23.480]   so it's not directly equitable, but to be safe,
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:25.280]   another regimen that I have people take
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:27.520]   is 600 milligrams every other day,
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.020]   or 600 milligrams three times a week,
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:32.200]   often Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.200]   - This is very interesting and relevant
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.480]   because I've been taking Fidogia for some period of time,
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.720]   all my markers and tests indicate that there's no toxicity,
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:45.360]   but I've been taking 600 milligrams per day,
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.220]   but I've been cycling it for about eight to 12 weeks on,
[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:51.960]   and then a few weeks off, but based on what you're saying,
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:54.000]   I'm thinking maybe three times per week,
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.600]   or every other day might be better, is that right?
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.500]   - If you weren't going to get any labs,
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.420]   that is certainly the regimen that you want.
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:03.440]   If you're going to check your GGT and Alkphos,
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:06.880]   or even take other things to prevent those from increasing,
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.740]   then you can certainly be more aggressive
[01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.980]   with your Fidogia dosing.
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:13.560]   You can increase it quite a bit,
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:16.260]   and it has a dose dependent response
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:19.000]   in both the activities associated with high testosterone
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.280]   and also just LH and testosterone.
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:26.080]   So the more aggressive regimen would be 600 milligrams daily
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.180]   for a month, and then take one to two weeks off.
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:32.480]   - Great, I think that's more or less what I've been doing.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.880]   Okay, terrific.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.400]   In terms of other hormones,
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.520]   what are some of the supplements
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.720]   that can support growth hormone, right?
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.840]   A hormone that's associated with tissue repair,
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.900]   and in some cases, metabolism and fat loss.
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:45.800]   What are some of the tools,
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.040]   nutritional and/or supplement based,
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:52.280]   one can do to tap on the growth hormone pathway?
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.360]   And let's lump IGF-1 in there too,
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.880]   since they're essentially working along the same dimensions.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.820]   - A quixinopsis growth hormone is a peptide hormone,
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:04.240]   and it is released by the pituitary.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.480]   There's growth hormone releasing hormone
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.400]   and a ghrelin that stimulate the release.
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.360]   So there's also peptides that are very analogous
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.360]   to these two things.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:16.440]   You have that pulsatile secretion of growth hormone
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.480]   in a very fast half-life of just minutes,
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:20.780]   and then it increases IGF-1.
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:24.440]   There is both peripheral IGF-1 and central IGF-1 and IGF-2,
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.540]   but no need to get into the specifics.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.860]   There is a happy medium to where your growth hormone
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:34.700]   is at a adequate level and your IGF-1 is an adequate level.
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:36.460]   Usually those two are congruent.
[01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:39.580]   So in most cases, we just check an IGF-1
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:42.460]   and occasionally the binding peptides for IGF-1,
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:45.220]   kind of like SHBG that we talked about earlier,
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:48.100]   but you're estimating a free IGF-1.
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:52.440]   It's kind of confusing because almost all hormones
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:55.440]   have binding proteins to help regulate them,
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.620]   but often you want to look at free testosterone,
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.520]   free estradiol, free IGF-1, or at least estimate it,
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.620]   free cortisol even, and free thyroid hormone.
[01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:10.520]   But when you're talking about growth hormone and IGF-1,
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:14.200]   usually you don't need to do anything to optimize it.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:19.200]   If you are diabetic, then depending on the type of diabetes,
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.520]   your IGF-1 and growth hormone can be too high.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.760]   Specifically in type 1 diabetes,
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.600]   your growth hormone is extremely high,
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.960]   but your IGF-1 is low.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:33.000]   So if you're in a dysregulated state or have pathology,
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]   I would just talk to your doctor about IGF-1
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.400]   or growth hormone.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.380]   Taking thing, taking amino acids before you go to bed
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:42.200]   could potentially help with growth hormone release
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:45.880]   just because most growth hormone is released
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:47.220]   while you sleep.
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:49.920]   - I've heard that fasting can increase growth hormone,
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:52.920]   and I know there are certain patterns of weight training
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.600]   that can increase growth hormone.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.040]   Some of those regimens in the weight room
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.520]   that increase growth hormone have been covered
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:04.520]   by Dr. Duncan French, who is a guest on this podcast.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.840]   So maybe we'll refer people to that episode
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:12.260]   for the specific protocols, these high volume training.
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:13.840]   - During those training exercises,
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:17.680]   it usually does it transiently for a period of a few hours.
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.680]   And a lot of this IGF-1 is released by the muscle itself.
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:25.460]   So it's not necessarily released by the liver.
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.960]   IGF-1 that is released directly
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.340]   due to growth hormone signaling,
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.800]   usually the growth hormone comes from the pituitary
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.440]   and binds to the liver,
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.880]   where it usually has a half-life of about a week,
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.660]   where the paracrine or autocrine,
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:39.880]   think of it as like the peripherally acting
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:43.660]   or acting in the muscles itself, which is also helpful,
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:47.040]   is released and is not as concerning
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.680]   because it's not related to insulin resistance,
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:53.380]   but it is related to the training itself.
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:56.120]   - So fasting and growth hormone,
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:59.720]   is it true that fasting can increase growth hormone?
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.580]   And maybe as a little related tangent,
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.380]   I've heard that limiting food intake
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:07.180]   for the two hours before going to sleep
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:08.880]   can increase the pulse of growth hormone
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:10.700]   that one experiences during sleep.
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:12.260]   Of course, everyone gets a pulse of growth hormone
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:15.440]   during sleep, but especially carbohydrate-laden meals
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:18.380]   can blunt that peak that occurs
[01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:19.740]   during sleep quite substantially.
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:24.440]   So two questions, does avoiding food intake
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:26.000]   in the two hours prior to sleep
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.160]   help increase growth hormone release?
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.480]   Maybe it's being overly neurotic.
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:31.280]   Maybe people need to avoid food
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:33.320]   in the four hours before sleep.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.800]   But regardless, what is the relationship
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.480]   between fasting and growth hormone release?
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:38.800]   I find this really interesting.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.660]   - Fasting certainly potently increases
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:43.280]   growth hormone release.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:48.280]   However, the end binding to the receptor is less sensitive.
[01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:53.400]   So although fasting does increase growth hormone,
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.800]   the genes that are downstream to it,
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:57.200]   both the growth hormone genes
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:01.920]   and IGF-1 related gene transcription activity
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:04.640]   will not be significantly higher.
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:08.660]   However, if you are optimizing the growth hormone
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:12.380]   that is released as a pulsatile secretion,
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:15.000]   it is helpful to avoid eating for two hours.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.160]   So the general rule of thumb
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:18.060]   is avoid eating about two hours before bed.
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:20.640]   I think that's clinically significant and helpful,
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.760]   but fasting otherwise specifically
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:24.560]   for growth hormone optimization
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.960]   in someone who already has normal growth hormone signaling
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.240]   is not helpful.
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.080]   - That's extremely useful to hear
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:34.620]   because one of the major reasons why people fast
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:35.920]   is to get that growth hormone increase.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:38.860]   But if they're adjusting things on the backend
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:42.940]   that negate that, well then no such luck.
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.520]   Not that I have anything against fasting.
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.440]   I do a pseudo intermittent fasting,
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:50.200]   mostly 'cause I prefer to eat at fairly regular times of day.
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.660]   Okay, so it doesn't sound like there's a lot
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:54.660]   that people can take in supplement form
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:55.780]   to improve growth hormone.
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:56.820]   What about thyroid hormone?
[01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.900]   What are some of the things that people can take or do
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:01.660]   in order to make sure that their thyroid hormone levels
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:03.360]   are appropriate?
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:06.520]   - You want to have a balance of iodine
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.180]   and you want to have a good source of iodine.
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.800]   So there's some camps that say
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:12.700]   you should use a huge high dose of iodine
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.260]   and there's protocols for it.
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.820]   And there's some that say you should use
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:17.620]   just barely enough iodine.
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:20.380]   I believe it's like 200 micrograms per day.
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.260]   But you want to balance.
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:24.860]   One of the things that I see that many people
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:28.680]   do not talk about when it comes to iodine and thyroid
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:33.220]   is there's compounds known as goiterogens or goitrogens.
[01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:36.160]   And these goitrogens are neither good nor evil,
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:39.500]   but they're actually kind of a nice check and balance.
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:42.620]   You need more iodine if you consume more goitrogens.
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:46.420]   And some examples of these are some of my favorite foods,
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:50.600]   cruciferous vegetables, boron is also a goitrogen.
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:53.660]   So higher goitrogens, higher iodine.
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:58.420]   - So ingesting iodine containing salt is useful?
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:32:59.260]   Yes or no?
[01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:02.920]   - Iodized salt does prevent goiter,
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:07.060]   but it is not necessarily the ideal form of iodine.
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:09.700]   Good forms of iodine often come from the ocean.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:12.460]   If you look at a chart of hypothyroidism,
[01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:14.980]   there is a tendency to have more hypothyroidism
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.180]   the more inland you go.
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:20.900]   - So trying to eat some cruciferous vegetables each day
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:24.260]   would be the best way to improve thyroid hormone?
[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:26.020]   - Along with plenty of iodine.
[01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:27.940]   You don't want too much iodine signaling.
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:31.340]   Many people are familiar with radioactive iodine tablets,
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:33.980]   and that's basically an extremely high amount of iodine
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:38.180]   to block out the radioactive iodine
[01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:42.060]   that comes from after like a nuclear meltdown or whatnot.
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:44.880]   - So we've got creatine, betaine,
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:49.880]   l-carnitine with allicin, garlic to offset the TMAO,
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:55.180]   vitamin D3, boron, tonga, alifadogia, some fasting.
[01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:58.180]   Love to talk to you about peptides.
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:33:59.900]   So I can imagine a hierarchy.
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:03.540]   Hierarchy starts with behaviors and nutrition.
[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:05.660]   Behaviors of course includes training and limiting stress
[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:08.180]   and all the things we talked about before,
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:12.420]   sunshine, et cetera, and optimized nutrition.
[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:15.200]   Then we talked about supplements,
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.980]   all the things we just listed off to optimize testosterone.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:21.580]   And we can get into this, but estrogen as well,
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.540]   which is important for libido and brain function
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:26.500]   and tissue function and joints feeling good, et cetera.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:29.020]   But then we get into the realm where one might
[01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:31.400]   or could consider exogenous hormones,
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:33.220]   get taking a small dose of testosterone
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:36.840]   or taking a small dose of GH even if, you know,
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.580]   if that were appropriate and certainly
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:39.580]   only working with a doctor.
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:43.020]   But in between, there's a step of so-called peptides.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.360]   And of course there are many peptides.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:45.820]   We've already talked about some of them,
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:47.400]   but when people talk about taking peptides,
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:51.140]   the ones that I hear most often about is a category
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:55.620]   that increases GH and IGF-1.
[01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:57.900]   And those, to my knowledge,
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:02.000]   go by the things like sormorelin, ipramorelin,
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.700]   tesamorelin, sort of a kit of things
[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:07.380]   that taken separately or in combination
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:09.540]   to increase GH and IGF-1.
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:11.020]   But then other people, for instance,
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:14.260]   are taking peptides like BPC-157
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:17.420]   to try and improve tissue healing and recovery.
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:19.900]   There's a lot of interest in peptides.
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:22.740]   Please, if you would, tell us about what you know
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:25.700]   about the safety of peptides in terms of their sourcing
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:27.240]   and the utility of peptides.
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:29.580]   You know, is this something that people should consider
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:31.640]   before thinking about hormone replacement?
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:33.560]   Should people be wary of these things?
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:36.400]   I am very wary of particular sources that are sold online
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:37.860]   that are not clean.
[01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:40.280]   They contain contaminants and it could be dangerous.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:42.380]   I really would love your thoughts on peptides.
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:45.700]   I'm just going to sit back and let you riff on peptides.
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:47.780]   But if you could touch on some of the ones that I mentioned,
[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:50.000]   I'd be most grateful.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.860]   - A peptide is just a chain of amino acids
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:56.080]   between two and a couple hundred in length.
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:59.580]   So I think of peptides as several different categories.
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:02.000]   And the GHRPs that you mentioned,
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.100]   I would consider those, and that stands for
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:06.880]   Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:08.800]   You have two main types.
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:13.800]   The ghrelin agonist, or they hit the ghrelin receptor
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:18.020]   and it helps release growth hormone because of that.
[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:21.940]   And then also the GHRH-like peptides.
[01:36:21.940 --> 01:36:24.580]   So they're very similar to growth hormone releasing hormone.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:27.420]   Often they just change a couple amino acids
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:29.380]   and it acts like that.
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:32.940]   Tessamoralin is one of them, sermorelin is another one,
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:36.280]   and CJC is another common one.
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:40.240]   I believe those are all in the class of GHRH-like peptides,
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:43.020]   whereas ibomirelin or ibutamorin,
[01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:45.620]   which is also known as MK677,
[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:48.720]   those two are in the class of ghrelin agonists.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.920]   So they're more like,
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:52.000]   they hit the receptor that ghrelin does,
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.860]   whereas the other ones hit the GHRH receptor.
[01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:56.880]   - I think of ghrelin as making me hungry.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:57.960]   - Hungry and angry.
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.220]   - Why would I want to take something
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:01.420]   that would increase ghrelin signaling?
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:04.580]   - Some people are trying to gain weight.
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:06.700]   It also does increase your growth hormone.
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:09.840]   So if your growth hormone is very low, you can consider it.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:13.480]   Ibutamorin is a long-acting, so it has a long half-life,
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:15.480]   also known as MK677.
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:19.860]   It was studied mostly in growth hormone deficiency.
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:22.440]   - And do these people get angry also?
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:23.340]   - They can.
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:27.480]   Many people report a side effect of anxiety
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:29.240]   or significant hunger.
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:31.200]   Most people take it in the evening
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:33.760]   so they don't notice that hunger as much.
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:36.460]   It can also greatly increase your blood glucose.
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:37.720]   So if you're insulin resistant
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:40.260]   or pre-diabetic gets especially concerning.
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:43.760]   - This is one of those rare moments where I hear something
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.760]   and I think, okay, even though there's this kit of compounds
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.520]   that can increase GH and IGF-1,
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.560]   based on everything you're telling me,
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:56.040]   maybe just taking GH is the better option for those people
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.080]   because growth hormone, at least it's,
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:01.160]   synthetic growth hormone is mimicking an endogenous hormone.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:04.800]   I mean, certainly not taking anything might be the ideal,
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.600]   but for those that want to increase growth hormone
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.880]   and they want to use pharmacology to do that,
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:11.840]   it sounds like these peptides are pretty precarious.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:14.720]   - Yeah, it kind of depends on the situation.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:19.320]   If there's an individual that struggles with hunger
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:21.540]   and not eating it enough, for example,
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:25.200]   someone who has a very small stomach
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:28.080]   or they just have a very low hunger drive,
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:32.080]   sometimes you want more of that orexigenic signaling.
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:34.720]   The hypothalamus, you have anorexigenic signaling,
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:37.880]   which is kind of like anorexia and orexigenic signaling,
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.400]   which is, I call it the hangry center of the hypothalamus
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:44.100]   or the hangry center.
[01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:46.520]   And if there's an imbalance between those two,
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:49.200]   then perhaps it'd be helpful,
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:52.040]   potentially theoretically helpful in anorexics
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:55.640]   of which the incidence of anorexia in men is increasing
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:56.760]   significantly.
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:57.600]   - As you're telling me this,
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.880]   I'm remembering being 14 or 15 years old
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:02.160]   and I would go into the kitchen sometimes
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:05.640]   and I was so hungry, I would just obliterate all the food.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:07.080]   And I do remember being,
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:08.500]   I've always been a pretty high energy guy,
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.400]   but having an immense amount of energy.
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.680]   I don't, I can't recall if it was a hangry feeling or not,
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.800]   but I'm guessing that was growth hormone.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:16.400]   I grew one foot in a single academic year.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:19.620]   So I imagine that was at least in part due to growth hormone.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.400]   - In any case, Surmorellin is the peptide
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.560]   that I hear that most often about.
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.800]   I admittedly tried a run of it.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:31.140]   I was researching a book and decided to take it
[01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:33.280]   before sleep on an empty stomach.
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:37.640]   It gave me a tremendous depth of sleep,
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:39.600]   but that sleep was really truncated,
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:42.240]   which is just nerd speak for saying deep, but short sleep.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:44.520]   I would wake up after very intense dreams.
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:46.300]   I can't say that it helped me recover
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:47.420]   from exercise that much.
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:50.160]   I didn't notice any additional fat loss or anything.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:52.560]   - Sort of abandoned it except for occasional use.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.520]   Again, this was prescribed by a doctor.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.880]   You know, I was trying to get the sense
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:00.640]   that these peptides and their effects are somewhat vague
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:02.600]   and distributed and highly individual.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.120]   Is that a fair way to describe them?
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:08.420]   - Part of the problem with the effect of peptides
[01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:11.040]   is many people take them in levels
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:15.240]   that are far above the physiologic range.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:18.160]   Even individuals who are checking their IGF-1
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:22.240]   while they take these different GHRPs,
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:25.240]   most of them do not check the binding peptides.
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:29.200]   For example, IGF binding peptide one, two, or three,
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:33.800]   and their free IGF-1 level might be significantly different.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:38.760]   So the common doses that people will take these off-label
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:42.320]   for as a supplement are often much greater
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:45.360]   than the therapeutic or physiologic range.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.080]   - Which for me just underscores the fact
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:48.160]   that it's pretty precarious.
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:50.360]   I mean, I'm not coming in here as the referee
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:52.680]   of what anyone should or shouldn't do.
[01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:55.080]   Just trying to gather and distribute information.
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.060]   But I've heard, for instance, that some companies
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:00.760]   where people can acquire these things without prescription,
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:03.240]   those companies are not good at cleaning out
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:06.000]   the lipopolysaccharide, the LPS,
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.120]   which can cause an inflammatory response.
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:10.840]   In other words, these are dirty compounds.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:12.920]   And that just sounds risky.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.760]   It just sounds, frankly,
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.600]   it just sounds really dangerous to me.
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:20.560]   - LPS is a common additive in many companies
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.400]   that are not pharmacies, but they're selling things
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.080]   that people often use as human consumption.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.460]   One interesting note about lipopolysaccharide
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:32.760]   is your gut microbiome actually makes a lot of it as well,
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:36.640]   especially Prevotella, which is a specific species
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.540]   that can have to do with your baseline body temperature.
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:43.640]   So your baseline body temperature might also change
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:46.840]   depending on if you're on a peptide that has LPS in it.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:50.160]   - Yikes, yikes, and yikes.
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:52.000]   But I tend to be pretty conservative
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.400]   when it comes to taking anything exogenous.
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.360]   But I do rely on many of the supplements
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.320]   that we talked about earlier,
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:59.360]   and I do try and optimize the behavioral things
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:02.000]   and nutritional things for a long time.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.480]   Okay, so then leaving peptides behind,
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:08.640]   we are now, I suppose, in the territory
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:10.160]   of exogenous hormone.
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:13.480]   So let's say that somebody decides
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:14.840]   they're not concerned with fertility,
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:17.680]   or they're going to bank sperm, or they already have kids,
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.620]   or they're going to defer on this issue
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:21.160]   of wanting to have kids.
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:22.860]   My understanding is that nowadays,
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:24.920]   a lot of people are using testosterone,
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.580]   let's not even call it replacement therapy,
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:29.280]   'cause some of these people have 600, 700,
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:32.200]   or even 800 nanogram per deciliter reads.
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:35.000]   So they're not replacing anything that is diminished.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.960]   They're just trying to augment what's already there,
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.460]   increase what's already there.
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:42.080]   My understanding is that taking a low dose more frequently
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:45.220]   is going to be more beneficial than the kind of old school way
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:49.080]   of giving 100 or even 200 milligrams in a single injection
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.280]   once every two weeks.
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:51.120]   Is that right?
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.560]   And what do you do with your patients?
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.860]   So let me give you a hypothetical.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:54.980]   Somebody comes into your office,
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:59.980]   they do their blood work and they have blood levels
[01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:03.580]   of let's say 600 nanograms per deciliter of testosterone.
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:06.160]   Their estrogen is also in normal range.
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:07.600]   Everything else checks out,
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:10.900]   but they're complaining of slightly diminished libido,
[01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:12.900]   slightly poor recovery from workouts,
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:16.100]   maybe reduced motivation and drive,
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:17.740]   although no major depression.
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:21.020]   And you come to the conclusion that testosterone therapy,
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:22.900]   not replacement, but testosterone therapy
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:24.340]   might be a good option to explore.
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:27.060]   What's a typical dosage range
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:29.080]   and frequency of administration range
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:31.660]   that you might consider exploring?
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:34.560]   - And some of this depends on the SHBG
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:35.920]   and free testosterone as well.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:38.760]   So if that same individual had a very high SHBG,
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:40.280]   which again is the binding protein
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.700]   that binds up the testosterone
[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:43.800]   and all androgens and estrogens.
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:45.300]   If it is extremely high
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:48.620]   and they have a free testosterone of two,
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:49.940]   then they might need a different dose
[01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:51.960]   because they need enough testosterone
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:56.960]   in order to have a normal ugonadal free testosterone.
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:00.120]   But a general normal dosing range,
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.520]   especially for someone starting,
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:04.960]   is around 100 to 120 milligrams
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.360]   divided over the course of a week.
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:10.540]   Usually either every other day or three times a week,
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:12.380]   occasionally twice a week.
[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:15.020]   Many people with SHBG a bit higher
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:17.460]   can get away pretty easily with twice a week.
[01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:20.600]   This is assuming that the ester is saponate or enanthate.
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:23.200]   - So two 60 milligram injections
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:25.080]   of testosterone and saponate per week.
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:26.400]   - Yeah, very common dosing.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:28.400]   - To hit that 120 milligrams per week
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:29.880]   as kind of the typical average.
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:31.960]   - Correct, and I would consider this
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:34.400]   like a physiologic ugonadal dose.
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.440]   For many people, even 200 milligrams a week
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:40.000]   is far above the reference range.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.680]   All of this is said with the caveat
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:44.280]   that testosterone is normally released
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.760]   in a pulsatile manner.
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:48.040]   So it's high in the morning, low in the evening.
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:51.400]   Whereas if you're on a testosterone therapy,
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:54.880]   then you're going to have a steady state.
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.760]   So your testosterone level is going to be
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:59.640]   pretty much the same even in the evening.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:03.380]   - And in your experience, when patients do that,
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:05.480]   I'm guessing they report the normal constellation
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:07.360]   of positive effects, you know, improved mood,
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.760]   improved energy, improved sleep, recovery, et cetera.
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:12.440]   What are some of the hazards
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:14.880]   or things that can crop up in blood work
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:18.220]   or just subjectively that can be warning signs
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:20.540]   that even a dosage of 120 milligrams
[01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:24.520]   divided into these two or three dosages per week is too high?
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:26.360]   - Every organ system in the body.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.320]   So this is when you really have to be
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:32.600]   at least well-versed in every organ system,
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:37.600]   not just the gonadal, like, you know, genital system.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:41.840]   You need to have, you know, dermatology prowess.
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:44.140]   Acne is a very common change.
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:46.520]   Lots of different skin pathologies
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:49.740]   or even bruising can be related to hormone replacement.
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:52.760]   Hair loss is very common to see as well.
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:54.300]   Mental status changes.
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:57.080]   It could, occasionally it even induces a manic
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:58.400]   or a bipolar episode
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:01.080]   because testosterone is also dopaminergic.
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:04.080]   And then cardiovascularly, not just in the heart,
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:05.400]   but also concerns for like
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.840]   microvascular ischemic disease, ferritin buildup,
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.240]   because the estrogen also increases.
[01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:15.760]   And then fertility concerns as well and lipid concerns too.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.520]   So you really have to be, you know, hematologist,
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:22.360]   dermatologist, cardiologist, lipidologist,
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:23.600]   the whole nine yards.
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:27.640]   - So another reason or set of reasons rather to,
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:31.360]   if one is considering using testosterone therapy
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.920]   to really do this in close communication
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:35.800]   with a really good physician,
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:36.880]   'cause that's a lot to monitor.
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:39.220]   Knowing whether or not you have acne or not is one thing,
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:41.160]   but knowing whether or not your LDL is going up,
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:43.120]   your APOB is going up, that's a whole other biz
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.880]   and that needs to be done through blood work
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:46.180]   is what I'm hearing.
[01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:47.020]   - Correct.
[01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:49.060]   And if your physician that is managing
[01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:52.540]   or prescribing your testosterone therapy
[01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:56.020]   or your HRT is not well-versed in these systems,
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:57.200]   you would want him or her
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:59.320]   to be part of an interdisciplinary team
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:00.640]   where they have other experts
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:02.280]   that can monitor those systems.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:06.640]   - I skipped over a sort of still intermediate
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.300]   set of things, prescription drugs,
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:10.800]   but maybe talking about testosterone first
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.160]   was a bit of a mistake on my part,
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:14.480]   because I'm aware that there are,
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:15.760]   actually I think there are companies,
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:17.720]   but certainly groups out there that say,
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:21.360]   no wait, don't go straight from nothing to supplements
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:22.200]   to testosterone.
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:23.960]   Once you're doing behaviors
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.100]   and optimizing nutrition supplements,
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:27.400]   let's forget peptides,
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:30.580]   instead of going straight to testosterone therapy,
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:32.600]   one idea that many people are pursuing
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:35.920]   is to take the prescription drugs
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:37.400]   that trigger luteinizing hormones.
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:41.360]   So taking HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin,
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:44.120]   which my understanding is will increase testosterone,
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:45.320]   but also estrogen,
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:47.880]   or they'll take things like clomiphene.
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:50.000]   In fact, I think there are a bunch of companies out there now
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.920]   that are saying, don't take testosterone,
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:53.300]   it shuts down spermatogenesis,
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:56.120]   it shuts down testosterone production,
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:57.740]   clomiphene is the way to go.
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:01.420]   Maybe you could educate us about the HCG monotherapy,
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:02.260]   I think it's called,
[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:04.640]   where you're just mono, one just taking HCG,
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:09.640]   and/or clomiphene as a tool to ratchet up hormones.
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:14.240]   - So quick points on HCG.
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:16.400]   Human chorionic gonadotropin,
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:19.200]   made during especially the first trimester of pregnancy,
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:23.060]   it has effects other than binding to the LH receptor.
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:26.600]   It also binds to the TSH receptor in the thyroid.
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:28.120]   - So thyroid-stimulating hormone.
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:28.960]   - Yes.
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:31.320]   In fact, if you look at a molecule of HCG
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:33.060]   and thyroid-stimulating hormone,
[01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:34.960]   they are extremely similar.
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:38.840]   However, you need a relatively high dose of HCG
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.400]   to bind to the TSH receptor.
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.800]   This is the normal mechanism in pregnancy
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:45.960]   that accounts for the increased need of thyroid hormone,
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:48.120]   usually about 30 to 40%.
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:50.400]   So that's why if someone has hypothyroidism,
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.160]   you need to increase their dose of thyroid,
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:54.700]   because the HCG is not gonna be doing it for you.
[01:48:54.700 --> 01:49:00.080]   The clomid or clomiphene, there's two main,
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:02.520]   I believe it's di-stereoisomers.
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:04.040]   And one of them is inclomiphene,
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:06.380]   and one of them is zuclomiphene.
[01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:09.040]   And these two work slightly differently.
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:12.760]   Inclomiphene, I believe has a faster half-life,
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:16.800]   and it is potentially slightly better tolerated.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.620]   However, they were studying it.
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:21.580]   You know, clomid is a very commonly prescribed drug,
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:26.280]   and obviously there is plenty of inclomiphene in clomid.
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:31.280]   However, the drug, which was Androzole, A-N-D-R-O-X-A-L,
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:34.160]   did not go all the way through the FDA approval process,
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.120]   despite clomid being FDA-approved.
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:38.980]   - Okay, so there's clomid, which contains clomiphene,
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:40.400]   but there are also,
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:43.000]   'cause we're talking about male hormone optimization
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.540]   this episode, there are males out there
[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:49.040]   who want to increase their testosterone and other hormones,
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:51.060]   maybe growth hormone, et cetera,
[01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:54.100]   who opt to not take exogenous testosterone,
[01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:58.600]   so no cream, no pellet, no pill, no injectable cipinate,
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:02.060]   but decide to take clomiphene a couple of times a week.
[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:04.760]   My understanding, I've never done this,
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:05.820]   I would say, if I had.
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:09.200]   My understanding is that taking clomiphene,
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:11.900]   maybe two 50-milligram tablets a week,
[01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:13.480]   is what I hear people are doing,
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:16.300]   will increase what, luteinizing hormone,
[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:19.560]   the various estrogen receptor subunits.
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:22.000]   Could you explain how clomiphene would benefit anyone,
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.260]   and is this a good strategy?
[01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:26.160]   I'm hearing that it's being done quite a lot now.
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:30.000]   - It will increase testosterone in a dose-dependent manner,
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.640]   but it has many other pharmacodynamic effects,
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:35.100]   which is the effect of the drug on the body,
[01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:38.060]   other than its effect on the hypothalamus and the pituitary.
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:40.700]   So in the hypothalamus and the pituitary,
[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:44.900]   it does what's called negative feedback inhibition,
[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:48.460]   or it blocks the oxygen of estrogen,
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:52.880]   so it crowds out estrogen from the estrogen receptor
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:55.000]   on the hypothalamus and the pituitary.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.160]   - And what's the subjective effect that that would cause?
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:00.140]   So my understanding and experience of estrogen
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:01.960]   is that if I ever took,
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.280]   and I did take a very low dose
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:05.840]   of an aromatase inhibitor once, and I felt terrible.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:09.180]   Actually, reduced libido, joints felt achy,
[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:10.640]   that's when I discovered that, wow,
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:12.520]   estrogen is actually really important
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:16.240]   for your brain function, for joint function, and for libido.
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:18.560]   And suppressing estrogen for me just turned out
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:21.040]   to be the wrong idea, but my levels indicate
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:22.920]   that it's within reference range.
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:26.280]   Okay, so why would I want to take something
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:30.240]   that would increase the activity of an estrogen receptor?
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:33.020]   I just can't find the rationale for that.
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:35.820]   - The main rationale behind taking a CIRM
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:38.920]   is as a very temporary measure
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:41.460]   that is not going to suppress pituitary
[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:43.320]   or hypothalamic function.
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:47.000]   If your testosterone is just so drastically low
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.460]   that it is unlikely to recover anyway.
[01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:54.000]   So most of the time it is not clinically useful
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.440]   and CIRM should not be prescribed very often,
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:01.320]   certainly not as long-term testosterone replacement
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:04.340]   or testosterone optimization in most individuals.
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:06.720]   There's always exceptions to everything,
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.100]   but there's five different estrogen
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:12.280]   and estrogen-related receptors.
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:15.720]   There's two main estrogen receptors in Clomid
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:19.240]   and every CIRM has a very unique profile
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:22.080]   because they selectively inhibit some receptors
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:25.260]   in some tissues, but not other receptors in other tissues.
[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:28.600]   For example, Clomid can inhibit receptors
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:32.760]   that are in the eye and it can cause visual changes,
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:37.240]   blurry vision, especially at higher doses.
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:40.640]   And it also acts in every other tissue of the body.
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:43.280]   So side effects from Clomid
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:46.000]   and other selective estrogen receptor modifiers
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.040]   are very common.
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:50.320]   - So I'm, at least by my mind,
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:52.280]   I'm going to pool them with peptides
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:53.760]   and say it sounds precarious
[01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:56.220]   and probably not ideal for most people.
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:59.400]   Going back to testosterone therapy then again,
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:01.640]   notice folks I've deleted the replacement part
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:05.680]   because I think so many people are using testosterone therapy
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:09.720]   without the need to, the sort of reference range need
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:12.920]   to replace anything,
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:14.840]   but rather building on what they already have
[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:17.620]   for purposes of increasing vitality, et cetera.
[01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:19.120]   Going back to that,
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:23.400]   my understanding is that taking HCG several times per week
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:25.760]   can help maintain spermatogenesis and fertility
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:27.480]   even while people are on testosterone.
[01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:29.260]   But, and you and I were talking about this earlier,
[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:30.840]   that there's tremendous variation.
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:33.460]   Some people will take a small amount of testosterone
[01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:35.320]   and just crush their sperm count.
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:37.200]   They just won't make any viable sperm.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:39.880]   Other people can maintain viable sperm production
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:43.300]   while on testosterone, especially if they're taking HCG.
[01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:44.200]   Is that right?
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:45.040]   - Correct.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:46.080]   And there's many reasons for this.
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:49.320]   Some of this has to do with heat damage to the testes.
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:52.080]   So potentially cold therapy could be helpful for that.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:55.340]   - Ice baths, cold showers.
[01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:59.160]   Or just avoid, and certainly avoiding sauna and hot tub.
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:01.440]   - Yeah, stopping the daily hot tub
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:03.480]   can restore fertility in many people.
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:05.160]   - I know a number of people
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:07.000]   that are trying to conceive children
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.080]   that go into the sauna
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:11.360]   and they'll just put a cold pack in their shorts
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:12.280]   or between their legs,
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:13.800]   depending on whether or not they're wearing shorts or not
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:15.240]   when they go in.
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.840]   Or they'll alternate ice and heat
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:20.840]   in a way that maintains coolness of the milieu
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:24.400]   in which the sperm live.
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:28.280]   In other words, they're cooling their scrotum deliberately
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:30.740]   in order to avoid killing the sperm.
[01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:32.720]   Actually, I saw an interesting paper
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:35.140]   that said that for every two degree increase
[01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:39.140]   in temperature of the scrotum,
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:42.180]   there's a 20% decrease in spermatogenesis
[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:44.480]   and viability of sperm.
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:46.700]   And that actually, if you look at the difference
[01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:50.380]   between people who stand a lot, sit a lot, and drive a lot,
[01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:52.800]   what you see is a progressive decrease in sperm count.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:54.440]   Because when people are sitting,
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:55.540]   there's an increase in temperature.
[01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:58.760]   And then when they're sitting on the hot seat of the car,
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:01.600]   or using the heated seats, actually it kills sperm.
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:03.320]   I think there are good data on that.
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:06.660]   - Yeah, excellent data, and anecdotally, you see it as well.
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:08.660]   I've had several patients come in
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:10.740]   for fertility consultations.
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:14.040]   And all we do is, no medications, no supplements,
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:17.320]   we change their several lifestyle things.
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:21.180]   Very tight-fitting clothing is another one.
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:25.080]   And soon they have fertility, and they're no longer,
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:28.580]   they have sperm, whereas before they did not.
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:29.420]   - Interesting.
[01:55:29.420 --> 01:55:33.000]   I'd like to talk about some of the dos and don'ts,
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.400]   but we have talked about a lot of dos,
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:37.060]   things that one can do to optimize hormones.
[01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:41.460]   Maybe we could just do sort of more rapid fire Q&A
[01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:44.680]   on some of the don'ts, and maybe throw in some science
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:46.860]   where you feel it's appropriate.
[01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:50.980]   Cannabis, marijuana, THC, yes or no,
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:53.840]   it diminishes testosterone levels.
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:59.160]   - Smoked cannabis, I would say diminishes testosterone,
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:01.500]   increases prolactin, that's a no.
[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:04.320]   Other cannabinoids, not particularly harmful.
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:05.460]   - So CBD?
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:08.500]   - CBD, not particularly harmful.
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:11.340]   Smoked CBD, I'm not sure.
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:14.360]   - What about edible cannabis and THC?
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:17.020]   - As far as I know, edible cannabis and THC
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:19.700]   does not significantly increase prolactin
[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:23.540]   to a point where it would be disruptive of hormones.
[01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:27.100]   - Can marijuana, THC, cannabis, whatever you want to call it,
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:30.020]   increase gynecomastia, the growth of male breast tissue?
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:31.620]   - Yes, it certainly can.
[01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:33.420]   And there's a pretty good association
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:36.560]   between smoked THC and gynecomastia.
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:41.360]   - What about nicotine and testosterone and estrogen
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:44.460]   and other hormones, smoked nicotine?
[01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:46.440]   - Nicotine is particularly concerning,
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:49.380]   not only for testosterone, but also for estrogen.
[01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:52.180]   Part of it is if you're talking about nicotine from tobacco,
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:53.880]   there's many other carcinogens in it,
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:55.620]   especially if it's smoked.
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:57.700]   But nicotine, even if it is chewed
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:56:59.220]   in a dose-dependent manner,
[01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:02.900]   so if you can use an extremely small amount of nicotine,
[01:57:02.900 --> 01:57:05.260]   then it's not as concerning in the long run,
[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:06.980]   but it's a vasoconstructor.
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:09.220]   And one of the main concerns with it
[01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:11.660]   would be cardiovascular disease
[01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:15.920]   or even microvascular ischemic disease
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:18.220]   that can lead to neurodegenerative disease.
[01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:19.800]   So like a type of dementia
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:22.140]   that can be partly due to nicotine.
[01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:25.820]   If you use nicotine for a very long period of time,
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:27.680]   especially at a higher dose,
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:32.660]   it's a dose-dependent effect on your hormone profile.
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:36.900]   - Is that also true for other nicotine gums?
[01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:40.300]   - At high doses, if you can use an extremely low dose
[01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:42.780]   of a nicotine gum,
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:47.000]   then theoretically that would be maintainable.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.380]   It's not gonna overload the nicotinic receptor.
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:53.120]   You have acetylcholine and the cholinergic system
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:56.140]   as one of your main nervous systems, of course,
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:59.120]   and you have muscarinic receptors and nicotine receptors,
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:01.180]   and there's just better ways
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:04.740]   to optimize your nicotinic receptor activity.
[01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:08.020]   For example, acetylcholine precursors like alpha-GPC,
[01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:11.460]   phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine,
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:13.400]   weak acetylcholinesterase inhibitors,
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:17.040]   especially natural ones potentially have a part as well,
[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:18.660]   and then other alkaloids.
[01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:21.960]   So nicotine is an alkaloid from the tobacco plant.
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:24.800]   There is other plants like cytosine,
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:27.360]   and that genus of plants,
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:31.280]   and that alkaloid is also a nicotine receptor agonist.
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:36.400]   - Is it true that cycling for too long,
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:39.420]   literally bicycling, sitting on a bike seat too long
[01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:41.620]   can damage the prostate?
[01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:43.760]   - Yes, it can be very concerning,
[01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:46.480]   especially if you're seated while cycling,
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:48.220]   especially if you're putting a lot of pressure
[01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:49.680]   on the perineum.
[01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:52.520]   Your core is kind of like a box
[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:55.000]   where your diaphragm sort of makes the top,
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.560]   and your abs and serratus make the front and the sides.
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:00.280]   Your back muscles make the back,
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:03.480]   and then your pelvic floor makes the bottom of the box,
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:06.920]   which is arguably the most important part of your core,
[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:09.400]   and that pressure can weaken and even lead
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:13.240]   to incontinence and impotence.
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:15.680]   - So we were talking earlier today in the gym
[01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:19.480]   about how heavy legwork, hack squats, deadlifts,
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:21.200]   those kinds of things a lot of guys are doing
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:24.240]   to increase their testosterone done correctly
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:26.520]   can actually augment and build up the strength
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:27.760]   of the pelvic floor.
[01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:30.040]   Done incorrectly can actually weaken the pelvic floor
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:31.240]   and lead to all sorts of issues,
[01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:34.040]   including sexual effects, negative sexual effects.
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:37.240]   So how does one go about learning
[01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:39.560]   whether or not their movements are being done properly
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:43.540]   to support pelvic floor or to destruct pelvic floor?
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:47.680]   - The pelvic floor is a constellation of muscles,
[01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:50.540]   just like any other kind of like system in the body,
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:55.540]   and form is important if you're doing the Valsalva maneuver,
[01:59:55.540 --> 02:00:00.960]   which again is that kind of like bearing down
[02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:03.660]   or deep breath where you feel all of your abs are tight.
[02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:07.520]   You can also notice that your pelvic floor is tight as well.
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:10.280]   If you have a history of an inguinal hernia,
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:14.060]   which is a hole kind of like connecting the abdominal cavity
[02:00:14.060 --> 02:00:15.480]   down through the pelvic floor,
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:16.960]   or even the scrotum in some cases,
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:21.840]   then that can be a sign that there is weakness in that area,
[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:23.860]   and you might have to concentrate it on it most,
[02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:27.220]   or even have a physiotherapist or a physical therapist
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:29.920]   specifically target the pelvic floor.
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:32.640]   Many exercises in which you Valsalva
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:35.800]   or use your glutes or legs,
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:37.200]   you can learn to squeeze them
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:39.500]   and have that mind-muscle connection
[02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:41.580]   in order to help build up the pelvic floor.
[02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:42.780]   And there's other things.
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:44.640]   Many people are familiar with Kegels.
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:47.400]   That is just one of the many different exercises
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:49.140]   that can help your pelvic floor.
[02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:50.080]   - My understanding is that
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:52.200]   while strengthening the pelvic floor is good,
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:53.960]   excessive contraction of the pelvic floor
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:56.240]   can actually limit blood flow to the pelvic area,
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:00:57.320]   the penis and so forth.
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:00:59.880]   So this is, again, it's a double-edged sword, right?
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:01.600]   I mean, you don't want guys out there
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:04.240]   to just start doing endless number of Kegels every day
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:05.880]   because they're actually going to constrict blood flow
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:07.520]   to that area, right?
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:11.320]   And in fact, the erection response is parasympathetic.
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:14.080]   It's a relaxed, induced response, right?
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:14.920]   - Correct.
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:18.480]   - So, you know, for the reason I chuckle is that, you know,
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:19.460]   'cause we're talking about things,
[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:20.800]   we don't have visuals or charts,
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:23.480]   and certainly it's hard to know
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:25.840]   whether or not a given exercise like Kegels
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:28.160]   are going to be good or not good.
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:29.360]   If it's excessive, what, you know,
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:32.040]   how many sets and reps does it take
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:34.440]   before it goes from good to bad?
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:35.880]   Is there a kind of general rule of thumb
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:37.000]   for people to think about this?
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.120]   I mean, clearly blood flow to that area is key, right,
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:42.160]   for sexual performance.
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:45.300]   And yet when one trains the legs or even walks,
[02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:47.000]   you're getting blood flow.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.440]   So my understanding is this,
[02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:50.960]   that a combination of weight training
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:53.420]   to stimulate the positive hormonal and muscular
[02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:56.760]   and connective tissue growth is key,
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:58.040]   provides not over-training,
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:02.520]   but so is casual exercise like walking and stretching
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:03.360]   and the sorts of things
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:05.400]   that will then return blood flow to that area.
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:08.640]   Is that an overly basic way to think about it
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:09.900]   or will that suffice?
[02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:12.120]   - I think that's a good way to think about it.
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:13.720]   I think the main point with Kegels
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:17.000]   is they're just a one of many different things.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.200]   So if you're having some pelvic floor pathology, certainly,
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:22.840]   or even just concerned about your pelvic floor,
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:25.640]   don't just, you know, take the advice,
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:27.200]   do Kegels and you'll be okay.
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:28.340]   That is not near enough.
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:30.520]   It's just one of the many aspects.
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:33.520]   - Okay, so going back to the rapid Q and A,
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:35.200]   and then we'll come back to this issue of blood flow
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:36.480]   'cause there's some interesting science
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:37.920]   and protocols there.
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:40.180]   Question I have is alcohol,
[02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:42.460]   does it increase aromatase,
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:45.360]   the enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen or not?
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:48.500]   And is there a dose dependence there?
[02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:49.940]   - It significantly does.
[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:51.320]   There is a dose dependence.
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:55.260]   In general, I would not recommend more than
[02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:59.020]   three to four, you know, standard drinks.
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:02.340]   One huge glass of wine is probably five standard drinks,
[02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:07.340]   but say every two weeks.
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:08.280]   - Yeah, that's consistent
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:10.780]   with what I discovered researching alcohol
[02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:12.640]   in an episode we did on alcohol,
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:15.780]   that no alcohol is definitely better
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:17.780]   for all aspects of health than any alcohol.
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:18.620]   And anyone that says that,
[02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:20.640]   well, red wine contains these various things.
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:23.260]   Well, it doesn't contain enough of those positive things
[02:03:23.260 --> 02:03:24.220]   to have a positive effect.
[02:03:24.220 --> 02:03:27.240]   But that if people do opt to drink alcohol,
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:29.340]   that two drinks per week,
[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:32.800]   and meaning 20 grams of alcohol,
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:34.860]   so that's probably two 12 ounce beers
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:37.500]   or two, you know, four ounce glasses of wine
[02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:38.940]   is going to be the upper limit
[02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:40.260]   beyond which you're going to start seeing
[02:03:40.260 --> 02:03:42.060]   all sorts of negative effects.
[02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:43.620]   - The other thing to keep in mind with alcohol
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:46.660]   is it has a lot of calories, seven kilocalories per gram,
[02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:49.300]   almost as much as fat, which is nine.
[02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:51.200]   And then it's also very GABAergic.
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:56.020]   So it can activate inhibitory neurotransmission.
[02:03:56.020 --> 02:03:59.620]   And that can also affect how many,
[02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:02.680]   how much LH and FSH is released.
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:04.900]   So that can also decrease testosterone,
[02:04:04.900 --> 02:04:08.540]   almost kind of similar to how opiates
[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:10.620]   can decrease testosterone.
[02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:13.700]   - I feel very lucky that I don't enjoy alcohol,
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:16.500]   never really did, can kind of take it or leave it.
[02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:18.580]   Certainly don't like sedatives like Valium
[02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:19.420]   or anything like that,
[02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:22.740]   which as you just mentioned, can suppress testosterone.
[02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:24.060]   You said the word fat.
[02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:27.220]   So I'm going to pick up on that and say,
[02:04:27.220 --> 02:04:29.100]   in order to optimize hormone production,
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:32.520]   is it important to have some saturated fat in one's diet?
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:35.300]   And what happens on very low fat diets
[02:04:35.300 --> 02:04:38.300]   to testosterone, estrogen, and other steroid hormones?
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:42.880]   - Fat's interesting because there are so many different
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:45.240]   beneficial fats, omega-3s,
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:47.900]   almost every American gets plenty of omega-6s
[02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:50.300]   in any developed country, really.
[02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:52.960]   When it comes to saturated fat,
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:56.480]   there is more of a correlation with hormone optimization.
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:58.860]   If you're eating things with saturated fat,
[02:04:58.860 --> 02:05:01.660]   you tend to have, those are things with more,
[02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:05.280]   fat soluble vitamins and things that are very nutrient dense
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:07.740]   otherwise, but it is not vital.
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:10.980]   In general, you want to eliminate any trans fat,
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:13.200]   unless it's trans fat from the ruminants.
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:15.040]   There's always an exception to everything, right?
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:17.740]   So there is healthy trans omega-3 fats,
[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:20.140]   which are formed in the stomach of like grass-fed
[02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:22.480]   and finished ruminants.
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:26.400]   - But ingesting mostly olive oils,
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:29.340]   maybe nut butters in limited amounts
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:30.920]   'cause they're very calorie dense,
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:33.320]   but unless people are trying to increase their calories,
[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:35.620]   in which case they're a great source of calories.
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:39.060]   Small amounts of butter, ghee, probably okay,
[02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:40.060]   but not excessive amounts.
[02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:41.860]   Is that the idea? - Correct, yes.
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:43.540]   Fat is perfectly fine.
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:45.940]   Cholesterol has an interesting,
[02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:48.960]   so cholesterol and in general phospholipids
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:51.540]   make the bilayer that's around the cell,
[02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:54.620]   but cholesterol is also a hormone in and of itself
[02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:58.720]   because it binds to the estrogen-related receptor alpha.
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:01.820]   So I consider that like in the estrogen receptor category
[02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:03.420]   and that can help with metabolism,
[02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:06.980]   but also potentially have concerns for cancer
[02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:08.780]   and tumor risk.
[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:10.700]   - I want to go back to the prostate
[02:06:10.700 --> 02:06:11.900]   and talk to you about something
[02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:14.180]   that's kind of a newer emerging trend.
[02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:16.440]   I know that you've talked to a little bit about this
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:19.980]   in a previous podcast, that a number of men,
[02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:21.460]   or I should say a number of physicians
[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:25.020]   are prescribing low-dose tadalafil,
[02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:28.060]   also known as Cialis, to their male patients.
[02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:30.680]   So in dosage ranges of like 2.5 milligrams
[02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:31.980]   to five milligrams per day,
[02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:33.580]   but not for erectile dysfunction,
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:36.160]   but rather for improving prostate health.
[02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:37.940]   And presumably they get sort of a boost
[02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:41.100]   in terms of blood flow to the genitalia as well.
[02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:45.000]   But again, not specifically to deal with erectile dysfunction
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.140]   but to deal with prostate health
[02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:49.100]   and blood flow to the prostate.
[02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:51.700]   Is that something that you sometimes often prescribe
[02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:53.720]   to your patients and of what age?
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:57.580]   - Tadalafil is a very underrated medication.
[02:06:57.580 --> 02:07:01.060]   The age would kind of depend on the indication.
[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:04.500]   So tadalafil is also a blood pressure medication.
[02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:06.360]   It can very slightly decrease blood pressure,
[02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:08.540]   especially at higher doses.
[02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:12.500]   At higher doses, a high dose would be 20 milligrams,
[02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:14.520]   not 2.5 milligrams.
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:17.040]   But consistently, it can somewhat affect
[02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:18.720]   with the cones in the eye
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:20.700]   that have to do with red and green site.
[02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:23.140]   Although if you remove it, that effect is reversed.
[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:25.620]   So basically, if you don't need really, really good
[02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:28.300]   red-green discrimination, you can take higher doses.
[02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:30.220]   But in general, I recommend no higher
[02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:31.660]   than 10 milligrams a day,
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:35.600]   usually just two or five milligrams.
[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:39.500]   One other benefit or other use of tadalafil
[02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:42.740]   is that it increases the density of the androgen receptor,
[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:44.540]   similarly to L-carnitine.
[02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:47.040]   So that's an interesting benefit.
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:49.740]   Another benefit is that if you give it to people
[02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:52.780]   with nocturia, which is urinating at night in general,
[02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:54.700]   it will cut the episodes in half.
[02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:57.000]   So it could go from two to one,
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000]   which can make a big difference for your sleep,
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.820]   which will secondarily make a big difference
[02:08:00.820 --> 02:08:03.180]   for your growth hormone and testosterone optimization.
[02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:06.260]   - Interesting, so you said 2.5 to five milligrams per day
[02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:09.180]   is kind of typical for these prostate-enhancing effects.
[02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:10.260]   - Yes.
[02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:12.660]   - And you mentioned the potential side effects
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:14.240]   on adjusting visual perception.
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:17.840]   As a vision scientist, that rings in my mind.
[02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:20.560]   But in terms of red-green color discrimination,
[02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:22.340]   I'm guessing, unless you're going to be a subject
[02:08:22.340 --> 02:08:24.120]   in one of the experiments in my lab,
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:25.780]   where you want to be a fighter pilot,
[02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:27.080]   chances are you can probably get away
[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:29.520]   with a little less red-green color discrimination.
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:32.020]   - Correct, it's not considered clinically significant
[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:35.240]   unless someone is a commercial pilot.
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:36.080]   - Great.
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:37.800]   - So if someone's getting their pilot exam,
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:39.440]   that's one of the things we look for.
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:41.220]   - Okay, so commercial pilots aside,
[02:08:41.220 --> 02:08:44.120]   you might want to ask your doctor about low dose to dalafil
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:46.740]   for sake of enhancing prostate health.
[02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:49.400]   Certainly monitoring PSA, prostate-specific antigen,
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:50.240]   is important.
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:51.320]   I can give an anecdote there.
[02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:55.780]   When I tried sermorelin, one of the surprising side effects
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:59.180]   that was not welcome was a dramatic spike
[02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:00.700]   in my prostate-specific antigen.
[02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:04.460]   No one could explain to me why that would happen,
[02:09:04.460 --> 02:09:05.980]   but when I stopped taking sermorelin,
[02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:07.040]   it went back to normal.
[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:09.360]   So that's one reason I avoid sermorelin,
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:11.740]   at least frequent use of sermorelin.
[02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:14.780]   PSA should be kept, what, below levels of,
[02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:17.160]   somewhere between one and four is considered healthy.
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:18.100]   Is that right?
[02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:19.300]   - It depends on the age.
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:22.320]   If there's a 20-year-old, likely between zero and one.
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:26.880]   If there's a 40-year-old, likely between one and three.
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:28.320]   And then if there's an 80-year-old,
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:31.260]   it would not be abnormal to have a PSA of five
[02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:34.160]   and have that be well within the reference range.
[02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:35.960]   Another thing we should mention about PSAs,
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:38.720]   if you do take a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor,
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:41.340]   like finasteride or dutasteride,
[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:44.240]   often these will cut your PSA in half.
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:47.840]   So if you, for example, if you have a PSA of six
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:49.980]   and you start finasteride or dutasteride,
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:53.200]   and then you recheck it in six months and it's 6.5,
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:56.060]   that is a huge concern because that's actually doubled.
[02:09:56.060 --> 02:09:57.960]   - I'm glad you brought this up
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:00.560]   because I almost overlooked the fact that
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:04.960]   I get a lot of questions about drugs to offset hair loss.
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.880]   Most of those drugs are going to operate
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:09.380]   through the DHT system, the dihydrotestosterone system,
[02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:10.580]   for the reasons we talked about before,
[02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:12.200]   DHT receptors being on the scalp
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:14.420]   and causing beard growth on the face.
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:18.800]   Is it the case that a number of people taking
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:22.700]   things like Propecia and other things to block the DHT
[02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:24.800]   or disrupt the DHT pathway
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:28.160]   are going to experience diminished sex drive,
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:32.400]   diminished kind of motivation and general vigor?
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:34.080]   And if so, are there alternatives
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:37.240]   like topical DHT antagonists that they might use
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:39.600]   if they want to keep their hair
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:41.400]   but not have those negative effects?
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:44.680]   - The way that I think about hair loss
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:47.400]   is you have your fertilizers,
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:48.840]   also known as growth agonists,
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:51.260]   and then you have your anti-androgens.
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:54.440]   Whether they're systemic or topical, there's both,
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:57.660]   but that's the general layman's way to think about hair loss.
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:10:59.580]   If you're only putting fertilizer in your hair
[02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:02.640]   but you have androgenic alopecia or male pattern baldness,
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:04.380]   then those hairs will still miniaturize
[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:05.960]   and eventually you'll still have loss.
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:08.000]   - Such a great word, miniaturize.
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:08.840]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:11.520]   It's enough to send anybody off to find a therapeutic, right?
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:12.880]   - And by the way, it's difficult to tell
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:14.600]   if miniaturization's happening unless you have
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:15.720]   a magnifying glass.
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:18.000]   You can use a shot. - I almost shouldn't know.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.080]   For a second there, I didn't know whether or not
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:19.960]   you were making a joke.
[02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:22.120]   You're talking about miniaturization of the hair follicle.
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:22.940]   - Correct, yeah.
[02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:24.840]   - So what can reverse that miniaturization?
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:25.980]   That's just a fun word to say.
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:27.120]   I'm going to just keep saying it.
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:29.460]   - Each individual has, again,
[02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:31.300]   we mentioned the androgen receptor.
[02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:33.880]   Males only have one androgen receptor genus
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:35.440]   on their X chromosome.
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:38.440]   So depending on how sensitive that androgen receptor is
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:41.920]   and depending on the density of the receptors
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:43.500]   in the hair follicle,
[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:47.040]   you can have a arbitrary threshold
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:49.040]   and you don't know what this threshold is
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:52.320]   until you start to have miniaturization and loss of hair.
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:55.520]   But over the threshold, the follicle will die
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:57.440]   and eventually the stem cell will leave.
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:00.720]   But under the threshold, you're okay.
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:03.840]   Every androgen binds to the same androgen receptor.
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:06.680]   So there is nothing special about DHT.
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:09.280]   DHT is just a stronger androgen.
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:13.640]   So the higher your SHBG, things that increase SHBG
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:16.380]   are beneficial for hair loss prevention
[02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:19.060]   because you have less binding of that receptor.
[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:20.520]   So if you think about hair loss,
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:23.160]   specifically androgenic or male pattern baldness
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:26.160]   in the terms of that androgen receptor
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:28.440]   and everything in general binding to it,
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:31.520]   not just DHT, but also testosterone, it's helpful.
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:34.360]   It's just that DHT is a huge battering ram,
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:35.600]   whereas the other androgens
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:37.440]   are just light presses on the door.
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:41.200]   - Got it, so are some of the topical DHT receptor
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:43.560]   antagonists going to be a better choice
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:46.080]   for people that want to maintain or their hair
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:50.140]   or grow more hair if they want to avoid side effects?
[02:12:50.140 --> 02:12:51.580]   - Likely so.
[02:12:51.580 --> 02:12:55.760]   Some individuals benefit from systemic,
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:58.840]   a systemic decrease in DHT for a couple of reasons.
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:01.840]   One could be prostate and then one could actually be
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:04.160]   hypertrophy of the myocardium.
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:08.120]   So DHT also disproportionately thickens the ventricle.
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:10.320]   So for someone on TRT, that might be a benefit
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:14.120]   that is prone to thickening of the ventricle at baseline.
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:18.440]   However, many people that have just a bit of predisposition,
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:22.760]   they can use things that are topical anti-androgens.
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:24.240]   Ketoconazole is one of them.
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:26.000]   Caffeine is actually another one.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:27.480]   - Wait, drinking caffeine?
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:28.360]   - Topical caffeine.
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:31.200]   - Oh, I was going to say, my hair tends to grow pretty fast,
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:32.240]   but I drink a lot of caffeine.
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:35.200]   - So topical caffeine, really rubbing coffee on their head
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:38.600]   or taking caffeine tablets and how does it,
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:40.740]   wait, you have to explain how this works.
[02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:43.380]   How do people get caffeine into the hair follicle?
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:48.600]   - Topically, the caffeine enters the scalp and crowds out,
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:50.480]   like somewhat crowds out the androgen.
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:52.700]   It is a weak effect.
[02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:54.800]   It's likely just strong enough
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:56.120]   to be clinically significant.
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:13:58.480]   Usually caffeine is put into formulations
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:00.760]   with other things like ketoconazole
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:03.600]   that are also weak anti-androgens.
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:06.560]   Of note, spironolactone can be prescribed topically,
[02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:08.680]   but it is absorbed systemically
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:10.520]   because of the size of the molecule.
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:13.580]   So unless your doctor specifically prescribes that for you,
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:17.320]   especially as a male, do not use topical spironolactone.
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:21.180]   Topical finasteride is also a smaller molecule.
[02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:23.520]   So it is also systemically absorbed,
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:26.760]   but it is not extremely well systemically absorbed.
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:28.900]   If you take topical finasteride,
[02:14:28.900 --> 02:14:33.460]   and usually your systemic DHT will decrease by about 30%.
[02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:36.960]   Topical dutasteride is likely a tiny bit
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:38.560]   systemically absorbed, but it's unique
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:41.960]   because it's half life is much faster at a lower dose.
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:44.740]   So topical dutasteride will not affect
[02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:46.380]   your systemic DHT at all.
[02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:48.540]   And I've seen this anecdotally on many people
[02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:50.840]   on topical dutasteride therapy.
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:52.120]   - We're going to have to get you back on here
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:54.560]   and do an episode all about DHT and hair loss
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:56.380]   and hair growth is, you know, again,
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:14:59.540]   not a topic that I focus on a lot for myself,
[02:14:59.540 --> 02:15:02.860]   but that I get a lot of questions about for men and women.
[02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:04.440]   - One thing that we could mention,
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:06.600]   I got a ton of questions about turmeric
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:09.140]   and curcuminoids after last episode.
[02:15:09.140 --> 02:15:12.440]   - Oh yeah, but I had reported my own anecdotal experience
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:15.440]   that taking turmeric really crushed my DHT levels
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:16.760]   and I did not feel good.
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:21.080]   I mean, it crushed all sorts of positive feelings of vitality
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:24.120]   the moment I stopped taking turmeric, felt great again.
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:27.560]   Many people report this and the interesting thing
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:30.760]   about turmeric is most of it's beneficial action,
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:31.600]   not all of it.
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:34.320]   Some people benefit from systemic turmeric
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:35.820]   and some people that can tolerate it well,
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:38.200]   it's actually great for the prostate,
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:41.680]   but most of the action, it does not need to be bioavailable.
[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:43.520]   It acts on the gut microbiome.
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:48.000]   So you can take turmeric and if it is not absorbed,
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.240]   some turmeric is put in special formulations
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:53.640]   like micellar or liposomal or complexed,
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:56.280]   but a lot of it is put with black pepper fruit extract,
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:58.000]   which is also known as biopurine,
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.220]   which is actually also a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor
[02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:03.560]   and it affects liver cytochromes.
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:04.960]   And so many supplement companies
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:06.960]   put this black pepper fruit extract,
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:09.280]   biopurine in almost everything.
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:11.520]   So some people are on really high doses
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:15.700]   and that could also be making most of the effect of people
[02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:17.400]   who do not tolerate turmeric well.
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:19.920]   - Yeah, I avoid turmeric like the plague
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:21.640]   based on that one previous experience
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:24.480]   'cause it was clearly turmeric
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:27.300]   that caused the negative effect coming off it,
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:29.160]   everything reversed rapidly.
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:31.760]   And the biopurine, the black pepper extract,
[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:33.180]   I also avoid that like the plague
[02:16:33.180 --> 02:16:35.080]   based on everything you just said.
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:40.080]   I want my 5-alpha reductase, I want my DHT to be optimized
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:42.680]   simply because my understanding is DHT
[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:46.800]   is the more powerful androgen and it's the one that,
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:48.280]   yes, it causes a little bit of hair loss
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:50.200]   and I've got a few patches here and there,
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:52.120]   but I'm willing to live with that
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:53.480]   based on all the other wonderful things
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:56.400]   that DHT optimization does.
[02:16:56.400 --> 02:16:58.320]   - I'll quickly mention a few other things.
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:02.200]   One, solpalmetto is also a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor,
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:04.700]   but only a couple of the isoenzymes.
[02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:08.020]   There's three main isoenzymes and a lot of the problem
[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:11.300]   is that you're inhibiting a couple of the isoenzymes,
[02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:12.920]   but not the other one.
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:16.640]   Finasteride inhibits one and two.
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:19.240]   Dutasteride actually inhibits all three.
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:22.800]   And finasteride inhibits the isoenzyme
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:25.760]   that is in genital skin, but not in the skin
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:27.480]   throughout the rest of your body.
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:29.760]   So a lot of the side effects of finasteride,
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:33.720]   which is loss of sensation and loss of erectile function
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:37.560]   have to do with the disconcordance
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:41.120]   between the sensitivity of the genital skin and the skin.
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:44.600]   - Again, another reason to not disrupt 5-alpha reductase.
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:47.000]   And we'll definitely get you back on here to talk about,
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.080]   I think we should just do a whole episode about DHT
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:50.520]   because so often when people are thinking
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:51.960]   about optimizing hormones,
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:55.360]   especially males trying to optimize their hormones,
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:56.920]   they're thinking testosterone, testosterone.
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:17:58.340]   Maybe nowadays they think a little bit more
[02:17:58.340 --> 02:18:00.980]   about free testosterone and maybe they think about estrogen
[02:18:00.980 --> 02:18:02.900]   as also being important, not to crush estrogen,
[02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:06.120]   but DHT is, you know, at least to my mind,
[02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:08.760]   the linchpin of so many of the things that subjectively
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:10.600]   people are really focused on libido,
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:13.120]   motivation, drive, et cetera.
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:14.100]   I have one final question.
[02:18:14.100 --> 02:18:14.940]   It's just a brief one,
[02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:17.440]   but many of us have heard that the BPAs
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:19.500]   that are present in, you know, plastic bottles
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:22.720]   and even in certain aluminum cans and phthalates,
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:25.520]   a difficult word to pronounce, but a fun one nonetheless,
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:29.160]   phthalates and work by Dr. Shana Swan has shown
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:32.120]   that phthalate exposure to the fetus,
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:34.000]   to pregnant mothers and to fetuses,
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.640]   very likely is negatively impacting sperm counts,
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:39.860]   testosterone levels, and even changing genitalia size
[02:18:39.860 --> 02:18:43.060]   for the worse in males nowadays.
[02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:47.040]   I saw a beautiful lecture that Dr. Shana Swan did
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:48.540]   on this when I was in Copenhagen,
[02:18:48.540 --> 02:18:50.720]   and it's very clear that it's negatively impacting
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:51.560]   the male fetus.
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:53.000]   She was also on Joe Rogan's podcast.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.900]   I hope to get her on this podcast.
[02:18:54.900 --> 02:18:57.680]   However, what she couldn't answer for me
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:18:59.840]   was whether or not phthalates and BPAs
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:01.240]   and these things present in plastics,
[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:03.520]   and some people even claim in tap water,
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:08.420]   are bad for males after they're born and after puberty.
[02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:11.000]   What are your thoughts on, or I should just ask you,
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.040]   do you drink water out of plastic bottles?
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:17.600]   Do you avoid drinking out of cans that are not specifically
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:20.080]   non-BPA containing cans?
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:21.960]   And do you actively avoid phthalates?
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:23.900]   My understanding is that phthalates are most enriched
[02:19:23.900 --> 02:19:26.840]   in pesticides, and that's why you're seeing dramatic drops
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:28.880]   in sperm and testosterone levels,
[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:32.120]   mainly in rural areas where they're dust cropping.
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:35.040]   - Yeah, so I do avoid drinking out of cans that,
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:40.040]   or plastics that may have BPA or bisphenol A in them.
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:44.400]   Bisphenol A is known to bind to what I would consider
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:48.460]   the fifth estrogen receptor, estrogen-related receptor gamma.
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:52.840]   So I would consider it a xenoestrogen.
[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:55.160]   So phytoestrogens are estrogens from plants,
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:56.480]   and in general, they're not concerning
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:57.620]   or clinically significant,
[02:19:57.620 --> 02:20:01.000]   and xenoestrogens are just other estrogens.
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:05.680]   So I do avoid BPA, and I also test my water.
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:07.520]   I use a water testing service,
[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:11.400]   and I test it both after it's through my water filter
[02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:16.120]   and the tap water that my two boys drink almost every day.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:17.120]   And it was very interesting.
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:19.720]   I only found one microplastic just a bit
[02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:21.760]   over the reference range.
[02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:23.500]   So it wasn't a terrible tap score,
[02:20:23.500 --> 02:20:27.300]   but even in developed countries, these are widely variable.
[02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:31.640]   As far as phthalates, again, very difficult
[02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:33.680]   and interesting to pronounce,
[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:36.240]   but I remember learning about these because there was,
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:40.520]   I believe, a lawsuit that had to do with mac and cheese.
[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:44.040]   And this was probably five years ago,
[02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:47.200]   and I was coming up with my list of,
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:49.640]   each provider that does obstetrics has a list
[02:20:49.640 --> 02:20:51.200]   what to avoid for the pregnant lady.
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:55.360]   You know, sketchy deli meats or high mercury fish
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:56.480]   like swordfish and salmon,
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:00.160]   and I actually added processed mac and cheese to that list.
[02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:01.200]   - Interesting.
[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:02.040]   Well, thank you for that.
[02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:03.920]   I'm going to extract your statement
[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:07.440]   that you avoid drinking out of plastic bottles when possible.
[02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:09.200]   I'm guessing you're not neurotically attached to that.
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:10.200]   If you were dying of thirst,
[02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:12.800]   you might crack a plastic bottle of water to survive.
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:17.800]   But listen, Kyle, Dr. Gillette, thank you so much.
[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:21.040]   You gave us an enormous wealth of knowledge,
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:24.760]   everything from behaviors to psychology
[02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:27.880]   to supplementation to prescription drugs.
[02:21:27.880 --> 02:21:29.520]   We will make sure to point out
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:31.520]   where people can get ahold of you on Instagram
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:35.420]   and on Twitter and on other websites
[02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:36.680]   in our show note captions.
[02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:39.160]   But really just on behalf of the audience
[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:41.460]   and just for myself, thank you so much.
[02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:42.920]   You have an immense amount of knowledge
[02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:45.780]   and you're exquisitely good at sharing it with people
[02:21:45.780 --> 02:21:46.620]   in an actionable way.

[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:32.680]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab on social media,
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:34.680]   we are Huberman Lab on all platforms.
[02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:38.280]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
[02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:39.560]   And all of those places,
[02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:41.320]   I describe science and science-related tools,
[02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:42.700]   some of which overlap with the contents
[02:22:42.700 --> 02:22:44.040]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:45.600]   but much of which is distinct
[02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:47.640]   from content on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:22:47.640 --> 02:22:50.580]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:22:50.580 --> 02:22:52.840]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:55.660]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discussed supplements.
[02:22:55.660 --> 02:22:57.760]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:22:57.760 --> 02:22:59.820]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:02.880]   for things like sleep, hormone augmentation, and focus.
[02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:04.560]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:07.300]   on various episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:23:07.300 --> 02:23:10.640]   please go to livemomentus.com/huberman.
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:12.020]   We partnered with Momentus
[02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:14.500]   because they are extremely high quality,
[02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:16.160]   they ship internationally,
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:19.200]   and they formulated supplements in the precise ways
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:22.840]   that are discussed as optimal to take for various outcomes
[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:24.620]   here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
