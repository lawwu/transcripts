[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.820]   - Happy New Year, Radicals.
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.380]   Welcome back to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.480]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.620]   Today is Tuesday, January 6, 2015.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.900]   Yes, it is 2015.
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.420]   I made an oops in the last show
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.400]   and I'm sure it'll happen a few times.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.140]   2015, this is the show where we're gonna talk about
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.580]   how to transform your fuzzy feel-good New Year's resolutions
[00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.140]   into workable plans of action.
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.120]   Things that you can actually do
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.220]   to bring those goals and dreams into reality.
[00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.740]   I hope you had a nice time off.
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.940]   I did, I spent the first week out of town
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.220]   visiting with family and the second week in town
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.180]   working hard on some business stuff for the show
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.340]   and then also working hard on some projects around the house
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.060]   working on improving some things
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.320]   that I've been neglecting here in my household
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.020]   and helping to improve my marriage
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.420]   by finishing some things.
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.080]   I'm excited to be back in front of the microphone,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.420]   ready to share with you the ideas.
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.780]   Today I'm gonna share with you some ideas
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.580]   on my personal development plan for 2015.
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.780]   I'm doing it with the purpose of helping you
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.280]   to think about whatever it is that,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.020]   helping you to think about how to put a plan of action
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.900]   in place to help you achieve your goals.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.820]   The turn of the year is a convenient time
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.820]   to think about your goals.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.500]   I like it, for me it's very convenient.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.860]   My birthday is in June
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.980]   and my wife's birthday is also in June
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.880]   and so that gives us kind of a midpoint
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.860]   where there's a special day
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.900]   that's a midpoint of the calendar year
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.400]   and then I like the flip of the calendar year.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.420]   So I do a lot of things in terms of six month projects.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.620]   I use those periods of time
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.740]   to do some personal observation, checkups,
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.440]   just try to figure out, okay, am I on track
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.980]   with some of the things that I'm working toward.
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.020]   So I find that to be a convenient time of year.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.020]   A lot of people, these days, New Year's resolutions,
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.660]   they're so jaded as far as what people,
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.360]   people have all these comments about them
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.220]   because people make them in this half-hearted idea
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.000]   and without any intention of following through,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.940]   no plans behind it.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.540]   They've almost become a cultural joke.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.660]   But I don't see any reason not to take advantage
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.900]   of the natural seasons of life
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.900]   and a turn of a calendar year is a natural season of life
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.220]   where it's useful to sit down and look
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.780]   to see where you're at,
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.220]   especially when it comes to talking about finance.
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.800]   If you're running a company or you're an investor,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.200]   your financial statements are always gonna be dated
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.320]   in some manner.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.100]   So those usually are often gonna be a calendar quarter.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.620]   So, okay, we're gonna look at a Q3 report
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.100]   or maybe you're looking at monthly balance sheets.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.700]   So we're using the calendar month as a useful time.
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.580]   And then you're looking at either a calendar year
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.740]   or a tax year for your year-end,
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.780]   a fiscal year or a calendar year for your year-end statements
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.780]   and so it's useful.
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.860]   And so I just, I like that same ebb and flow of life.
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.940]   So I've been, over the last few weeks,
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.300]   I've been working on my personal development plan.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.060]   I'm gonna share it with you today.
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.020]   Today's gonna be a little bit personal.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.940]   And I'm gonna use this, my plan,
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.820]   as an example of just kinda how I approach goal setting
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.540]   where I focus a lot on, a little bit on the vision,
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.700]   okay, here's what I'm trying to do,
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.340]   and then a lot on the roadmap to get there.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.260]   And I'm not, I wouldn't hold myself out
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.760]   as a great example of an incredible goal achiever.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.460]   I wouldn't hold myself out as somebody
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.860]   that you need to look at and say,
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.300]   "Hey, whatever Joshua does is exactly what I'm gonna do."
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.020]   I'm a learner right alongside you.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.620]   But I have learned in a few things
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.540]   that have worked well for me
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.140]   and a few things that haven't worked well.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.940]   Much of what I've learned surrounding goal achievement,
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.860]   however, has come to me
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.660]   within the context of financial planning.
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.780]   And in working in financial planning,
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.180]   most, many people have financial goals
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.860]   that they've set for themselves.
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.380]   Usually those goals are somewhat general,
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.900]   maybe the focus of, you know, I wanna save some money
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.420]   or I wanna be rich.
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.620]   But few people take the time to make clear goals.
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.780]   And it's really astounding
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.220]   when you start working as a financial planner,
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.820]   you start asking people about their goals
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.500]   and you realize that everything that the success gurus say
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.820]   about the number of people that actually have goals
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.300]   and a clear plan of action
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.720]   to follow toward those goals is true.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.980]   I've always started all financial planning
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.860]   fact-finding appointments with a question
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.660]   about a potential client's goals.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.940]   And it's a really interesting thing
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.780]   because usually it comes out of left field
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.980]   and many people are,
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.900]   "Wait, how are you getting this personal?"
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.740]   But I find it to be a good litmus,
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.620]   not litmus test, a good, I guess, little mini test
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.700]   to see if somebody's gonna be
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.520]   a good prospective client or not.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.140]   Now, it usually takes a little while
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.280]   for a relationship to be established
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.700]   where somebody shares their most personal intimate goals.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.300]   But if somebody doesn't have goals,
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.460]   they can't answer that question in a clear manner,
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.460]   then at least in my years of experience
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.480]   working as a financial planner,
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.820]   there's very little,
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.980]   the relationship is not gonna be very fruitful
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.740]   and it's good to smoke that out in the beginning.
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.740]   So I've always liked starting
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.740]   with asking people about their goals.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.340]   So many people have ideas
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.560]   about what they'd like to accomplish,
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.140]   but few people have clear, specific goals.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.120]   And so setting out those clear, specific goals,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.860]   I think is a good starting point.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.220]   And then more importantly, however, I believe,
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.980]   is having a plan of action
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.480]   that you're reasonably confident in,
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.020]   that if you follow this plan of action,
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.380]   that it has some chance of working for you.
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.820]   Where I've often noticed this
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.140]   is things like retirement planning.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.060]   Most of the time people say, "I wanna retire,"
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.900]   but they haven't sat down and said, "How much do I need?
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.740]   "What does that mean?
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.580]   "When do I wanna do it?
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.860]   "Let's work a little bit of math
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.140]   "to figure out what are the numbers
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.660]   "that I actually need to consider myself retired."
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.780]   And then, is it practical?
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.940]   Can I actually get there?
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.940]   Can I actually save the $3,000 per month that I need
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.060]   in order to accomplish that goal?
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.540]   And so financial planning is very good.
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.020]   The process is very good at exposing that.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.180]   And then the most useful thing about it,
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.980]   about a good financial planning engagement,
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.140]   is that you regularly review the progress toward goals.
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.900]   And so with my clients,
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.340]   I tried to at least have an annual review
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.660]   of the financial plan.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.340]   And you update the balance sheet,
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.600]   you update all the assets,
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.980]   you figure out how much more has gone
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.540]   into the investment portfolio,
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.140]   and then you basically should have a meter
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.380]   to say, "Are we on track or are we off track?"
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.100]   Some of the tools that the financial planning industry has
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.620]   are still a little bit clunky in that regard.
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.500]   I think there's some real opportunity
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.100]   for some programmers and designers
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.600]   to design some really beautiful tools
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.180]   to monitor that on an ongoing basis.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.200]   But regardless of how clunky it is,
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.000]   just sitting down and saying, "Am I on track?"
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.940]   That has real value, has real value.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.980]   So I've been spending a lot of time thinking about
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.320]   what am I gonna work on,
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.300]   work toward here in 2015,
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.220]   and kind of developing my plans of action.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.300]   And so I'm gonna share them with you.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.180]   And I still struggle a little bit.
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.900]   I'm gonna share some of my areas of focus.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.900]   I'm not gonna share specifically
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.780]   some of my specific goals.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.180]   It's a little bit too uncomfortable for me to share
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.540]   specific dollar figures or specific numbers
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.660]   or specific things.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.140]   So I'm gonna share with you in a general way.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.760]   I don't know, it's a little bit hard for me to,
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.020]   some people are very comfortable
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.700]   giving away all the details of their life.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.220]   I'm not that way.
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.620]   And I'm not sure that it's necessarily important.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.360]   I think if you're the kind of personality type
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.380]   who's motivated by that,
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.180]   then I think that would be valuable to know.
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.020]   But I'm not really that type of person.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.740]   And so I'm gonna keep some details quiet.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.420]   Little tip for you, years ago I heard Zig Ziglar
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.540]   talk about goal setting.
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:15.540]   He made two interesting comments.
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.340]   He said, in response to this question,
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.380]   who do you share your goals with?
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.880]   And he said, share your give up goals with everybody.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:28.540]   And share your go up goals very carefully,
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.700]   or something along those lines.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.820]   And his point was, if you have a resolution,
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.180]   a commitment to stop doing something,
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.560]   tell that to everybody.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.300]   I think he was a smoker, if memory is correct.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.780]   Or he was actually, he decided to stop drinking alcohol.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.340]   And things like that, he said, declare them far and wide.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.980]   I will not drink alcohol any longer.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.060]   I will not smoke.
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.060]   Or I will not eat fried food.
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.260]   Or I will, whatever the, you insert,
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.540]   whatever your thing that you wanna give up,
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.100]   insert that here.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.700]   But his point was, spread that far and wide
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.740]   so that people can remind you,
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.460]   and so that you can be held accountable to that.
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.260]   But his encouragement was, share your go up goals,
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.860]   the things that you're working towards,
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.300]   very carefully, and share it with people
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.940]   who can encourage you, and who can help you
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.860]   along your path.
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.820]   In finance, I've seen this a good bit.
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.160]   If you share the fact that you are working your way
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.340]   toward being a millionaire, or a multi-millionaire,
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.660]   or toward being financially independent,
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.740]   you gotta be careful about who you share that with,
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.540]   because many people simply don't understand
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.700]   that it's possible, and many people are gonna discourage us.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.020]   Who are you to think that you can achieve that?
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.220]   So, I think you have to be careful,
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.940]   the forum that you choose, to share those types
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.500]   of goals with, and make sure that it's
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.420]   a supportive community.
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.420]   That's why I love online forums,
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.380]   because of the creation of supportive communities
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.400]   that can come out of that.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.080]   And where you get the opportunity
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.400]   to actually interact with people,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.960]   who can support you toward those goals.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.920]   And you can even do it anonymously, which is wonderful.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.400]   But I'll get to that in just a moment.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.280]   So, for me, the theme of 2015, my theme of the year,
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.120]   I don't do this in some kind of formal,
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.560]   I'm gonna set a theme, some people do that great.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.440]   But, just what has come naturally to me,
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.840]   as a theme for this year, is the term,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.900]   the couplet, world class.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.260]   As I've reflected back, this past year, 2014,
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.700]   for me, has been a major year of growth and change.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.580]   I closed a business that I've been working towards
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.380]   for six years, I kinda jumped out of the comfortable pot,
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.380]   caught to the comfortable bed,
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.300]   into a completely uncertain future,
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.780]   doing things that I've never done before,
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.060]   with starting the show, starting the business behind it.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.760]   And it was a very exciting, but,
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.320]   it was an exciting year, but I haven't felt expert
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.520]   at what I was doing.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.240]   And I had achieved a certain level of comfort and mastery
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.900]   with what I was doing previously.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.760]   And now, for the last six months, I've just felt like,
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.960]   I don't have a clue what I'm doing,
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.240]   just figuring it out and thrashing around frantically,
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.240]   trying to stay on top of the water.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.360]   And it's been a really great last six months,
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.240]   with bringing this show into the world,
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.520]   and so many of you tuning in and encouraging me,
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.960]   and sending me your notes, it's been
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.880]   a really positive experience.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.080]   What has been apparent to me, however,
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.080]   is that I need to step it up a notch.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.880]   And I've mentioned this on the show in a couple of ways,
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.280]   and today I'll give details as far as what I mean by that.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.120]   It was important to me just to start.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.960]   I am very much convinced of the value in most things,
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.720]   of taking a ready, fire, aim approach.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.480]   Just shipping a minimum viable product,
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.040]   and letting the marketplace give you feedback.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.000]   I like to think of all success and failure,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.400]   or just simple feedback,
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.600]   is the marketplace giving me feedback.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.000]   And so, I wanted to ship just a minimum viable product,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.760]   which is why, when I started the show,
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.960]   just let me get something out there,
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.800]   let me get something out there.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.240]   Even though I listen, I can see ways to improve it,
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.680]   let me get something out there.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.480]   And so, I've shipped this show for the last six months,
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.080]   and some of the associated aspects of it.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.520]   But I haven't been proud that it's been truly world class.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.800]   I believe it's been good, but not truly excellent,
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.480]   and truly world class.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.200]   And on the one hand, I think I kind of wanted
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.960]   just to do just good enough.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.480]   I realized over the last couple of months,
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.480]   as I was thinking about it,
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.040]   that I kind of had this idea and this hope
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.720]   that I could just do my little show,
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.200]   do my little podcast, and make a little bit of money,
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.920]   and just kind of live a simple, unencumbered life.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.000]   And that's still there in the back of my mind.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.120]   Many people have large accumulation goals,
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.040]   many people have large things they wanna buy,
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.440]   things they wanna do.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.480]   I feel as though I've accomplished most of those,
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.000]   I don't have much of the desire that many people have
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   for, I don't have the desire for stuff,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.200]   I don't have the desire for a status, house,
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.340]   and those kinds of things.
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:20.000]   So for me, I kind of desire a really great lifestyle.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.240]   That's the core personal focus for me,
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.680]   and that lifestyle is defined in different ways.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.120]   Part of it includes the physical surroundings,
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.920]   but much of it just includes being able to focus
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.840]   on the things that I really enjoy,
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.720]   and where I feel I'm really good at on a day-to-day basis.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.480]   That's an important part of my lifestyle.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   And I realized, however, that I was bringing that approach
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.740]   to the business and just kind of hoping it was gonna work.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.340]   And probably it was due to the pretty rough launch
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.940]   of the membership program,
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.540]   and thank you to those of you who have joined.
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.540]   I was hoping for that launch to be much more spectacular
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.140]   than it was with people joining.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.220]   And most of it was my fault as far as,
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.260]   instead of doing it in a planned out way
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.300]   where I had all the services and things provided
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.220]   behind the scenes, everything ready to go,
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.700]   I just said I need to test this out and see.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.700]   Another major issue was right before launching it,
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.260]   deleting all of my iTunes subscribers,
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.900]   which still has had a ripple effect on the show.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.740]   So that was pretty tough.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.300]   But what I realized out of that was I wasn't necessarily,
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.100]   I was a little discouraged based on that launch,
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.100]   but I wasn't disheartened to the point of wanting to give up
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.980]   I'm committed to doing a minimum
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.620]   of 1,000 episodes of this show.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.700]   I think that's enough time to kind of work it out and see.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.340]   But what I was discouraged was that it didn't just work
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.620]   as easily as I thought.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:55.300]   I recognized that I needed to really step up my game
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.980]   and bring a higher level of professionalism to the show
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.660]   and a higher level of professionalism
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.580]   to all these new aspects of my life.
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.720]   And it's been tough for me to figure out how do I do that?
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.300]   Because my skills are not, for example,
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.500]   on the technical side of creating this show.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.660]   I've never owned a microphone.
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.620]   I didn't know how to use sound editing stuff.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.700]   I don't know bit rates and kilohertz and all this.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.620]   I'm not a techie guy.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:28.340]   My site was the first WordPress blog I'd ever put up.
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.700]   And as I was going through the process, though,
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.980]   I recognized that it's not good enough
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.440]   for me to be good enough.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.820]   I need to be world class at what I'm doing.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.660]   I need to be excellent, truly excellent.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.100]   Because I need to have a good testimony.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.900]   I need to lead by example.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.380]   Whether that's for the people that I'm encouraging
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.780]   to start businesses and forge out on their own,
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.820]   or whether that's for my son who is gonna be watching me
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.180]   over the coming years, I need to lead by example
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.780]   and really be excellent.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.960]   So over the last couple of months,
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.900]   I've come to a resolve to be world class in everything.
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.000]   And so for each of my priorities going forward
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.100]   over the coming calendar year,
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.700]   that's in every one of my priorities.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.620]   For example, one of them very clearly is
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.220]   I'm a world class business owner.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.620]   Another one, I'm a world class podcast host.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.120]   Another one, I'm a world class writer.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.780]   I'm a world class speaker.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.660]   I enjoy world class health.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.180]   I'm a world class husband.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.740]   I'm a world class father.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.040]   Radical Personal Finance is a world class
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.300]   financial education site.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:41.260]   And there are more, but that term world class for me
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.240]   is essentially my focus.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.620]   Is how do I learn the skills necessary
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.100]   to be a real leader in the space that I'm in,
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.620]   in the work that I'm doing?
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.900]   Whatever work you do, do it heartily, do it right.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.620]   And that's what I'm committed to doing.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.180]   Now I haven't known exactly how to do that.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.940]   And I've made some missteps over the last few weeks.
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.100]   One of the things that's dogged my feet
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.540]   has been the idea of how to figure out
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.660]   whether or not I should continue to go it alone
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.980]   or whether I should partner with somebody on the show.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.260]   Because I felt incompetent at the technical side
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.380]   of how do I create a video course,
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.260]   how do I do this stuff,
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.540]   because I felt incompetent at those things,
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.340]   then I've searched for perhaps partnering with somebody.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.140]   I've had a few people reach out
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.140]   and I've explored some options.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.220]   But ultimately, I decided recently
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.300]   that I just, I can't go that path.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.800]   I wasn't willing to give up what I was gonna give up
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.220]   and rather I just needed to, I need to learn the skills.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.400]   And I need to focus on becoming
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.140]   and learning the new skills.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.140]   Doesn't mean I'm not gonna delegate things out.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.500]   I don't need to become an expert
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.840]   at certain technical aspects.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.740]   But I do need to learn the basic skills.
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.780]   And so I'm applying myself to those skills.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.140]   So let me share with you my priorities
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.340]   and then the associated plans with them
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.260]   as a hope of maybe inspiring you to make sure
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.620]   that you've got a lot of meat and bones
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.540]   to your goal achievement plan for this year.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.980]   Let me start with one of these things.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.980]   One of my primary focuses
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.740]   is to be a world-class business owner.
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.680]   I wanna be a world-class business owner.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.700]   And I haven't been able to get Tony Robbins out of my head
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.220]   since I read his most recent money book.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.900]   When I look at what he does
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.340]   in what little I'm aware of with his book
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.700]   as a business owner, I'm just really stunned by,
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:43.220]   I guess his span of reach and influence.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.460]   He has all these different businesses
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.860]   and all these different companies
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.780]   that he's involved in to some degree or another.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.700]   And I've noticed this with many business owners.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.220]   Many business owners run many, many businesses.
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.100]   And sometimes they're related, sometimes they're not.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:03.100]   But Tony Robbins has his resort that he does in Fiji.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.900]   He has a speaking career.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.060]   He has a coaching company.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.940]   He's got supplement companies.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.620]   He's dabbling now in the financial advice business.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.020]   He's got ownership interests
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.660]   in all these different businesses.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.340]   And he still has the time
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.860]   for every other aspect of his life.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.380]   And what I recognized is that people like him,
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.460]   people like Tony Robbins or other effective,
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.780]   influential, high-level business executives
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.420]   have skills that I simply don't have.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.300]   They have the ability to delegate.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.780]   They have the ability to keep track of things.
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.020]   They just have skills that I don't have
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:45.380]   to be able to expand their reach so much.
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.260]   And so one of the key focuses for me
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.120]   is I need to develop more of those skills.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.260]   I don't particularly have a huge interest
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.300]   in doing what Tony Robbins does,
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.460]   although I'm gonna do some of what he does,
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.980]   but I still need those same skills
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.960]   because for me to be effective at life,
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.300]   I need to build those same skills
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.880]   and systems and structures.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.020]   Many people are amazed at,
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.340]   I've gotten emails and feedback from people saying,
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.180]   "Joshua, how do you do a daily podcast?"
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.180]   And I kinda chuckle 'cause I think,
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.140]   now I think, how does Rush Limbaugh do what he does?
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.740]   How does Dave Ramsey do what he does?
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.840]   How does Clark Howard,
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.700]   where these guys are doing two or three hour,
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.220]   how does Glenn Beck, he does a three hour radio show
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.860]   and he does a one hour TV show
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:36.860]   and he's running a TV company
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.640]   and he's writing books and he's speaking
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.540]   and doing all these things.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.660]   Like how on earth do those people do that?
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.740]   And the answer is they have skills that I don't
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.180]   and they built teams and systems around them
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.500]   that equip them to be able to do that.
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.880]   So I think of this as, well,
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.320]   I just need to do the same thing.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.700]   And up till now, I've done everything myself.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.980]   So far I haven't hired,
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.120]   with the exception of the creation of my logo,
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.280]   which was a friend of mine who's a graphic designer,
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.680]   I've done everything, 100% of everything
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.240]   associated with this show myself.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.920]   And I was a little bit tired of,
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.160]   I've had people when I was working as a financial planner,
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.560]   I had different people working for me
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.480]   and I had some really great staff working for me,
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.000]   but I didn't like the,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.320]   I didn't like feeling constrained
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.920]   at having to support staff people
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.460]   and pay their salaries and do that.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.440]   I just wanted to do my own thing.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.760]   And I think enough time has passed now
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.520]   that I've gotten a lot of that out of my system
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.520]   and now I need to really build up my ability to outsource,
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.760]   my ability to build a team,
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.580]   my ability to leverage my time
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.440]   so that I can create better products
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.600]   to help people in a more effective way.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:57.600]   It's not useful for you, my listening audience,
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.160]   if I should be spending time
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.820]   absorbing a new financial concept
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.840]   or thinking about how do I communicate this
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.680]   more effectively and more clearly,
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.480]   it's not serving you if I'm spending that time
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.800]   uploading MP3 files to the internet.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.740]   It's really not.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.720]   So I need to build those skills.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.240]   I also, however, the flip side is
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.720]   I have to do it in an intelligent way
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.080]   because I'm essentially bootstrapping this project.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.960]   I need to do it in an intelligent way
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.320]   'cause I'm not willing to try to grow too big too fast.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.040]   I'm not willing to try to run out
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.560]   and borrow a bunch of money.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.520]   I'm not willing to give away
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.440]   part of the ownership of my company.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.120]   That was the decisions that I came to.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.400]   I'm not willing to surrender my brand
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.320]   and become a sub-brand to somebody else.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.320]   So those were difficult decisions to come to
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.320]   because I could probably, maybe they're wrong, I don't know.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.200]   We'll find out, look back in hindsight
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.400]   and be able to figure out.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.640]   But I could've leveraged and scaled more quickly,
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.720]   but I realized that if I do that,
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.080]   I'll miss the opportunity to become
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.080]   a bigger, more skillful person.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.680]   I'll miss the opportunity to learn to become better.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.400]   So I'm going to develop myself
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.360]   as a world-class business owner.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.860]   And there are a few aspects to that
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.720]   that I'm really focused on right now, right in front of me.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.960]   Number one is I need to hone
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.120]   and develop my personal productivity skills.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.880]   Now, I've got a pretty decent foundation.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.520]   I've been paying attention to task management
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.240]   and time management techniques for a while.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.840]   I've worked out systems that have worked for me.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.640]   I've got a stronger foundation than many people,
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.920]   but I still haven't felt
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:42.400]   really expert at this area.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.480]   And so I've decided that a major focus
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.360]   is I've got to become expert at this.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.000]   At least for the coming months,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.800]   I'm going to continue to be doing more things myself,
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   'cause I've got to build up the revenue of the show
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.480]   in order to be able to outsource things.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.520]   It's kind of this vicious cycle.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.560]   I've got to build up revenue so that I can hire things done,
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.080]   so I can create a better product,
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.240]   so that I can build more revenue.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.920]   But that's business, and that's okay, it's fun.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.160]   It's an adventure.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.480]   But in the meantime, I've got to become
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.960]   much more ruthlessly effective and ruthlessly efficient
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.240]   at my own personal productivity.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.840]   And so I've set out an educational plan
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.160]   for myself in that area.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.000]   And the tools that I use primarily,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.240]   at the moment, I use, I write a lot
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.440]   in just paper notebooks and things like that.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.400]   But as far as the technical tools that I use
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.640]   is I use a task management application called Nozbe,
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.640]   and I use Evernote, and I use a tool,
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.760]   well, let's start with that, at Nozbe and Evernote.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.800]   And essentially what I'm trying to do
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.360]   is get myself disciplined to using Evernote
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.600]   as my brain function and Nozbe for my task function.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.960]   And of all the tools that I've tried over the years
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.920]   of task management functions, Nozbe I think is the best.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.400]   And the reason that it's the best,
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.000]   that I have found so far, is because the founder and CEO
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.520]   is ruthlessly committed to his core mission,
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.600]   and because they actually have a business model
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.240]   behind their software, so it's always getting better.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.680]   I used to look for free software opportunities,
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.840]   and I still use some, but one of the things
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.320]   that I've come to appreciate is the importance
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.720]   of paying for software on an ongoing basis
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.540]   so that it gets better over time.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.640]   Because if you can pay the business owner
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.440]   for the creation of their product,
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.040]   then they can put more resources
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.920]   toward making their product better.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.720]   So I like the fact that Nozbe has a free version,
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.600]   but to really get benefit of it, then you pay for it.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.000]   And they have a really world-class task management system.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.640]   What I'm gonna do again here,
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.720]   right in the beginning of the year,
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.000]   is they have a 10-part training course
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.120]   and productivity course that Michael Sluinski,
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.840]   the founder of the company, has created.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.880]   And I'm gonna go through it again
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.800]   with a careful focus on my own personal systems,
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.960]   and make sure that I'm fully understanding
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.560]   and utilizing the new version of the software.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.920]   So I've laid that out with action plans of tasks of,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.560]   you know, watch video one, take notes, change something.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.680]   Watch video two, take notes, change something.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.280]   So that's gonna be a big, major focus.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.320]   I wanna become really expert with my tool.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.800]   And I think this is an important thing for you to consider,
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.080]   is when you have tools, it's important to know
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.760]   how to effectively use them.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.460]   Many people don't read their manuals.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.160]   And it astounds me when people don't read a manual
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.240]   because they miss out on half the functionality
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.320]   of, I guess, how their tool can work.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.920]   It's very difficult for me to sit beside somebody
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.800]   who's working on a computer, because so many people
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.460]   who are working on computers are annoyingly slow.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.260]   And they use the mouse for everything, they're clicking.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:55.160]   It's very, it takes a lot of self-discipline for me.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.460]   For example, working next to somebody in PowerPoint
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.960]   or in Microsoft Excel takes a lot of discipline
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.760]   for me to sit and watch them work,
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.800]   because it is agonizingly slow.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.440]   And just a simple thing is, if any time you are learning
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.640]   a new program, A, take a course on it,
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.240]   find a book and read a book.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.340]   I remember in college, one of the most useful books
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.980]   that I had was a book on Microsoft Office,
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.220]   where I went through and did all of the exercises
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.280]   for Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word,
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.720]   Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Access.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.980]   It just helped so much to go through
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:29.400]   the basic training functions to speed me up forever.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.840]   And then, so try a book, but then also print a list
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.960]   of keyboard shortcuts out, and follow that list
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.080]   and just start looking.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.200]   Any time you're gonna do a task,
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.080]   is there a keyboard shortcut?
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.960]   You know, on your computer, don't ever go down
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.640]   and click for the next window.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.360]   Use the Alt + Tab function on Windows.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.000]   I don't, I'm not a Mac user, so I don't know
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.960]   what all the Mac shortcuts are.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.640]   But search for keyboard shortcuts.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.780]   If you are working in Excel, you need to know
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.440]   every keyboard shortcut, you need to know every thing
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.480]   to speed yourself up, just to increase your effectiveness.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.680]   So that's what I'm doing with Nozbe,
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.800]   is I'm gonna go through, make sure that I know
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.680]   all of the fundamentals of exactly how the program works,
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.240]   so that I can be lightning fast with the use of the program.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.840]   I've struggled with, I've used Nozbe a bunch of times,
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.800]   and what happens when I use digital organizers,
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.320]   I often get overwhelmed.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.680]   And so, for example, last couple months,
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.100]   I actually switched back to a paper-based system.
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.480]   But the problem with the paper-based system
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.180]   is then, that got overwhelmed.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.960]   So I'm going back to Nozbe, and I'm not changing,
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.480]   because it's the best tool.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.080]   I've used it effectively in the past,
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.080]   and I'm gonna be really expert with it,
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.440]   and focus a lot on always working from that list,
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.480]   which I'll get to in a minute.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.960]   Second tool is Evernote.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.500]   And I've used Evernote for years, but I'm not a power user.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.680]   I'm gonna become a power user of Evernote.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.940]   I read in the past, my educational plan
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.860]   for how to implement this priority,
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.440]   is there's a book called Evernote Essentials,
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.200]   written by an author named Brett Kelly,
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.320]   and it's just all about how to use Evernote.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.480]   It's basically the training manual for Evernote.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.040]   And I am also, I'm gonna go through,
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.240]   and go through that book again, page by page,
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.440]   and make sure that I become a power user of Evernote.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.040]   Because at this stage, my life has become
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.640]   so much more complicated over the last few months,
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.160]   with dealing with research for shows,
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.360]   show notes, show outlines,
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.360]   the actual process of creating the show,
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.840]   handling listener questions,
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.040]   kind of just the whole process
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.800]   becomes so much more complicated.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.920]   So I need to become a power user of these tools
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.500]   in order to keep things hammered out.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.960]   For time management, what I've done over the last
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.800]   little while, is I've reinstituted
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.760]   kind of a time budget for myself,
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.300]   of tracking where my time is going.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.440]   And I've needed to do this because of
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.800]   basically trying to figure out
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.720]   how much time is actually going to handling blog comments?
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.240]   How much time is actually going to prepping for a show?
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.320]   Do I actually have more time or am I wasting it?
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.240]   I need to know those numbers so I know
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.560]   if I'm gonna outsource this task to somebody else,
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.960]   how much time am I actually saving?
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.400]   What's it worth to me?
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.160]   So the little app that I found,
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.760]   I've tried a bunch of these over the years,
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.640]   and now I'm on an Android phone,
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.640]   but I found an app called Glio Time Tracker.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.640]   And you might find this one useful,
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.940]   but essentially it's a really good way of,
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.380]   you put in the tasks and then you just hit start and stop,
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.860]   and it creates a list for you
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.340]   of how much time you've actually spent on things.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.060]   I haven't found in the past
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:34.620]   most of the computer-based systems
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.660]   to be very effective for me,
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.900]   because I need to know,
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.180]   'cause I'm doing a lot of stuff away from the computer.
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.840]   I've used a lot of paper-based systems.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.740]   There's some really great paper-based ideas that I've used.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.380]   But I found this Glio Time Tracker to be useful.
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.540]   And then I also found another app for the Android
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.500]   called Alarm Every 15 Minutes,
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.020]   where every 15 minutes my phone buzzes and it just vibrates,
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.660]   and that reminds me to make sure that I'm recording my time.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.260]   I'm gonna go and check out again.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.840]   I've noticed over the last couple years
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.060]   that I used to use Rescue Time.
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.860]   I've noticed that, and I didn't like it,
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.780]   I didn't think it worked very well.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.760]   I've noticed that they've improved that,
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.700]   so I'm gonna give that a shot again here in January,
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.480]   and then see if they've improved it enough
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.940]   that that could be better for me.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.680]   They seem to do, I mean, it's a more well-built system,
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.900]   probably, than this little time-tracking app
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.100]   that I'm currently using,
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.580]   so I'm gonna see if it's worth the cost.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:28.560]   This is important, that's just my tools,
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.340]   and so I've set out a plan to learn the tools
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.420]   and to become really expert with the tools.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.780]   Then the key, however, for personal productivity
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:41.780]   is not the tool, but actually the action behind the tool.
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.120]   And so I'm gonna really focus here
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:49.120]   in the first quarter of 2015 on strengthening my habits
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.180]   of one, always working from a prioritized list,
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.300]   I've gotten weak on this,
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.100]   instead of simply just focusing
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.340]   on my prioritized list ruthlessly,
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.260]   I get weak on checking this, checking that,
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.160]   we all do, it always happens to us.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.080]   But I'm only going to work from a prioritized list
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.680]   that I've decided in advance.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.380]   Next, planning each day's work in advance.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.140]   Again, I often find myself kind of scrambling,
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.740]   how do I get this done, this takes forever,
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.180]   and I'm gonna plan each day's work
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.500]   and the time allotted for the work in advance.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.220]   And then keeping up on my weekly and monthly reviews.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.100]   What I find is that without those weekly
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.620]   and monthly reviews, my systems break down.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:32.540]   And so that's a big deal for me,
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.140]   is making sure that I keep those calendar appointments
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.100]   with myself and that I do those reviews
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.580]   to keep my lists current, and especially current
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.900]   such that I can throw out stuff
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.820]   that I don't wanna do that I'm not doing.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.220]   So those are just my personal course
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.760]   for setting these things out.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.060]   Now what's useful about this
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.420]   is the reason I started with the productivity tools
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:56.420]   is goal achievement is basically a system of action steps.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.900]   And so I have in Evernote and Nozbe,
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.060]   they're hooked together, I have a goal,
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:08.680]   a project is the terminology for Nozbe.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.940]   I have a project entitled I'm a World Class Business Owner.
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.620]   And under that World Class Business Owner
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.780]   has an outline of all of these things that I've said.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.220]   And that's linked to an Evernote note
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:23.220]   where everything is broken out into a step-by-step,
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.220]   do this, do this, do this, do this.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.580]   And then as it's done, I can cross it out
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.780]   and I can check the task is done.
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:34.320]   And each day and week as I'm reviewing that category,
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.820]   I can see what's the next thing that I need to do.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:41.380]   Many people, I've received questions from people asking,
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.540]   well, how do you, Joshua,
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.760]   how do you get so many financial credentials
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.620]   and designations?
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.540]   Well, it's simple.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.380]   You sit down and you say, okay, I'm gonna do,
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.860]   I'm gonna get my certified financial planning designation.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:52.840]   All right, what's required?
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.540]   Well, I gotta do, I think it's eight classes for that
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.020]   and I need to take an exam.
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:58.540]   Well, let's lay out the eight classes, write it out.
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.100]   Class one, two, three, put the order you're gonna take it
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.140]   and then break down the first class, sign up.
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.060]   You know, your action steps are pick a school.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.060]   Okay, well, actually research schools.
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.660]   You have to research, where am I gonna do it?
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.940]   Next, pick a school, enroll, pay the enrollment fee.
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.340]   Next, order the materials.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.180]   They send you the books
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:16.980]   and then I just add to my to-do list.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.680]   There are 18 chapters in this.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.420]   Read chapter one, read chapter two, chapter three.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.020]   And I like crossing things off.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.860]   So I literally will put read chapter one,
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.700]   chapter two, chapter three on my list.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.980]   That way I can have the joy when I finished chapter 11
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.740]   and I feel like I'm wading through this horrific book
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.580]   of check, chapter 11 done.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.860]   I'm one step closer, one step closer, one step closer.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.140]   And you do that enough times
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:41.020]   and you can pile up a bunch of financial credentials.
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:43.180]   That's how you get through a university system.
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.660]   That's how you get it done.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:47.700]   So for me, it's no different except this type of plan
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.640]   is where I'm actually focusing on the education
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.060]   that matters to me.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.880]   My personal productivity skills,
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.320]   really understanding my software
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.460]   so I can be lightning fast with it.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.440]   So instead of having to think about it,
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.700]   I can be really, really useful from it.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:06.700]   I also need to really develop my personal outsourcing skills
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.220]   and I need to build a team around my business
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.260]   and around my objectives.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.500]   So in order to do that, there's some pre-work,
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.020]   which is what I've been focusing on.
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.300]   Is I need to know exactly
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.180]   what my highest priority activities are.
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.580]   What is it that I can do that no one else can do?
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.180]   And basically that's sitting down,
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.060]   preparing and creating and doing this show.
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.020]   Maybe someone else can do it better, who knows?
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.900]   But that's the thing that I think I can do better
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.420]   than anyone else.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.300]   Everything else I need to get rid of.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.020]   Now, the challenge is how to get rid of it.
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:42.200]   Because again, bootstrapping this show,
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:46.180]   perhaps it would be nice if I could just outsource it
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.360]   and have it all done with a snap of the finger,
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.100]   but that'd probably be an expensive mistake
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.540]   'cause I'd probably just waste a lot of money doing that.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.680]   So I need to focus on what are the tasks
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.760]   that are most important
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.860]   and what are the tasks that are important to get rid of now
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.700]   and what order should I do that?
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.340]   And then I need to find and build a team of people
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.220]   and software to help me with the things
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.420]   that I'm not great at.
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.940]   I've done a really good job with that on many aspects
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.180]   of this show and this business,
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.500]   but I've not done it well with other aspects.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.580]   And so tools and resources.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.540]   So I've listed out and I've done a bunch of research
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.060]   on what are the tools and resources that I've got.
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.940]   So I'll share them with you.
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.480]   One of the things that I'm gonna do
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.320]   is I'm gonna read Chris Ducker's book, "Virtual Freedom."
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.820]   He published it this year.
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.060]   He gave away a copy of it at FinCon,
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.340]   which is where I picked up my copy.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:38.120]   And I think he's a guy who teaches people
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.300]   how to outsource their stuff
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.420]   and he owns an outsourcing company in the Philippines.
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.540]   So I figure I'm gonna start with that.
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.300]   I'm gonna read all of his suggestions
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.620]   from that he's written about how to outsource
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.580]   different aspects of your business to virtual assistants.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.740]   And I'm gonna take careful notes,
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.900]   think constantly about implementing again
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.060]   that thousand percent formula.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:57.900]   What can I do?
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:58.860]   What can I change?
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.620]   Put something over on my action list.
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.920]   Okay, here, this is something I need to do.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.800]   What are the action steps from it?
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.100]   Mark up the book, keep the careful action steps,
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.780]   implement the suggestions.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.460]   Another book I've read in years past,
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.020]   I'm gonna go and pick it up again,
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.000]   is Sam Carpenter's book called "Work the System,"
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.340]   which is all about having a systems mindset
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.580]   towards your business.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:21.180]   And I don't think he's received very wide acclaim
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.020]   for his book, but I really enjoyed it.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.820]   And so I'm gonna work my way back through it again,
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.500]   applying it to my current context,
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.220]   create the manuals, create the procedures,
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.740]   create everything, and document the systems
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.820]   that need to happen surrounding my business.
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.380]   Next, one other site and actually podcast
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.380]   that I've enjoyed is there's a podcast
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.580]   called the Less Doing Podcast.
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.860]   And I commend it to you if you're interested
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.820]   in some of the current tools.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.860]   The host of that podcast is a guy named Ari Mizell,
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.280]   and he's kind of a technology freak,
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.220]   and he's always current on these tools.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.380]   So I find he's basically my aggregator
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.420]   for new and improved tools.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.460]   And so whether it's things like IFTT,
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.860]   If This Then That, is a useful program that I use,
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.780]   or Zapier was another program,
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.980]   how to make all these software systems work together
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:13.660]   and use all these technological tools
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:16.740]   to basically create the systems in your life.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.700]   So I'm gonna go back through his podcast,
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.340]   and I haven't listened for a while,
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.060]   but I'm gonna make a real focus of going through them,
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.540]   notebook and pen handy, taking notes,
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.100]   writing out action steps, using him as my aggregator.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.300]   I'm gonna go back through, over the years,
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.780]   I've read all of Tim Ferriss's books,
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:38.460]   and also probably the majority of his blog.
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.660]   But the thing that is so interesting to me is,
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:45.500]   I remember, I think I found him before he was cool.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.980]   I remember being in college before he made it
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:53.980]   such a massive splash for himself, coming across him.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:58.260]   And I started to become interested,
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.580]   and then I just watched his success and popularity
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.620]   just take off, I couldn't believe it.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.620]   So I'm gonna go back through,
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.500]   and I'm gonna study his body of work again myself,
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.060]   and take careful notes on all of the suggestions
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.300]   that he makes, because he's walked the talk,
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:15.220]   and starting with nothing, with no particular,
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.580]   I mean, a special advantage other than a unique,
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.060]   other than his energy and effort,
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.620]   and personal talent and skill and ability,
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.420]   and applied that to his, so I'm gonna go back through,
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.020]   and I've got most of his stuff listed out on my to-do list,
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.500]   and go back through and take careful notes.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.580]   I'm also researching, and I was planning
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.020]   to make the research before this,
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.580]   but I need to really understand more
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.060]   of the best strategies of things that are going on
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:46.500]   for online businesses, and some of the,
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.460]   so I'm gonna take a look at the resources
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.140]   from a site and some guys that are doing a project
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:56.580]   called Fizzle, and there are three entrepreneurs
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.060]   who are essentially coaching people to online businesses,
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.620]   and I'm gonna go through their stuff,
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.900]   and try to learn everything I can from their systems,
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.620]   and apply that to my scenario.
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:11.460]   I also have a number of other specific technical things
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.660]   that I need to learn, and so one of them
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:17.540]   is I need to really become, not necessarily an expert,
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.980]   I don't need to become world-class,
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:22.380]   but I need to be very good at WordPress, and I'm not.
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.260]   I get intimidated by the web stuff,
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:27.780]   and ultimately, I don't wish to do it,
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.620]   but I need to be intelligent enough at it
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.500]   to have it done for me, and so I'm still
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.580]   in the process of researching, okay,
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.180]   who's gonna be my WordPress coach and teacher.
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.900]   I also need to become an expert at email marketing.
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.940]   I use AWeber, which my system is totally broken right now,
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.620]   so I'm gonna fix that up, and then my membership site
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.940]   and that software, I need to become an expert at that.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.300]   So those are also priorities for me to go through
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.880]   all of their training tutorials,
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.580]   make sure that I become really expert at that,
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.060]   and then an additional technical skill
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.460]   that I need to learn is I need to learn
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.340]   how to do screencasts and video casts,
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.540]   because a lot of the specialized product training
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.560]   is gonna be based upon screencasts and video casts.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:11.300]   So under my business owner project,
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.680]   those are my different priorities,
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.660]   and it probably sounds like a lot.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.180]   It is a lot.
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.700]   I find that I prefer to have more stuff on my list
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.940]   than I'll ever get done, so that when I get bored
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.260]   with one thing, I can just flip to something else
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.820]   that's already on my list, and so I do not expect
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.820]   to be able to cross everything off of my list
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.500]   on those strategies within this year
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.540]   or this quarter or anything.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.600]   I don't expect to ever finish that list,
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.220]   but I know that if I get 50 or 70% of the way through it,
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:42.140]   I'll be an expert at that, so that's just all I gotta do
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.740]   is I gotta get at least 50 or 70% of the way through it,
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.340]   and I'll probably get through a good bit of it,
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.940]   but then I'll probably reassess and say,
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.140]   you know what, I'm good enough at this.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:55.100]   I understand enough about how to do WordPress on my own.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.260]   I've been able to fix these things myself.
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:00.060]   Now I know enough to hire a good developer
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:03.660]   who's really world-class at it, so fundamentals,
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.220]   gonna build the fundamentals in all of those areas.
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.420]   Now I know that was a lot, and I'm not gonna go
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.100]   through every one of my areas of focus
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.700]   to that degree of depth.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.900]   I'm gonna cover two more with a little bit of depth,
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.460]   and then just briefly touch on each of the other ones,
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:23.940]   but my point in doing that was that my hope for you
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.480]   is that you will apply this same process
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.700]   of designing an educational plan for yourself
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.600]   that's in line with your goals.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.340]   So if you understand what do I need to do,
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:35.860]   what am I trying to accomplish, and then you can say,
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.880]   well, now in order for me to do that,
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.740]   what skills do I need to develop?
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.340]   What knowledge do I need?
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.720]   Now you have a focus.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:48.140]   With that focus, you'll be able to accomplish things,
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.020]   because then you can look for areas of synergy,
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.420]   and I'm gonna share with you how I'm structuring,
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.060]   at least with my plan.
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.160]   We'll see if the plan survives contact
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.420]   with the enemy or not, but my plan
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.560]   of how I'm overlapping all these things.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.620]   The important thing is once you know
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.900]   the specific skills that you're weak in,
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.220]   then you can target your learning.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.580]   I know many of you listen to my show on your commute.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.100]   I love that, I think that's awesome,
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.700]   and I hope that I can really serve you
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.200]   toward your financial independence goals.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.300]   But remember that you shouldn't only consume my show
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.500]   if you've got enough of the basics down
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.580]   and you need to focus on something else.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:30.700]   So the reason I need to be a world-class business owner,
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.460]   one of the reasons, is very important,
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.080]   is because this is the way that I'm funding
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.120]   my financial independence plan.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.020]   I'm funding it immediately with building my ideal lifestyle
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:44.580]   without having the savings to be able to just simply say,
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.020]   I'm declaring myself financially independent
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.620]   off of investment income.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:51.420]   So I need to build the business to fund this lifestyle now,
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.620]   and I need to continue to build the business
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.820]   to provide enough room in my personal finances
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.260]   for me to save enough money in a reasonable amount of time
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.960]   to become financially independent.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.500]   My show, my hope, is that it's very useful for you
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.820]   to encourage you and inspire you
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.340]   toward your financial independence.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.420]   But you may find that my content
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.740]   is not serving your specific needs right now.
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.420]   You might find, for example,
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.620]   that you work in the marketing department
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.220]   and you need to become,
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.100]   in order to gain your financial independence,
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.960]   you need to become a vice president of marketing
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.860]   at the firm at which you work.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.620]   Well, in that scenario, you're probably well-served
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:35.300]   by finding some really excellent marketing podcasts
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:40.220]   and interspersing my show with those marketing podcasts.
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.300]   But you need to sit down and say,
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.660]   what's the plan towards that?
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.460]   So for me, I'm not at the stage
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:46.500]   where I need to go and listen
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.420]   to any more financial podcasts.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.780]   I'm at the stage where I need to go
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.300]   and listen to a WordPress podcast,
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.840]   or I need to listen to little technical tools
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.160]   that I can use to really develop,
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.780]   to streamline my life,
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.980]   or how do I outsource these things in a more effective way,
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.640]   or how do I do a better email marketing campaign,
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.980]   that type of thing.
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.580]   So this is why I'm sharing with you my ideas
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.860]   is to hopefully encourage you and inspire you
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.260]   and give you some tools
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.980]   that you can apply to your own scenario.
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.980]   Let me give you a couple more that have to do with the show,
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.420]   and I'll tell you just how I'm designing
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.220]   my personal development plan for this coming year.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:26.720]   The next one is I'm a world-class podcast host.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.640]   And I split this out from being a world-class business owner
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.420]   because the host is a very different set of,
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:37.520]   it's a very different skill set than the business owner.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.700]   The skill of being the broadcast host
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:45.080]   is all about my on-air presentation.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.020]   How concise is it?
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.420]   How in-depth is it?
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:50.780]   How interesting is it?
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.060]   How funny is it?
[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:55.580]   How, do I use the right tone?
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.540]   Is it engaging?
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.300]   And to me, this has been the toughest thing for me
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.980]   to figure out how to develop a plan behind,
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.920]   'cause I haven't known where to go for examples.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:13.740]   For example, how do I become a really great interviewer?
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.420]   Well, the only best thing I have is just by noticing people
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.540]   in interviews that I enjoy and trying to listen
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.920]   and see what is it that they do.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.940]   I haven't found a book that says,
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.540]   here's how to be a world-class interviewer.
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:28.820]   So here, under this category,
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.960]   my plan is actually fairly simple.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.220]   The best resource that I've found so far
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:38.060]   is I found a website called transom.org,
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.420]   T-R-A-N-S-O-M, transom.org.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.900]   And the founders of Transom,
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.220]   they're affiliated with public radio.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:48.460]   And essentially, it's all about how to create
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:51.500]   good public radio for national public radio.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.020]   It's the most useful thing that I've found
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.540]   where they're taking from the radio world
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:01.260]   and applying it to all types of media,
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.580]   whether it's distributed as a podcast only
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.860]   or as a radio show and a podcast.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.340]   And so this is heavily influenced
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.220]   by popular public radio shows,
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:13.060]   such as This American Life or Radiolab.
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:16.700]   That type of reporting radio
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.180]   is essentially what they're heavily focused on.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:22.600]   But I've enjoyed a lot of their topics.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.380]   I have to figure out how to apply that
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:28.900]   to teaching and education, because it's very different.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.140]   My wife and I enjoy listening to Radiolab,
[00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.340]   but that's something that we listen to
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:36.060]   when we're in the car together on a trip somewhere.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.540]   That's not an effective way
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:41.020]   of communicating in-depth financial content.
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.900]   So I've had to figure out how do I take some of that
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.560]   and apply it to what I'm doing.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.780]   So I'm spending a good amount of time
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:50.500]   consuming the information and the teaching at Transom,
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.540]   listening and thinking,
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:55.560]   how can I apply these lessons to myself?
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.020]   But the key thing on this one,
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:00.660]   way for me to become a world-class podcast host,
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:03.780]   is I dedicate time, well, actually, before I get to that,
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.420]   one of the key things is by doing a lot of it.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:10.060]   One of the reasons why I started The Daily Show,
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:13.140]   and I may not continue The Daily Show forever, I don't know,
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:16.300]   but one of the big reasons was I needed to do it.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.280]   I needed to do it a lot to get better.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:23.060]   I have gotten worlds better as a host
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.220]   over the last six months
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.740]   by doing the show as frequently as I've done it
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:30.300]   than I would have if I'd only been doing a weekly show
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.660]   or a biweekly show, something like that.
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.420]   So I need to do a lot of something
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:39.780]   when starting to get better.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.660]   I remember this was one thing I did well
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.820]   when I was starting my financial planning career,
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:47.300]   is I was terribly nervous about talking to people,
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.700]   and in the financial planning business,
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:49.940]   we call it doing a fact-finder,
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:53.060]   where you go out on an initial conversation with somebody
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:54.620]   and you get to know them
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.240]   and find out what they're trying to accomplish.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.300]   Well, the only way to get good at it is,
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.460]   yeah, you gotta study a little bit,
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.820]   then you just gotta go do it.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.260]   Dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of times
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:05.860]   until you get really comfortable
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:07.860]   because you've been down this road 50 times.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.900]   You know exactly how this conversation is shaping up.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.020]   So one of the key tools, I think,
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:16.100]   that we don't talk about enough in our culture,
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.100]   we talk a lot about how to do things smarter.
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.020]   Yeah, do things smarter, but just simply do more.
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:22.980]   Write more, write more stories,
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.540]   and you're gonna get better as a writer more quickly.
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.660]   Record more shows,
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:28.660]   you're gonna get better as a host quickly.
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.100]   But then the key also for me,
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:33.460]   which is where I was going before I interrupted myself,
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:35.740]   is in addition to doing more shows,
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.660]   carefully listening to my shows and coaching myself.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:43.660]   Oftentimes, this is a bit countercultural.
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.960]   We don't usually trust ourselves to coach ourselves.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.860]   We usually look for someone else to coach us
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.540]   and usually look to someone else for their affirmation.
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.700]   But the reality is,
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.820]   we're probably pretty good consumers of our own content.
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:58.860]   I'm a pretty good consumer of financial content,
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.780]   so what I need to spend time doing,
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.980]   and I do this, and I'm gonna do it a lot more
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.140]   in this coming six months,
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.420]   I haven't made the time for it over the past six months,
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.020]   is listening carefully to my shows.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:12.780]   Listening and saying, what was annoying?
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.500]   I catch certain verbal crutches,
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.300]   I catch certain repetitive things that I do.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.740]   For example, I have a tendency to repeat myself.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.820]   And so by focusing and recognizing,
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.140]   I asked the question twice,
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.220]   I repeated myself multiple times,
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:28.620]   it allows me to slow down
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.180]   and produce a better quality product.
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:33.880]   And so just by focusing on
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.300]   what is the actual quality of my work.
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.980]   In financial planning, you could do this in your career.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:40.540]   One thing I've recommended to many people
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:42.220]   is when you're making phone calls.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:43.940]   A lot of my business had to do with making
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.600]   outbound initial introductory sales calls
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.980]   to schedule an appointment
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:49.440]   for a financial planning appointment.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.860]   I would record that, record the audio and listen to myself
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.780]   and say, would I give myself an appointment?
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.180]   And I tell you what, for a lot of time it was no.
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.100]   But then over time you learn, okay,
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:01.780]   yeah, I would give myself an appointment.
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:05.020]   That sounds like a reasonable professional approach.
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.900]   I would give myself an appointment.
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:08.180]   So the super, super valuable,
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:10.660]   just focus on your own work
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:13.620]   and think about how it can be better.
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:19.000]   So that's one of my areas of becoming a better host
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.500]   is just a few of the aspects from my educational plan
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:26.420]   to build the skills necessary to become a better host.
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:29.820]   Another project of mine for 2015 is this.
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:33.500]   Radical Personal Finance is a world-class
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.400]   financial education resource.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.360]   That's my vision.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:43.620]   And in order to do that,
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:47.340]   I've got a lot of work to do to build that up.
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.200]   What I've learned is in many ways,
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:54.980]   I'm seeing more and more how the structure of this show
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:57.100]   is going to work into the business.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.860]   And I thought that the show itself
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:01.560]   was going to be that resource.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:05.860]   And I think it will be, continue to be that resource.
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.580]   But what I've recognized is that in many ways,
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.140]   the show is almost the sales page.
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:12.380]   The show is almost the lead-in
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.940]   to the other resources and products.
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.640]   One of the ideas that I've had
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.380]   that I haven't been able to implement yet
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.020]   is to map my shows
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.300]   to the certified financial planner curriculum
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:26.700]   so that somebody who's an interested CFP student
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:27.660]   can simply go and say,
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:30.620]   "Ah, here are all of the CFP topics.
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:33.820]   "Now I'll just listen through those shows in that order."
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.460]   But what I've learned is that in order for me
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:40.540]   to create the type of radio show that I'm envisioning,
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:45.040]   it has a lot of variability with topics.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.460]   So that makes it very difficult
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:50.220]   for someone to go back through the somewhat voluminous
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:52.500]   and growing everyday archives
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.860]   in order to find the topics that they need.
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:57.980]   So what I need to do is continue creating the show
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.260]   as the resource for the regular listeners
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.980]   who can consume the entire body of work.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:06.020]   But then I also need to create a number of guides
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:08.660]   and products that are specifically suited
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.100]   to specific situations.
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:16.100]   And this has to be to complement the financial advisor
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:19.820]   rather than to compete with the financial advisor.
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.580]   I can't compete with financial advisors effectively.
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.860]   I think we need good financial advisors.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:27.340]   And one of the most frustrating things for me to do
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:29.300]   has been to try to figure out
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:34.180]   how do I serve the need for great financial advisors myself?
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:36.900]   And I've had this for the last six months.
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:40.660]   I had this registered investment advisory firm pending
[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:42.100]   and it was never officially open.
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:43.860]   And finally, a few weeks ago,
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.740]   I just simply made the decision,
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:47.380]   my wife and I said, "Listen, I cannot do this.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:49.360]   "I at least can't do it right now."
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.940]   Whether or not I could do it someday,
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:52.380]   I can't do it right now.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:55.580]   That the educational resources are more important
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.580]   and that's what needs to be done right now.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.980]   So I can't begin the firm.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:04.980]   I'm perfectly confident that if I desired to,
[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:09.460]   I could create a firm similar to what Rick Edelman has done
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:12.100]   where he is the marketing spokespiece
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:13.660]   for the firm of advisors.
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:15.940]   And I could train advisors to do planning
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:17.340]   the way that I think it should be done
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:18.780]   in this comprehensive way.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:22.040]   I think I could help reinvent the industry,
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.240]   but I don't have the skills.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.420]   I'll just say I don't have the skills
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:26.600]   to do that at the moment.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.240]   The same way I said I need the business owner skills,
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.800]   I don't have the capacity.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.640]   So I finally said, "Just gonna shut it down.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.100]   "No chance of doing that, period.
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:35.100]   "Not gonna do it.
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.920]   "I'm gonna focus on building the educational resource."
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.940]   So what I need to create for Radical Personal Finance
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:44.820]   is I need to create a lot of useful educational resources
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:48.140]   that answer specific questions for do-it-yourselfers,
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:52.020]   but that also help people to become confident
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:54.300]   and competent in preparation
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:56.620]   for meeting with their advisors.
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.780]   Let's say as an example, I were going to,
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.860]   somebody was a new parent,
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:03.900]   and they knew that they needed
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.540]   to purchase some life insurance.
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:09.220]   Well, it would be useful if they could go
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.060]   and find a resource that said,
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:13.060]   "Here's what you need to know about life insurance."
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:14.280]   And this would be a course.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.020]   I'm envisioning a video course,
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:19.960]   four or five sessions, 30 minutes each,
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:24.640]   a comprehensive, straightforward primer on life insurance
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:29.160]   that could tell them basically how to do it themselves,
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.440]   but then also give them the information they need
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.840]   when speaking to a life insurance expert.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.440]   That way, they could feel comfortable
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.640]   with their level of knowledge,
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:39.800]   and then get the specialized advice of an expert.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:43.600]   Or if somebody is saying a common question
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.560]   I get on the show, "How do I know
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.480]   "if I have enough money to retire?"
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.240]   Well, here's what you need to know.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.040]   And I'm doing shows on that,
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.040]   but they become somewhat disjointed.
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.700]   And because I don't do a whole series five days in a row,
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.200]   they become a little bit disjointed.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.840]   So what I've recognized is I think
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.680]   that the very motivated do-it-yourselfer
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.000]   will be able to get out of the show
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.360]   enough of the information that they need
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.400]   to do it themselves,
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.880]   but that there's a real need for me
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:13.280]   to create these additional focused value-added products
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:18.200]   for those whose time is limited,
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:22.760]   who can't listen to the comprehensive content
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.760]   that I have developed here.
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.600]   They need just a specific answer.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:28.920]   And so I'm studying,
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:33.120]   and I've set out a studying process for myself this year.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.800]   I'm gonna study all the major people
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.580]   in the financial advice business.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.760]   I'm gonna read their books again.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.240]   I'm gonna look at what they're doing
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:43.520]   and how they're doing it and try to learn.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.440]   So I'm gonna study Dave Ramsey.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.520]   I'm gonna try to understand more of his history,
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.160]   understand more of how he developed his,
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.000]   the approach he took to developing things,
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.520]   David Box, Suze Orman, Jim Cramer, Clark Howard.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.320]   I'm gonna focus on what are they doing
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.520]   and how did they do it,
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.160]   and try to understand what they're doing.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.940]   'Cause essentially, the difference between my show
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:05.440]   that I envision and many other podcasts
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.760]   is I'm trying to create something
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:11.100]   that's more along the lines of radio than podcasting.
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.480]   I don't know if I can do it successfully,
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:15.320]   but that's the,
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.720]   that's kind of where I'm going to
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.140]   for my learning and understanding.
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:21.440]   And I'm gonna try to understand
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.520]   how did these people have created their content
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.360]   and applied it.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.040]   I have some others as well.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.360]   I'm gonna read through this year
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.360]   all of Nick Murray's archives,
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:33.420]   all of Joshua Kennan's archives,
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.840]   and so, and just try to understand
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.440]   what are they doing well,
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.680]   and how can I learn from what they're doing.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.280]   I'm also going to spend a lot of time
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.800]   consuming the body of work
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.680]   of some people who aren't specifically in
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:51.360]   the financial space.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.740]   And the people that I've chosen here,
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:55.720]   well, one other who's in the financial space,
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.680]   I'm gonna consume Ramit Sethi's work.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.160]   He's the guy who writes the site,
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.880]   "I Will Teach You to Be Rich."
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:06.040]   And his stuff's never really clicked with me,
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.800]   but it seems to be very effective
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.080]   with his core audience.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.400]   So I'm gonna consume his work.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.240]   And then I'm also gonna study through
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:19.680]   what Dan Miller is doing with "48 Days,"
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:24.260]   and also what Michael Hyatt does with his ventures.
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:27.080]   And neither of those men,
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.480]   their content has never really appealed to me.
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:30.940]   I've kind of not really understood
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:33.180]   why they're so effective.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:36.920]   Dan Miller less than Michael Hyatt.
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:38.000]   I've liked Dan Miller's stuff.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.400]   It just didn't really appeal to me that much
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:43.680]   as far as just the need that I've had necessarily.
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:47.440]   But Michael Hyatt, I've never understood
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.200]   why is he as popular as he is?
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:53.440]   People, the weirdest people in my life are fans of his.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.900]   And he seems to be just so effective
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:57.560]   at building his business.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:59.320]   And so I'm gonna study his work,
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:02.000]   and I like him, but I don't know.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.200]   I just don't have that same feeling
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.420]   that a lot of other people have.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:06.520]   But I'm gonna go through and try to work my way through
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.840]   and understand what it is that he does so well.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.080]   Because he certainly seems,
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.620]   the marketplace is really benefiting
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:15.400]   from what he's doing, it seems.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.580]   And then Dan Miller, I like Dan Miller,
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:19.620]   I like his grandfatherly attitude.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:22.300]   I don't personally click a lot
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:26.380]   with the young, aggressive, single,
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.740]   23-year-old internet hotshot.
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.500]   It doesn't, that doesn't appeal to me.
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:32.660]   It's fine for other people,
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:33.940]   that doesn't really appeal to me.
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:38.940]   I like the gentle, humble, people like Dan Miller.
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.900]   And the other thing that I've been working
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:42.880]   on Dan Miller's work is I've realized
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.120]   that much of what I do with financial planning,
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.300]   the weak point is the coaching.
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:49.760]   That's the weak point with financial planning
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:51.740]   is you need to have those coaching skills.
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:54.020]   And he's widely regarded as having
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:57.660]   a well-constructed coaching platform
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.420]   to teach people how to become coaches.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.560]   So I'm gonna join all of these people's programs,
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.860]   I'm gonna learn and consume their content
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.500]   and just really strive to understand
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.820]   what they're doing so well.
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.960]   And then replicate the good things
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.360]   that I like from their models into this show.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.900]   So that's some of how I'm applying this
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.660]   to be the world-class financial education site.
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.820]   And I'm way behind on the things
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:25.400]   that I've intended to do with each of those aspects.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.900]   But I've got the plan laid out
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.940]   and gotta get stuff done.
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.180]   So that's the plan.
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.520]   Number of other areas that are on my goals
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.500]   and we'll start to wrap up.
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.420]   But I'm gonna just share with you a few other things.
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:40.820]   For example, one of my major focuses,
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:43.320]   two of my major focuses of additional skills
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:48.920]   are my own writing abilities and my speaking abilities.
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:49.980]   Let's start with speaking.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.100]   I have given a couple of speeches in the last six months.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.100]   And one of the things that really frustrated with me
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:59.060]   was how uncomfortable I was doing it.
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.300]   Once upon a time, I was very comfortable
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:05.840]   being able to give a compelling speech
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.780]   on a specific topic that was useful for the audience
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:10.620]   and to feel comfortable doing that.
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.420]   Well, the two of the speeches that I've made recently,
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:13.620]   I just really wasn't comfortable
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.140]   and I didn't feel like I had done a very good
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.580]   and effective job with it.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:20.580]   And I really wish to start developing
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:23.460]   some of that content for the different format
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.780]   and just the podcasting format
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.740]   for the verbal spoken content.
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.360]   So I need to work on my skills.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:32.440]   So this year I'm gonna be rejoining Toastmasters.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.900]   And I spent several years in Toastmasters in the past,
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.100]   but this time I'm gonna be joining
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.980]   what's called a Toastmasters Advanced Club.
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:41.420]   And quick primer for you on Toastmasters,
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:43.260]   'cause I think it's such a useful organization.
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:47.500]   It's widely regarded by many people
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.360]   as having just the perfect curriculum
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.160]   for learning public speaking skills.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:56.340]   And so it starts with most clubs are just basic clubs
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:59.220]   and you'll have everyone from real experts in there
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.220]   to rank amateurs who are completely uncomfortable.
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.060]   I mean, they're just,
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:06.740]   they basically could get up and stammer their first speech.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.740]   And what's really beautiful
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.540]   is Toastmasters has a comprehensive curriculum
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.540]   to take you from an initial speech
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:16.860]   where you're completely uncomfortable
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:21.860]   to a comprehensive, beautifully well designed
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:25.160]   and delivered speech.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.820]   It starts with their initial manual is,
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:33.260]   the initial phase of achievement is to become a,
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.100]   what's it called?
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:37.260]   A competent communicator, I think is what they call it.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.100]   And so they give you,
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.460]   you start working your way through an initial manual
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.340]   that has 15 speeches.
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:47.140]   And each of the chapters in the manual
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:52.140]   has an instruction section,
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:55.060]   a few pages of here's how you construct a speech.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.700]   And then you prepare a speech
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:00.040]   focusing on that specific aspect of speaking.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.360]   So it begins with an icebreaker speech,
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.100]   then it moves on to how to be in earnest.
[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:07.420]   So how do you convey earnestness,
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.740]   sincerity, conviction, et cetera,
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:12.340]   speech organization, vocal variety, et cetera.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.260]   And there are 15 speeches.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.460]   And then once you do that,
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:17.260]   you've achieved the competent communicator
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.960]   first initial standard.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.980]   Then they have what are called advanced manuals.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:25.100]   And these advanced manuals cover many different topics.
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.660]   And so the club that I'm gonna be joining
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.980]   is an advanced club where all of the speakers
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:33.060]   and members of that club have at least achieved
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.960]   the minimum level of certification,
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.380]   the competent communicator certification.
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:38.900]   And based upon that,
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.740]   you have people who are more experienced at speaking
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:42.660]   and you can get a little bit deeper.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.140]   And I'm gonna be working my way through
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.140]   a few of the manuals.
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:50.200]   There are a total of something like 12 manuals
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.100]   that they have, I think, that are advanced speaking manuals.
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:59.100]   The ones that interest me are communicating on television
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.220]   'cause I wanna learn some of the specific skills
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:05.580]   for creating excellent television presentations.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.200]   I did a couple of things where I was televised
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.300]   for some things this year
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.820]   and it just really didn't feel like
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:12.860]   I did a very good job at it.
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:16.780]   The entertaining speaker manual,
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:20.420]   humorous speaking manual, persuasive speaking manual,
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:21.460]   professional speaking manual,
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.480]   speaking to inform storytelling,
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.500]   technical presentation,
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.820]   and then the special occasions speeches.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.820]   So each of those is a comprehensive manual
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:32.060]   where you go through different exercises
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.620]   and you prepare speeches
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.860]   based upon these specific requirements.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:39.700]   And that builds your ability to craft a speech
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:44.060]   that is focused on a unique occasion.
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:46.100]   They have other manuals as well
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:50.260]   that you can work through if they're of interest to you.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:52.740]   So the special occasions one is interesting.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.220]   How do you create a great toast?
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:56.220]   How do you give a praise speech?
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:57.340]   How do you do a roast?
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.800]   How do you roast somebody?
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.580]   How do you do an award acceptance speech?
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.860]   So you can prepare for these things
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.420]   and practice them in advance
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.580]   and that can extend your ability with speaking.
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.460]   So this is a focus of mine for 2015.
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:09.700]   I'm gonna rejoin this club
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:12.480]   and I'm gonna work my way through some of the manuals.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.220]   I've chosen the ones that I'm gonna start with
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:16.060]   and then we'll see.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:18.620]   I'm not gonna go just one manual at a time.
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.420]   And then that'll help me.
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:21.540]   I'll videotape those.
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.840]   I will use them as a learning experience
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:28.840]   and I will be able to assess my progress in that direction
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:33.460]   toward the need that I have
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:37.660]   of being able to deliver compelling financial presentations
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:40.860]   to educate people and help people in another forum.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.020]   Another area of focus for me is
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:46.580]   I'm gonna focus this year on being
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.860]   and becoming a world-class writer.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:52.140]   Writing has often been a weak point.
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.380]   I've mentioned on the show in the past,
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.220]   I haven't loved writing.
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.140]   But I've come to terms with the fact
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:59.340]   that it doesn't really matter whether I love it or not.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:00.620]   I've gotta do it.
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:05.180]   Because ideas that are communicated in print effectively
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:06.460]   are ideas that matter.
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:10.180]   When I think about the people that I introduce on the show
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.580]   and I think about, excuse me, that I interview on the show
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:15.500]   and I think about what they've been able to convey
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.660]   through their books and their written content
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:22.220]   as compared to in an interview format or in a speech,
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.820]   speeches are valuable but they're very different.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:25.980]   Podcasting is valuable.
[01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:27.540]   It's very different than writing.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.900]   And I need to focus on building my skill in this area.
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.000]   I need it to, I'm sure that at some point,
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   once I can figure out what's needed in the marketplace,
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.660]   clarify my own message, I'm sure I'll need to prepare it
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.680]   to write a book or two or something like that.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.460]   So I need to practice that now.
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:46.440]   But I also wanna model this skill for my son.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.720]   And I need to build my own productive output.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.300]   And this is only gonna come with practice.
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.240]   The only way I'm gonna become a better writer
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.360]   is by simply by writing.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:57.020]   And so I'm focusing on four different areas of writing.
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:59.680]   Number one is I need to dramatically improve
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.420]   the show notes that I create for radical personal finance.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.800]   And this is important for my marketing efforts for the show
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:10.460]   to help things be found, help the content be found.
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:13.560]   Number two is I need to focus on preparing
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.600]   some excellent guest posts and articles
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:20.080]   for broader publication as a marketing outlet for the show.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:24.320]   Additionally, I'm gonna prepare some of those separately,
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.600]   some of those be private, but then I'm also gonna start
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.720]   writing on joshuasheets.com to have an outlet
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.960]   for some of the things that are not necessarily
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.840]   appropriate for this show,
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.760]   but that I still have an interest on.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.360]   I need to be careful with the content
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.560]   that I present on radical personal finance.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.480]   When I get into some of the offbeat areas
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.960]   that I'm interested in, I can lose some people.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.400]   So if I talk about baby education,
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.200]   that's a real interest of mine,
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.800]   but it's only a real interest to some in the audience,
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.600]   maybe who are in similar stages.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.760]   So I'm gonna start and develop joshuasheets.com
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.880]   and start putting some of the information there,
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:58.960]   some of the things that I'm learning
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.160]   and sharing some of those things in that forum
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.680]   as an effort to focus my writing and work on that.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.480]   And then also, I'm gonna be working on creating products
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.240]   and manuals for the membership, the irregulars,
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.560]   here at Radical Personal Finance,
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.240]   and that's gonna be a lot of writing as well.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.560]   I don't plan to use any special tools.
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.960]   I don't need any coaches.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.440]   I'm just gonna write and read it
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.000]   and see how I'm doing on that
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.040]   and focus on how I'm, you know,
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.920]   just critiquing my own content.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.280]   And then also to be an effective writer,
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.400]   I need to continue to read and consume
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:33.840]   a wide range of content.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.880]   And so I've got an extensive reading list planned out,
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.240]   which I won't go into in depth at the moment,
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.160]   but things that are gonna influence the show
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.520]   and then also things that I am focused on as well.
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.980]   Couple of other quick areas.
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:49.040]   For example, I have all of my personal goals
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.160]   working towards complete debt freedom
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.420]   and financial independence.
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:55.960]   That has some aspects associated with it.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.020]   A major focus for me is my health.
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:03.120]   I'm about to turn 30 this summer,
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.720]   and over the last year, I've never felt,
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.840]   I've been overweight most of my life
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.200]   and have had various issues with,
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:14.160]   I've gained weight, lost weight,
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.400]   gained weight, lost weight, gained weight, lost weight.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.860]   And I've never really had any issues
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:19.880]   with being overweight though,
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.960]   but lately I'm just starting to feel old.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.680]   And I've done some things, worked hard over the last year
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.720]   on some different aspects of improving my health,
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.220]   and they've been less effective
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:31.000]   than I thought they should be.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.480]   And I won't go into detail
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:33.660]   on all these things at the moment,
[01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.760]   but I've done different exercise programs,
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:36.920]   I've done different ways of eating,
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.440]   and everything's been less effective
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.260]   than I thought it would be.
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:42.440]   So I've been really focusing on
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:47.440]   how do I build my health in a comprehensive way
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.600]   that's a sustainable way and a long-term
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.900]   that also integrates with all the other aspects of my life.
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:56.860]   And that comes down to quality, proper food and nutrition.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:00.140]   That comes down to proper movement that's fun,
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.940]   proper exercise, proper physical structure,
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.780]   my mental health, things like that.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:07.040]   And so it's a real focus for me.
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.300]   I'll talk more about that some other time,
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.000]   probably on another forum.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.240]   Some of the members of the audience
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.100]   have shared some resources with me and I thank you.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:13.940]   One of the things I'm gonna do
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:15.100]   is I'm gonna get some testing done.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.740]   I think I might have some kind of, I don't know,
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:19.780]   thyroid issue, 'cause I'm gonna get some testing done
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:24.500]   and see if I have some issues there.
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:28.140]   And then I'm a world-class husband and a world-class father
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.240]   and I've got different things associated with those.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.120]   And then with my spiritual life,
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:38.020]   I'm changing with my own focus and relationship with God.
[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:41.460]   I'm changing a couple of things that I'm doing
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.260]   with my own personal study.
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:48.260]   I'm using this year, I read the Bible a lot
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:53.260]   and other resources as well on a wide range of subjects,
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:56.500]   which too comprehensive and not necessarily focused
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.460]   on this type of target.
[01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:00.020]   But one of the things I've done in years past,
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.920]   I've read through the Bible several times,
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:05.140]   but this year I'm focusing on taking a different approach
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.540]   and I'm doing it book by book,
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.000]   focusing on one book for a month,
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.620]   reading through the book many times
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:13.500]   and understanding how each book of the Bible fits together.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.500]   And I'm using as an outline some materials.
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.140]   If you're interested, you can find them online
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:20.800]   called "Unlocking the Bible"
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.820]   and it's by a man named David Pawson.
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:26.100]   And he teaches through each chap,
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.740]   excuse me, each book of the Bible.
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:28.900]   And this is a real weak point
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.660]   with my own personal knowledge and understanding
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:33.300]   of how do these different books fit together.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.940]   And I get the comprehensive view,
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:38.020]   but what I'm interested in now is understanding
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.060]   how each book of the Bible works together.
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:41.980]   And so I'm making a major focus
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.040]   of taking that type of approach
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.220]   where I'm specifically focusing, for example,
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:50.900]   in January, reading through Matthew multiple, multiple times
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:51.960]   at the moment about once a day.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.100]   And then in February, I'm gonna go to Genesis
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.580]   and I'm gonna go Old New Testament,
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.660]   work my way through using his content as an outline
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.560]   to really understand how each of the books
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.940]   of the Bible fits together.
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:04.060]   So I'm pretty excited about that.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:07.220]   That is really great.
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:08.700]   That's a good thing for us.
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:12.980]   In closing, I want to share just an idea
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.700]   of how to integrate these things
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:16.940]   and in hopes that it'll inspire you.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.700]   'Cause it probably, I mean, it sounds like a lot.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.500]   I'm a little bit daunted when I look at my lists.
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.220]   And again, I don't expect to ever finish everything.
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:27.380]   I'm done with this whole idea
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:28.980]   of you gotta do something to perfection.
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:30.500]   Everything's gotta be done.
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.380]   Hey, you do the best you can, you just work at it
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:34.300]   and you have fun and enjoy the process.
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.300]   But at least with an outlined plan and a general roadmap,
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.460]   I think it's more likely that I will be able
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:44.180]   to make progress toward my goals.
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.300]   One of the things, however, is I think a lot
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.640]   about how to integrate things.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.260]   How do I integrate different of these ideas?
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.140]   So let me give you an example.
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:55.780]   I just talked a little bit about health and exercise.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:58.700]   I've done different things throughout my life,
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.180]   including this past year, I joined, again,
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.660]   a local CrossFit gym.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:05.140]   I enjoy kind of not having to think about things,
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.820]   just having a curriculum laid out.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.600]   I enjoy working hard.
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.940]   So I joined a local CrossFit gym for a couple months.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:11.940]   Did not work for me.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:13.980]   It hadn't worked for me in the past,
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:14.820]   but it did not work for me,
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.340]   not necessarily from an exercise standpoint,
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.620]   but it didn't fit with my life
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:20.380]   because it required me to leave my house
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:23.660]   and leave my family for an hour worth of working out
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.920]   and a half hour on getting ready and getting home.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.140]   And that's an hour and a half out of my day.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.260]   That's a valuable hour and a half.
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:33.060]   So what I've spent a lot of time this year thinking about
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:36.580]   is how can I build things where there's synergy?
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:40.060]   So for example, I'm working on,
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:44.540]   I'm gonna be doing an in-home exercise program
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.820]   so that I can do it with my wife and with my son.
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:49.620]   And that way, everyone's together.
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:52.340]   I'm building on my responsibilities
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.980]   to be a world-class husband and a world-class father,
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:59.020]   but I'm also building world-class health at the same time
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.740]   because of the time spent together.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:04.380]   Or one of the routines that I'm putting into my day
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:08.860]   is following lunch to walk with my son to the local park
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:12.100]   and get out, get some sunshine, get some exercise.
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:16.980]   And then by being outside, I can get exercise
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:18.180]   and I can spend time with him.
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:20.420]   I can spend time talking with my wife,
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:24.700]   having a lot of focused, intimate conversation.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.880]   And that way, things build on each other.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.340]   When I'm building as a,
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.140]   if I'm working at Toastmasters
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:35.620]   and I'm focusing on becoming a world-class speaker,
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:39.100]   in order for me to do that,
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:42.420]   I need to prepare an outline and a goal and a focus.
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.740]   Well, that outline could very well be written
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:48.280]   as a useful blog post or article,
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.180]   which is posted on Radical Personal Finance
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:52.420]   or at joshuasheets.com.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:56.500]   It could also be used as training
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:00.500]   for creating a more effective podcast presentation.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.460]   And it could also be a component of a podcast presentation
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:07.500]   so that I can create content that I can release on the feed
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.100]   when I'm out of town, perhaps,
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.720]   to continue maintaining regular content.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.580]   Debt-free and financial independence,
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.460]   I get to research that stuff
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:21.460]   and focus on perfecting my own personal systems
[01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:24.860]   while creating content to help other people
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:27.060]   perfect their own systems.
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:29.900]   And that builds my mental health
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:34.740]   and my enjoyment of the content,
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:37.340]   of learning it and conveying it.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:38.900]   'Cause to me, that's fun.
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.700]   I love to teach and I love to convey the information.
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:44.580]   So all of these things add on top of each other.
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:45.860]   I can listen to,
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:48.740]   as I'm building Radical Personal Finance
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:52.180]   into a world-class financial education site,
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.980]   I can listen to Dave Ramsey
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:55.480]   and I can understand what does he do so well
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.060]   as a broadcaster where people enjoy listening
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.100]   to him so much.
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.060]   And then I can say,
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.940]   what does he do so well as a business owner
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:05.500]   and what does he do so well as a marketer?
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.860]   And I can narrow in on those things
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:10.660]   and that affects each aspect of my life.
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:13.140]   So what I love and where I like to think about
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:15.940]   is how can we get a lot of synergy
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:19.500]   from different areas of focus and build things together?
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:22.220]   And hopefully some of the ideas that I'm working on
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:24.060]   for my life coming forward over this next year
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:25.200]   will be useful to you.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.420]   That's it for today's show.
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:29.700]   I thank each and every one of you for listening.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:30.540]   Hope this has been useful.
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:31.460]   A little bit more personal.
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:34.180]   And one of the things that I'm doing also
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:37.860]   is working to do less of the show,
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:42.180]   like the behind the scenes on the public feed,
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.340]   creating more additional content for the member program
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:47.700]   where I'm gonna do more of sharing
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.340]   what's actually going on with behind the scenes on the show.
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:53.020]   But I'm gonna start to do a better job
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.540]   of keeping the lines more,
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:58.380]   it's a little bit stronger
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.060]   between the public facing information
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:01.820]   and the private facing information.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:05.980]   Thank you all for listening.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:09.740]   It's been an awesome, 2014 was an incredible year for me.
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:14.300]   2015, I'm more excited about 2015 than I've ever been.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.020]   I think it's gonna be really, really fun.
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:18.780]   I'm enjoying learning all these new skills.
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:22.900]   I'm enjoying having the opportunity to just improve
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:23.740]   and to get better.
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:25.340]   And to me, that's fun.
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.420]   Learning is so neat.
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:28.980]   It's a lot of hard work sometimes,
[01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:31.060]   but I'm in it for the marathon
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:32.700]   and I'm just enjoying the process.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.700]   Thank you to each one of you who have left reviews
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:37.980]   and who have joined the membership program
[01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:40.980]   over the past couple of weeks as I've been out.
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:45.580]   I appreciate each one of you investing in me.
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:49.820]   And it's so nice to have customers, paying customers,
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:52.740]   'cause that puts such an incredible responsibility on me
[01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:54.620]   to say, I need to ship some stuff here,
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:57.100]   some additional benefits that are gonna be world-class.
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.180]   And I've got a bunch of ideas on that.
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:02.180]   I will be putting a lot of that behind the scenes
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.060]   as I learn to get the technology.
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:06.620]   I got really waylaid with the technology stuff,
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:08.220]   thinking about outsourcing it.
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:09.980]   But as I figure out how to do it better,
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:11.980]   I'm gonna be putting a lot of that stuff behind the scenes,
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.860]   creating some private user forums, things like that,
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:17.140]   where I'll be spending a lot of time.
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:20.540]   Big plans coming, details coming in the future.
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:21.620]   Thank you for being here.
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:22.460]   Happy New Year.
