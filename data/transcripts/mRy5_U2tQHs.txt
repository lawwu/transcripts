[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Well, we have addressed the topic of cremation on the podcast back in episode 874.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.120]   We have addressed the topic of giving the body to science back in episode 406.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.920]   But what if you give your body to science and that program cremates the remains they
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.480]   don't need or use by way of a standard policy?
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.480]   Here's the exact question.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.520]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.600]   I'm a nurse at the local university medical center and I'm considering donating my body
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.800]   to them when I die.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.280]   After they harvest organs and tissues, the rest of the body is cremated.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.640]   In the APJ episode on cremation, you said that this was not an edifying option for Christians.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.960]   I'm seeking your wisdom on this situation.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.200]   Number one, is it virtuous for Christians to donate their organs and tissues for medical
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.280]   use and number two, is cremation less of a concern in such a situation?"
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:01.880]   To set the stage for my answer, let me review my reasons for encouraging Christians not
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.200]   to cremate but to bury their loved ones.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.800]   And if people want the whole argument, they should see Desiring God, the article is entitled
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.760]   Should Christians Cremate Their Loved Ones?
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.360]   I argued that two focuses of Scripture lead away from burning to burying for Christians,
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.720]   namely one, the preciousness of the human body as God's creation and purchase by the
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.160]   blood of his Son and his possession.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.160]   We're not our own.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.360]   We're bought with a price now and forever.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.760]   That's the first emphasis.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.680]   The second is the dreadfulness of fire as it relates to the human body, especially after
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.680]   death.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.080]   So those two biblical emphases disincline me from encouraging people to use cremation.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.440]   I don't care how cheap or convenient it may seem.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.280]   The early Christians in the New Testament buried their loved ones, encouraged to do
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.040]   it by two apostolic symbols implied in burying.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.880]   One was sowing seed, and the other was laying to rest.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.520]   For example, what is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable, 1 Corinthians 15:42.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.560]   So the body is sown like a seed, and it comes up out of the ground at the resurrection imperishable.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.840]   That's the first picture.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.920]   And the other one is we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.480]   not precede those who have fallen asleep.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:51.680]   So handling the body in a way that is a precious gift from God is that we handled it like a
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.720]   seed sown in the ground and like a person being laid to sleep to be awakened from their
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.800]   sleep by the resurrection.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.600]   The other focus of Scripture that pointed to burying rather than burning the body is
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.640]   the meaning of fire as it relates to the human body now and in the life to come.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:22.960]   In the Bible, the use of fire to consume the body on earth was seen as a sign of contempt.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.880]   Never a blessing to have your body burned.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.640]   It was not a glorious treatment of the body, but a contemptuous one.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.760]   Early Christians believed in the judgment of God after death, Hebrews 9, 27, and the
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.280]   most dreadful picture of that judgment was fire.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.240]   Hell is a place of fire, according to Matthew 5, 22 and James 3, 6.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.240]   This fire is meant to be felt by the body.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.360]   We're cast as bodies into hell fire, Jesus said.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.200]   He was able to kill both body and soul in hell.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.000]   Therefore, the early Christians shrunk back in horror from exposing the precious blood-bought
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.040]   body of a believer that would be revived, renewed, raised, and glorious forever.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.420]   They shrunk back from exposing the body to fire, which was like exposing it to hell.
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:31.520]   That was my double argument against cremation, besides some really pragmatic ones like, "You'll
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.160]   never know whether those are your loved ones' ashes."
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:43.560]   But now the questions are, one, is it virtuous for Christians to donate their organs and
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.560]   tissues for medical use, and is cremation less of a concern in this case of what parts
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.520]   of the body are left over to be disposed of?
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.120]   My answer is yes to both of those questions.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.960]   If the heart is humble and trusting God's mercy rather than proud and seeking to score
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.280]   points with God and man.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.000]   You can donate your body and be an arrogant person trying to earn God's favor, but I'm
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.680]   assuming that's not at all the case here.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:26.320]   So first, I would note that from the earliest times, Christian martyrs have been willing
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.160]   to be burned alive.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:36.160]   First Corinthians 13, 3, "Though I give my body to be burned," rather than deny the faith.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:44.080]   Now this means that there are higher values than avoiding being burned to ashes, like
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.800]   not forsaking the faith, not bringing reproach upon the Savior.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:57.720]   From this, I would infer that there are other values that might override the ordinary way
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.160]   Christians show honor to the body in burial.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:10.480]   And one of those would be the conviction that offering our bodies to medical science may
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:19.800]   serve the discovery of some disease-healing drug, or may provide an organ transplant that
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.560]   could save a person who's about to die on dialysis, or something like that.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:33.240]   So the value of loving others in this way may override the value of burying the body,
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.120]   in its entirety at least.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:42.160]   Then our nurse friend asks, after they harvest the organs or the tissues or whatever they're
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:48.760]   going to use for good purposes, "The rest of the body is cremated," she says, and that
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:55.120]   would be part of the price we may be willing to pay to do the good that we believe God
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.480]   is calling us to do.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.920]   I don't know enough here to make pronouncements.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:07.000]   I don't know the ins and outs of the process of using a body for medical research or for
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.640]   organ transplanting, but I would at least raise the question whether it might be possible
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.360]   to still bury the body.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:24.920]   There have been examples in the Bible and in history where bodies have been mutilated
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:33.440]   and parts have been severed, and families have longed to have any remnant of their loved
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.000]   one's body that they could honor in burial.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.080]   Whether this is possible will depend on the process.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.240]   I know nothing about it.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.240]   I can't say.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.480]   She would probably know better than I.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.400]   But it might bear significant testimony—if we did it that way, it might bear significant
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:01.040]   testimony to the medical community and professionals—if Christians gave a biblical reason for why
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:08.000]   they would like to proceed with some kind of burial after medical use of the body that
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.760]   they can use.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:16.520]   But putting all that uncertainty aside, my answer would be yes.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:23.640]   If we act from faith, it can be a beautiful act of love for Christians to donate their
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.040]   organs and tissues for medical use.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:32.680]   And yes, cremation, while not ideal, may carry new meaning under those circumstances.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.200]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.360]   And thanks for listening.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.480]   Again, we address cremation more generally back in episode number 406, and in episode
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.920]   874, we talked about giving the body to science.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.680]   To find those episodes, go to our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn and type
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.080]   "cremation" in the search bar.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.000]   Well over 90 times the Apostle Paul speaks of the flesh.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.760]   So what does this keyword mean for him?
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.600]   It's a shrewd and important question for any Bible reader to get clear on.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.800]   What does Paul mean by flesh?
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   We'll tackle that next time.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   I'm your host Tony Ranke.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.480]   We'll see you on Wednesday.
