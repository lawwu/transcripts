[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.880]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, chapter 5 and verse 5, the fifth verse in the fifth
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.280]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:24.720]   "For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man who is an
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:34.080]   idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:42.680]   We come to these most solemn words as a part of our consideration of the teaching of this
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.900]   early portion in this fifth chapter of this epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:56.920]   Here we have found that the apostle tells us that we must no longer live the kind of
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.440]   life we were living before.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.760]   There are certain things from which the Christian man, the Christian believer, is to separate
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.560]   himself or herself once and forever.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:18.260]   But fornication and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.700]   saints, neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient, but
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.000]   rather giving of thanks.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   For this ye know.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.140]   And then comes this alarming statement.
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.300]   Now we have divided up this matter in this way, that we have considered what we are not
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.140]   to do.
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.380]   We have then considered positively what we are to do as Christians.
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.700]   We have gone over the things that we are to leave behind us once and forever.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.180]   We are not even to talk about them, not to hint at them, not to play with them even in
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.180]   the imagination.
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.220]   We are to have nothing to do with them.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.300]   And then we have considered positively, I say, well, the kind of conversation particularly
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.100]   that we are to indulge in and how we are to use our money, speaking generally.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.740]   And then we came to the third matter, which was this.
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.740]   Why?
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.740]   Why are we called upon thus, to forsake certain things and renounce them forever, and to do
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.980]   certain other things?
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.860]   And we are in the process of considering the reasons.
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.540]   The apostle says that we are saints.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.500]   We are saints.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.000]   We are people set apart by God.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.900]   We are holy people.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.880]   You cannot be a Christian without being a saint.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.260]   So the man who says, well, yes, I am a Christian, but I am not much of a saint, you know, is
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.320]   a man who is denying and contradicting himself.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.740]   Every Christian is called to be a saint.
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.160]   The very genius of Protestantism is to reject those artificial and false distinctions that
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.540]   ever have characterized the Catholic approach to truth.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.540]   That is quite unscriptural.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.100]   It is not New Testament.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.460]   That is men.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.540]   That is to make it easier for us.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.140]   There are these people who take up the Christian life as a vocation, and they become monks
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.940]   and so on, and they are canonized and made saints, some of them.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.300]   But then there is the ordinary Christian, and he prays to the saints.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.680]   He believes in supererogation.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.060]   Some men have so lived the Christian life that they have not only satisfied God for
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.740]   themselves, they have got an overplus, and you pray to them and ask them to give you
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.500]   a little of their supererogation.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.540]   That is all unscriptural.
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.720]   We are all saints, set apart by God, a people for his own peculiar possession.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.020]   We are holy people.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.960]   That is the meaning of the word saint.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.980]   Like the vessels that were set apart in the tabernacle in the temple of old, they were
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.820]   called holy vessels, holiness unto the Lord was written upon them.
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.260]   And so, this is the position of all of us who claim to be Christians.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.380]   And then he goes on to say, as we saw, that this kind of old conduct, therefore, is not
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.380]   becoming.
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.620]   It does not fit in with, does not match, does not suit, is not convenient with the life
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.140]   of people who thus have been made saints and holy ones.
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.660]   And then we saw also how he makes this point, that covetousness in particular is a form
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:39.180]   of idolatry, and any form of idolatry is the greatest conceivable insult to God.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.660]   If we are making any idols in our hearts, it does not matter what it is, not only money,
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.900]   anything, anything that we bow down before it in worship, anything that absorbs our interest
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.900]   and attention, well, that is an idol, that is something which we are worshipping.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.020]   We are giving it the first place in our lives, we are making it central, that is idolatry.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.420]   And there is nothing more abominable in the sight of God than idolatry.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.700]   Very well, there are some of his reasons, and now we come to this further reason.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.660]   The apostle just cannot leave it at that.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.860]   He shows how utterly incompatible such conduct is, how unthinkable it ought to be, therefore.
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:30.180]   But he must go a step further, and he introduces this most solemn warning, this alarming pronouncement
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.540]   that we are looking at together this morning, "This ye know, that no whoremonger, nor
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:45.800]   unclean person, nor covetous man who is an idolater, hath any inheritance, any place
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.640]   at all in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.260]   Very well, here is a warning, then, that we have got to face, and we have got to take
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.500]   Scripture as it is.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:08.580]   The apostle felt it necessary to administer this severe warning to these Ephesian Christians,
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:15.120]   and therefore it is necessary as a warning to Christians in all ages and in all places,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.120]   everywhere.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.220]   Let us look, then, briefly at what he has to say.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.140]   We cannot but notice, first of all, the way in which he presents this warning.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:32.240]   "This ye know," he says, "you know this."
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.860]   What he means is that this is something beyond any doubt, beyond any paradventure, beyond
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.860]   any disputation.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.800]   This, he says, is something that is self-evident.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.980]   He is saying, in effect, that really you cannot be a Christian without knowing this.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.860]   It is something that is so perfectly obvious.
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:03.140]   It should be something that needs no demonstration at all for any person who is truly Christian.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.640]   "This," he says, "you know.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.060]   You must know it.
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.700]   How can you be a Christian at all without knowing this?
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:18.020]   How can you have learned Christ in any real sense without being aware of this at once?"
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.340]   He says you need no instruction about it, and yet, though he says that, he does remind
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.940]   them of it.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:32.460]   Very well, then, I say, this comes to us as a question.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.980]   Do we all know this?
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.200]   Are we all perfectly clear about this?
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.100]   Is this something that needs no demonstration or explication to the modern Christian?
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:50.380]   Well, I can but answer by saying this, that though the apostle says here, as he says in
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.980]   many other places, that this is something that ought to be self-evidentâ€”you cannot
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.660]   read his epistles, nor indeed any of the writings of the New Testament, without being struck
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:07.060]   by the fact that the writers are constantly reminding people of this, and doing so in
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.340]   a most solemn manner.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:15.980]   In other words, the position must be this, that there are so many of us who ought to
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.300]   know these things but who do not know them.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.620]   It ought to be self-evident, but it is not always self-evident, and that is why we have
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.860]   to go into these things in detail.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.780]   We cannot skip over them and take them for granted and say, "Well, of course we do
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.740]   know that."
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.100]   The question is, I say, do we know it?
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:42.860]   Now, why is there this terrible possibility of our, as it were, knowing it theoretically
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.700]   and yet not truly knowing it, and understanding it, and grasping it?
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.460]   Haven't you often been surprised at this?
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.460]   People are surprised.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.740]   People come to me sometimes and say, "But fancy having to preach on that to Christian
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.740]   people."
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.940]   Well, my only answer is, the apostles did that, and if it was necessary then, it is
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.500]   necessary now, and it is not difficult to know why it is always necessary.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.020]   Here is one reason.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:18.500]   We all tend to be so subjective in our approach to this question of salvation and of redemption.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:24.460]   I mean by that that we always start with ourselves, and so often we end with ourselves.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:30.620]   We want something, and especially we want happiness, and we regard the gospel as something
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.700]   that is just designed to help us with our problem of seeking for happiness.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.320]   And it is because we start with ourselves in that way, and with this question of happiness,
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:48.700]   and never look at the whole position objectively, that we tend to get into this difficulty.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:55.180]   We want something, and we dictate what the something is; it is purely subjective.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:00.820]   And the result is, I say, that we forget this other aspect that is infinitely more important,
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:08.340]   which is our relationship to God and our standing in his most holy sight.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.300]   It is the danger, then, of being purely subjective in our approach.
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.180]   And then another reason is this.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:21.380]   We are all, of course, such experts at rationalizing our own sins and failures.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:27.020]   Oh, we recognize a thing in somebody else and we condemn it, but somehow or another,
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:33.060]   and we do the same thing, well, there is an explanation, and it can be put so easily,
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.820]   and we are perfectly satisfied.
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:42.260]   We are all experts at that process which is called rationalizing our own sins and misdeeds
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.260]   and failures.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.900]   We are all on very good terms with ourselves.
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.760]   We don't like to be made miserable.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.820]   We don't like condemnation.
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.760]   And therefore, we are experts, I say, at deducing reasons and arguments and explanations.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.700]   The thing really wasn't quite what it appeared to be, and so we end on good terms with ourselves.
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:06.880]   Once you go along that subjective road, it's astounding how brilliant you can become at
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.540]   protecting yourself and your own interests.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:14.400]   The Apostle says, you remember, in writing to the Romans in the second chapter, we either
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.080]   excuse or accuse.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:23.640]   In this respect, we excuse ourselves, we accuse others about the selfsame things.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:31.180]   Very well, there's a second reason, but of course, at the back of it all, is the subtlety
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:39.600]   of the devil, who can come to us as a friend, indeed, as an angel of light, and can so easily
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:46.820]   persuade us, because we want to be persuaded, that what we have first of all accused ourselves
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.840]   for as a sin is not really a sin at all.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.780]   It was just something natural, it was all right.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.800]   We were being over-punctilious, we'd become hypersensitive in our consciences, we developed
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:06.120]   a kind of morbid scrupulosity, and so he comes and he puts it so plausibly, and we, I say,
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.680]   want to be convinced of this, we want to be right with ourselves.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:15.760]   And so the devil comes and twists, and thus God's people are blinded to what they're
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:21.280]   doing, and they get into a state in which it is necessary that the Apostles should address
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.840]   them in the terms of this verse that we're looking at together this morning.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:33.160]   Very well, there is a need for us, constantly, to look at these great statements of the Scripture
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.480]   about the ultimate object of Christianity.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.600]   What is the ultimate object of this Christian message, this Christian faith?
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.280]   And there can be only one answer to this.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.120]   It is to make us holy, not to make us happy.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.760]   Happiness is a by-product in Christianity, it's not the central thing.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.240]   Now, we can never emphasize that too much.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.600]   It is the differentiating point between Christianity and the cults.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:09.880]   Let me use the technical term, it is the differentia of the Christian faith.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:17.320]   Here, the first thing is holiness; in all the others, it's happiness.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.920]   You examine them, and you'll find that they're always ministering to your happiness.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.640]   They're not concerned about your holiness.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.760]   They want you to get rid of this, that, or the other.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.800]   Yes, but do they want you to get rid of sin?
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.080]   Many of them don't even recognize the category of sin at all.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:43.800]   But here, the first thing, the big thing, the central thing, is that we be made holy.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.480]   And that, you see, is the great argument of the twelfth chapter of the epistle to the
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.520]   Hebrews, isn't it?
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:55.160]   It's because the Lord loves us that he chastens us and makes us unhappy for the time being.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.160]   Why?
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.680]   Well, he's concerned about our holiness.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.520]   He wants us to be perfect.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.920]   He's preparing us for himself and his own life.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:10.720]   Therefore, holiness must be of necessity, the first thing and the most important thing.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.560]   So we can never too frequently look at statements such as this that's engaging our attention
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.320]   at this moment.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.960]   The thing we need to do increasingly, in other words, is to look at God and at his view of
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.520]   and his attitude towards sin and evil.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.000]   Let's forget ourselves for the time being.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.120]   We start with God, and we've come into his presence.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:41.800]   We are looking at him, and what matters is what he thinks and says about evil and sin
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:47.440]   and wrongdoing and life and living, not what I feel or my comfort or what anybody else
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.440]   says to me.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.440]   It's God.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:56.440]   Now then, this verse helps us to do that very thing.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.960]   And let's look at it, therefore, in this way.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:07.200]   Let us observe the frequency with which this statement that is made in our text this morning
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.520]   is made in the Scripture.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.560]   It's quite astonishing.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.360]   Take for instance that example of it there in the first epistle to the Corinthians, chapter
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:27.440]   6, verse 9 and following, which we read just now, "Know ye not," says the apostle, "that
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.780]   the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:39.880]   Be ye not deceived, neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.680]   themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor revilers, nor drunkards, nor
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.600]   extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:54.200]   There it is, in its most sullen form once more.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:00.880]   And you remember how, even in that great fifteenth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:07.880]   he says it again, verses 33-34, "Be ye not deceived, evil communications, corrupt good
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:14.320]   manners, awake to righteousness, and sin not, for some have not the knowledge of God.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.440]   I speak this to you ashamed."
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.320]   And then there is a mighty dissertation on this subject, you remember, in the second
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:30.360]   epistle to the Corinthians, in chapter 6, listen to this, "Be ye not unequally yoked
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.960]   together with unbelievers?
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:37.000]   For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.240]   Answer that.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.560]   What communion hath light with darkness?
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.600]   Who can tell me?
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.480]   What conquered hath Christ with Belial?
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.040]   What part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.680]   What agreement hath the temple of God with idol?"
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.240]   There are the questions.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:04.720]   And the questions are put, of course, to show that there is no fellowship, no agreement
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   at all.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:10.600]   The things are eternal incompatibilities and can never be brought together.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:16.040]   There is no mean between these two opposites, if I may quote Aristotle.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.560]   These things are eternal antitheses.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.120]   There can never be any grey in the realm where God reigns.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:30.640]   It is one or the other, it is black or white, and they never can be mixed.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:37.680]   And then you remember the apostle John, he teaches precisely the same thing.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.080]   Listen to him in his first epistle, in the first chapter, saying, "If we say that we
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:50.400]   are fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the truth.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.520]   If any men say," he says in the second chapter, in the fourth verse, "If any men say, 'I
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:03.800]   know him and keep not his commandments,'" you remember what he says about him?
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.000]   "He is a liar."
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.520]   There's nothing else to say about him, he's just a bare-faced liar.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.280]   The truth is not in him, he's a stranger to it.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:22.240]   And then you go on, you see, to the very last book of the Bible, as if to remind us just
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.160]   at the very end, we are so prone to forget all this, the book of Revelation, chapter
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:33.960]   21, verse 27, "And there shall in no wise enter into it the holy city, anything that
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:41.400]   defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie, but they only which are
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:47.960]   written in the lambs' book of life," and take the very last chapter of the Bible, verses
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:55.040]   14 and 15, "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have a right to
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:10.940]   For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:19.080]   loveth and maketh a lie," oh, this is an eternal distinction, "without."
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.700]   There they are, these people that he's talking about, that have no inheritance in the kingdom
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:31.880]   of Christ and of God, they're without, and outside eternally, and there they remain.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:20:00.960]   They have no entrance into this holy city.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.240]   My dear friends, this is Christianity.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.700]   This is New Testament Christianity, and there it is so plain and clear.
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.220]   You see, we're not thinking about our own happiness or subjective feelings, are we?
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.240]   Here is a great, objective, eternal statement.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.840]   There is a city to enter.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.620]   We want to enter the city, do we?
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:29.480]   Very well then, remember it's a holy city, and that the entrance to that city is controlled
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:41.160]   by this category of holiness, "without holiness no man shall see the Lord."
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.960]   Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God, and nobody else.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.000]   Well now then, there you are, there are the scriptures.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.680]   You see the abundance of the quotations, and I'm merely selecting some in passing.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.680]   Now then, the first question that confronts us is this.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.360]   What exactly then does this statement mean?
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.120]   Well, it means this.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:17.100]   The apostle is asserting that anyone whose habitual conduct is this, hath no inheritance
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.160]   in the kingdom of God.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:28.760]   He's saying that a man whose whole life is characterized by that kind of behavior, hath
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.360]   no inheritance in the kingdom of God.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.440]   Now it means that for this reason.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:42.660]   It cannot mean that any man who falls into any one of these sins is eternally excluded
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.840]   from the kingdom of God.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.240]   It doesn't mean that, thank God.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:55.820]   But it does mean that if this is the characteristic of a man's life, if that is his way of living,
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:01.140]   if that is his walk, if that is his atmosphere, if that is the realm in which he is happy
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:10.420]   and enjoys himself and gets what he seeks for, well then he has no inheritance at all
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.840]   in the kingdom of God and of Christ.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.600]   I say, thank God, that that is the position we've got illustrations in the New Testament
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.900]   itself of Christian people temporarily falling into sin.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.340]   But that doesn't become their habitat, as it were.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.780]   They don't go back and live there and dwell there.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.280]   They don't continue in that.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.460]   I say this because the truth compels me to say it.
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.840]   I know that there are people who at once will clutch onto that, perhaps, and use it and
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.600]   rest it, as Peter says, to their own destruction.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.120]   Well, let me try and make the distinction clear to them.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:50.200]   A persistence in that, a continuance in that, a settling down in that, a reversion to that
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.520]   means that you're not inside the kingdom.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:58.820]   That's the statement, as it is the explanation of all these other statements.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:06.360]   Men and women whose whole demeanor, whose life is characterized by these things, are
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.680]   not in the kingdom of God.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.760]   They have no inheritance there at all.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.480]   Now, why is this true, and why is this true of necessity?
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.960]   Why does the apostle say this he'd know?
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.320]   This is rarely so perfectly plain.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.600]   Well, here he uses a very interesting expression.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:29.080]   He says there's no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.120]   You will find that the learned commentators spend most of their time in dealing with this
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:38.680]   verse on that particular phrase, and what they're concerned about is this.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.640]   They say that what the apostle actually wrote was, "Hath no inheritance in the kingdom
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:49.360]   of Christ and God," from which many of them deduce, and probably rightly, that one of
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.720]   the things the apostle had in his mind here was to say that Christ is God.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.040]   The kingdom of Christ and God.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:02.200]   Not the kingdom of Christ and of God, but the kingdom of Christ and God, of the Christ
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.960]   who is God.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:11.200]   And as I say, that is a perfectly legitimate thing to say.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:16.120]   And yet I somehow cannot but feel that the apostle wasn't primarily concerned to say
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.400]   that, though that is true, and he says similar things elsewhere.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.640]   The Lord Jesus Christ is God, he is God the second person.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:33.120]   But I rather feel that the apostle was here saying, "The kingdom of Christ and of God,"
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.400]   in order that he may emphasize this.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.720]   That this kingdom which Christ has opened to us and for us, and which therefore can
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:49.320]   be rightly called the kingdom of Christ, is also the kingdom of God.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:57.460]   And because it is the kingdom of God, we say this, "God is light, and in him is no darkness
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.600]   at all."
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.440]   And that is the kingdom about which we are speaking.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.440]   The kingdom in which God is the center and the soul, in which God is everything, and
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:14.680]   everything in it must be like God, and God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.720]   You see, we are without any excuse, aren't we?
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.040]   And we find in reading those psalms that we read at the beginning, that it was known to
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.640]   the Old Testament saints, "Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle?
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.080]   Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.640]   He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart, and biteth
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:41.320]   not with his tongue," etc., he is the man who is going to be there, and then again in
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:52.160]   the twenty-fourth psalm, "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, or who shall stand
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.200]   in his holy place?"
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:00.760]   That was the thing that was concerning these men, and he answers, "He that hath clean hands
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:09.080]   and a pure heart, who hath not lifted up his soul into vanity, nor sworn deceitfully, he
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:14.760]   shall receive the blessing from the Lord."
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.680]   My dear friends, what's it matter whether we are happy or miserable, in a sense?
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.660]   What does anything matter but this?
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.760]   Do we want to stand in the presence of the Lord?
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.480]   Do we want to ascend that holy hill?
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.940]   Do we want an entrance into that holy, eternal city of God?
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.840]   Do we want to spend our eternity?
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.080]   That's the question.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.760]   And the first consideration, therefore, is this holiness.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.960]   "Be ye holy," says God, "for I am holy."
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.400]   The thing is so obvious, "This you know."
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:53.800]   Our God is a consuming fire, "God is light, and in him dwelleth no darkness at all."
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.440]   These are the phrases.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:05.360]   And then you look at our Lord himself, and you see that he was holy, harmless, and undefiled,
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.760]   and separate from sinners.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.720]   He was such that he could challenge his accusers at the end and say, "Who can bring a charge
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.040]   against me?"
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:19.120]   He says, "That evil one cometh and findeth nothing in me."
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:26.880]   He stands out in his holiness, in his sanctity, in his eternal purity.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.200]   But here there arises a very subtle danger, and I have no doubt the apostle was dealing
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.840]   with this when he wrote the very words we are considering, and it is a very subtle danger
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.840]   today.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.400]   There are people who argue like this.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:46.080]   They say, "But wait a minute, aren't you this morning preaching the law to us?
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.640]   And you are to be a minister of grace.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.520]   Are you not just preaching pure law?
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.560]   You are reminding us of the being and the character of God, and God has expressed it
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.600]   in the Ten Commandments and in his moral law.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.240]   Are you not just putting us back under the law, and you are excluding every one of us
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.640]   from the kingdom of God?"
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.840]   You see, surely you are forgetting the gospel.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:15.680]   And you see, what they mean by that is this, and this is often how it is put.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:22.880]   They say, "Yes, that was the original kingdom and the original law that God held before
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   mankind.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:32.080]   But now, the Lord Jesus Christ has come, and we are confronted by something quite new.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.040]   We are no longer confronting the law.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.380]   All we are asked to do as Christians is to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.080]   The law made it impossible.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.120]   There was none righteous, no, not one.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.600]   God now has brought in another way, which makes it easier for us.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:53.120]   All we are asked to do is to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and we shall be saved.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.520]   We are no longer confronted by the demands of the law and this tremendous holiness.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.120]   It is just this one question of believing in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:11.460]   Now, that is the most subtle, dangerous heresy that can ever be offered to men and women.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:17.080]   And yet, it characterizes a great deal of modern evangelism.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.760]   How then do we answer this question?
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:26.800]   Well, the answer is perfectly clear in the New Testament itself.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:33.680]   Christ is God, and he did not come into this world to change God's law.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.240]   He says specifically himself in the Sermon on the Mount that not one jot nor tittle
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:44.880]   of the law shall pass away until all be fulfilled.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:50.320]   He has not come to destroy the law nor the prophets, but to fulfill.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:57.480]   And as the Apostle reminds us here, the kingdom of Christ is also the kingdom of God.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.600]   It is the one kingdom.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.240]   The saints of the Old Testament are in the same kingdom as we are.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.780]   They were in it before us.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.120]   We as Gentiles have been brought in.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:12.160]   We were strangers to the covenants of promise and outside all these things.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.680]   But we have been brought in, we have been fellow heirs with them.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.120]   This division as between the old and the new, and to try to argue that the law has got nothing
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.040]   to do with us, is the devil appearing as an angel of light.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.560]   It is the same eternal standard.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:34.000]   In the kingdom of Christ, we are brought face to face with God.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.840]   And what is the work of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.520]   Why did he come?
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.000]   He came to bring us to God, says the Apostle Peter.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.720]   He came, says Paul, and gave himself for us, that he might separate unto himself a peculiar
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.280]   people zealous of good works.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.720]   He came to make us holy, or take the perfect statement of it in the eighth chapter of the
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.280]   epistle to the Romans, verses three and four.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:05.040]   What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:11.440]   Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.440]   Why?
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:18.720]   That in order that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.040]   after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:27.800]   It is the kingdom of Christ and of God, and the standard is not lower in the kingdom of
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.320]   Christ than it is in the kingdom of God.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:39.160]   The kingdom is one, and holiness is still the one and only standard.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:46.600]   So this, I say, is something that is therefore true of necessity.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:51.240]   The Lord Jesus Christ did not come into this world, I say, to lower the standard, or to
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.160]   make it easier, as it were, for us to slip into the kingdom than it was before.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:01.080]   That I can go in now in my sins, but saying, I believe in Christ, no, no.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.020]   Not every one that saith, Lord, Lord, but he that doeth.
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:10.680]   Remember that goes on to the parable, the picture of the house built on the rock and
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.560]   the house built upon the sand.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:17.040]   He introduces it, you remember, in these words.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.720]   He says, "The man that heareth my commandments and doeth them is like unto a man that built
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:26.920]   his house upon the rock; the man that heard his commandments and did not do them is the
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.640]   man who built his house upon the sand."
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.640]   Very well.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.600]   That leaves us with a final question, which is this.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:41.440]   Someone may say, "Well, now then, I cannot reconcile these things in my mind as principles.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:46.000]   I do not understand what you are saying theologically."
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.640]   This is the difficulty.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.240]   People have often felt this difficulty.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:54.960]   They say, "But surely, as you are putting it this morning, you really are teaching justification
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.200]   by works again.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.200]   Are you not saying that it is our life that admits us into that kingdom?
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.720]   Are you not saying that if a man is guilty of these things, he is outside?
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.560]   If he is not guilty, he is inside?
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.300]   Isn't that just going right back to justification by works?
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.180]   Are you not saying, in effect, that a man is justified by his sanctification?
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.640]   That if he is a sanctified man, he is justified.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.980]   But if he is not sanctified, he is not justified, and he is outside."
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.960]   Now people are often in trouble about this.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.240]   They are in trouble in exactly the same way about the sixth chapter of the epistle to
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.240]   the Hebrews.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:33.000]   Now, they say, "Look at those terrible warnings there.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.560]   There we are told that if this man who believes, if he goes back, that he is outside."
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:46.040]   They say, "We cannot reconcile this justification by faith only and this pure grace of yours
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.200]   with this other emphasis, which seems to put it all back upon us and upon our conduct and
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.200]   upon our behavior."
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.040]   Now then, how do we reconcile these things?
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:00.000]   It is a very important question.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   We do so by asserting again that God justifies the ungodly.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.440]   God does not justify the godly; he justifies the ungodly.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.120]   Justification is by faith alone.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:19.360]   It was while we were yet enemies that we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.960]   It was while we were ungodly that we were sinners.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.520]   There is no question about that.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.920]   That is the cardinal doctrine; it is the first great principle.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:42.280]   But justification is only one step, and an initial step only, in a process.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:50.520]   And the process includes not only justification, but regeneration and sanctification and ultimate
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:55.320]   glorification.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:02.120]   Justification and forgiveness of sins are not ends in and of themselves, but they are
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:08.200]   only steps on a way that leads to final perfection.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.740]   Now that is the whole answer to the problem.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.880]   We will persist in isolating these things; they are not isolated in the Scriptures.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.840]   "Whom he hath called, them hath he also justified; and whom he hath justified, them
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.800]   hath he also glorified.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.640]   But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.800]   and sanctification and redemption."
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.640]   There is the whole process.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.640]   And the point is that if you are in it at all, you are in it all.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:43.600]   Now then, we cannot divorce justification and forgiveness, I say, from the remainder.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.720]   And the remaining steps were put very clearly before us.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:54.360]   In 1 Corinthians 6 verse 11, "Such," says the apostle, having given his terrible list
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:36:06.000]   of sins, "such were some of you; but ye are washed, ye have been washed, but ye are sanctified,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.640]   ye have been set apart; God hath moved you from that; he hath put you into his own kingdom;
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:15.280]   he hath separated you as a people for himself; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:21.280]   but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.280]   What does it mean?
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:27.560]   It means this, that God does not just justify a man and leave him there.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.560]   No, no.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:34.680]   If God justifies a man, God has brought that man into the process.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.080]   If you can say that you are justified, I say about you that you have been washed, that
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.360]   you have been sanctified, you have been taken out, you have been removed, you have been
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:47.880]   put into a new realm and into a new kingdom, you are in this process of God that is leading
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:52.720]   to your ultimate, entire perfection.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:37:00.220]   So you see, the verse that we are looking at this morning rarely is saying this.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:05.960]   If there is no evidence in our lives of this process into which God puts the people whom
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:13.460]   he justifies, well then, all I can say is that we have not been justified.
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:18.060]   We are just saying, "Lord, Lord," but he will say to us, "I never knew you.
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.200]   Depart from me ye that work iniquity."
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:28.120]   For the argument is that when God justifies a man, he does bring him into this process
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.880]   and these things happen to him.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.600]   So the way to approach a verse like this, or the early part of the sixth chapter of
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.060]   the epistle to the Hebrews, I will put in this form.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:46.060]   These verses are put before us in order that we may test ourselves by them, in order that
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:50.280]   we may apply the test of their statements.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:56.080]   We are so ready to say, "Lord, Lord, yes, but listen," says Paul, "know this, that
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:02.280]   no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man who is an idolater, hath any part or portion
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.280]   in the kingdom of God."
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:12.320]   It is a terrible thing, you know, but there have been people in the church who have said,
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.800]   "Lord, Lord," but were guilty of these things.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.960]   Read chapter 5 of 1 Corinthians, and there you will find that there was a man, a member
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:24.240]   in the church at Corinth, who was guilty of such a terrible sin that it is not even mentioned
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:31.920]   he says amongst the Gentiles, some of these indescribable foul sins.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.440]   Here was a man saying, "Lord, Lord," and yet guilty of that at the same time.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.360]   "No, no," says Paul, "no, no," says the New Testament everywhere.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.040]   This is not a matter of words.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.800]   Any man can say, "Lord, Lord."
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.840]   If he thinks it will get him to heaven, he will say so.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.680]   Yes, but if he still goes on with his sin, there is no value in it.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.800]   He is not a justified man.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:58.480]   The man who is justified is a man to whom the process has been applied; he is in it.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.280]   And his whole relationship to sin and evil is a new one.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:08.520]   He has been washed, he has been sanctified, he has been justified in the name of the Lord
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.640]   Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.600]   But it is more than a test, and I end with this.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:21.120]   Did you realize that these kinds of verses are a very part of God's way of sanctifying
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.120]   us?
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.720]   Do you remember his last prayer?
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:30.200]   He said, "Lord, God, sanctify them through thy truth.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.360]   Thy word is truth."
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:37.120]   He had already said to certain people, "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:43.960]   indeed, and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.120]   Did you realize that it is through these words that God sanctifies us?
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.440]   It is a part of his method of sanctification.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:56.560]   These great warnings, these threatening, these alarming statements, these are the things
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.960]   that God uses to sanctify us.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.440]   He applies them to us by the Spirit, you see, in this way.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:07.920]   Now we can all test ourselves at this moment whether we are Christians or not.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.680]   How do you react to my text this morning?
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.120]   Does it concern you?
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.880]   Does it alarm you?
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.440]   Does it make you feel ashamed of yourself and your life?
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.880]   Do you say, "It is absolutely right, and I am never in danger of relapsing into antinomianism"?
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.440]   If so, I tell you, you are in the kingdom.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:33.600]   God has used this verse through the Holy Spirit in order to promote your sanctification.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.020]   These words come to awaken the true believer.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.440]   They do not touch the others.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.960]   The others are just made to feel uncomfortable.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.360]   They say, "That is all wrong.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.200]   I thought I was justified by faith only," and they put it in such a way as to make you
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.400]   see at once that what they really mean is this.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.640]   I thought that the gospel said that it did not matter if I went on sinning, that I was
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.800]   all right if I believed in Christ.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.360]   They make the blood of Christ cloak to cover their sins.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.240]   They make merchandise of the cross.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.020]   They are balancing, putting themselves right.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:06.600]   But the man who is rarely called the man who is in the kingdom, he says, "This is right.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.200]   It must be right.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:13.160]   God is holy, God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:21.040]   These very words are used and employed to further and to deepen and to expedite his
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.800]   sanctification.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:29.920]   In other words, I can put it in those great words of the Apostle John in, again, his first
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:42.480]   epistle, third chapter, third verse, "Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.960]   even as he is pure."
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.500]   Of course, a man may say glibly, "Yes, I want to go to heaven.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.800]   I have got this hope in me."
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.200]   "You haven't," says John.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.480]   "Here is the test.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:57.280]   If you have really got this hope in you, if you are really looking to entering that holy
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:05.120]   city at the end and to spend your eternity in it, every man that really has this hope
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:09.520]   in him purifieth himself."
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.520]   Of course, he does.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:16.880]   He is bound to, even as he is pure.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:22.560]   But the man who has only got the hope on his lips and not in his heart, he doesn't purify
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.560]   himself.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:29.240]   He goes on living the old life, and the truth about him is, of course, that he has no inheritance
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:32.120]   at all in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.320]   He doesn't belong to it.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:39.240]   He says, "Lord, Lord," but speech is cheap and easy.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.400]   The question is, is there hope in our hearts?
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.840]   If it is, we recognize the truth.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:53.280]   We say, "Yes, we do know this," that people who live like that obviously cannot have and
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:58.800]   have not any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:05.040]   There is no contradiction between these statements and the doctrine of free grace and justification
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.400]   by faith only.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:13.560]   They establish it, for the God who justifies goes on with the process.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:21.360]   And unless we are giving evidence of being in the process and of being perfected by it,
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:28.000]   there is but one conclusion to draw.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.080]   We have never been in the kingdom at all.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:33.480]   We must go back to the very beginning.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.280]   We must do the first works.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:45.040]   We must repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.960]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
