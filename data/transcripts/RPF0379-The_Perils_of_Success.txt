[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.740]   Today on Radical Personal Finance we're going to talk about the perils of success.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.580]   Life is filled with peril and we all know that failure has a whole bunch of perils.
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.300]   But did you know that success has its own set of perils?
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.220]   I'm sure there are many but today I'm going to share with you a few and specifically I'm
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.340]   going to share with you how they've affected me, the lessons that I've learned from them
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.460]   and I hope this content, because it's related to me, will be helpful and relatable for you
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:21.420]   so that you can avoid some of the problems and the mistakes that I've made.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.060]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.740]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.620]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.460]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.260]   Today we're going to focus largely on that insight and encouragement part of the little
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.260]   slogan.
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.420]   Give you a little bit of insight into success and encouragement of what you can do when
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.220]   you face it.
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.380]   Many people are quick to talk about the problems of failure.
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.700]   Failure has its own set of problems.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.100]   Many people are quick to talk about success but oftentimes we miss some of the benefits
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.220]   and some of the things of success, some of the aspects of success.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.260]   We don't talk, most people who are successful don't spend much time seemingly talking about
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.740]   the problems of success or the things that can happen.
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.620]   Success in the same way that failure is rarely permanent, success is rarely permanent and
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.060]   success has its own attributes.
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.780]   And today I want to talk about some of those with you.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.580]   This show is intended to be probably two things.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.460]   Number one, I want to share with you some of these specific perils.
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.300]   I'll summarize them here in the beginning of the show for you.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.180]   And then I also want to share a little bit about how they've emerged in my own life.
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.540]   And so that part of the show, most of the back half will be largely narrative and be
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.540]   very personal.
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.020]   I won't be digging into any nuts and bolts of personal finance today, any details on
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.140]   an investing.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.420]   So feel free to check back another day if that's the type of content that you're into.
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.940]   And do note that I'm intentionally going to be pretty personal today just because I desire
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.540]   to do this in a way that is relatable and also to share some things from my own experience.
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.060]   One thing that's important to me, if you're a new listener to the show, I want you to
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.220]   know this, one thing that's important to me is to maintain a level of transparency and
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.820]   relatability through my podcast that perhaps is missing in other more professionalized
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.700]   media.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.300]   If you are new to the show, one thing I hope that you'll experience around here is that
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.060]   I try to be very transparent with what I think and why I think it.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.780]   I try to be very transparent with who I am.
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.540]   I just returned from FinCon 16 out in California and my hope is that all of you who are listeners
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.060]   of the show, I met many of you out there, but my hope is that all of you who are listeners
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.980]   of the show found me to be the same person in person that I am on the show.
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.980]   I try to be a consistent person.
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.300]   And I think the podcasting lends well to that because we don't have to reach a mass media.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.900]   I don't have to have a general appeal.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.420]   I'm able to be more me, which is a major component of the second half of this show.
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.900]   But I also want it to be relatable because I think sometimes we can learn from people
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.460]   best who are just a little bit ahead of us.
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.940]   It's great to listen to an expert on whatever thing.
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.060]   If we're going to talk about Tony Robbins, he's got a lot of great stuff to teach you.
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.180]   But at the end of the day, is he really the best teacher for you?
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.620]   Or is somebody who's just a little bit ahead of you or somebody who's beside you possibly
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.200]   do they have something to share?
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.740]   That's why on the show I try to bring experts on the show.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.300]   But I also try to bring just normal people.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.340]   I often invite listeners on the show, very common, ordinary people.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.300]   And I hope that you hear that in the content.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.060]   The metaphor I use for this is that the best person to teach first grade is not necessarily
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.660]   a first grade teacher who's been through a college degree and a master's degree, an undergraduate
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.420]   and a master's degree.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.540]   Sometimes the best person to teach first grade is a second grader who has successfully passed
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.420]   first grade.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.740]   Sometimes for a first grader, the second grader is more relatable.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.740]   Now, I don't think you can take it to either extreme.
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.180]   I don't think that you can say that the second grader is always better.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.820]   We need the teacher sometimes to know where we're going.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.880]   We need somebody to lay out first grade.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.860]   We need somebody to decide what the curriculum is that we actually need to cover.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.080]   What are the concepts that need to be studied in first grade?
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.780]   That's where the teacher steps in.
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.020]   But on the flip side, sometimes the teacher is hard to relate to.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.820]   That's why we want to have a mixture of experts and common people.
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.780]   So I'll be talking about the perils of success, listing them out for you, but then just sharing
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.180]   my story in hopes that it's relatable to you, especially for those of you who are longtime
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.820]   listeners and who've listened from the beginning.
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:01.300]   When I was younger, I used to think that if I just did something or if I just got something
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.620]   better, then everything would be great.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.740]   If only this, if only that, then everything would be great.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.260]   If only I had a better job, if only I were married, if only I lived in a house, if only
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.940]   I didn't live in a house, if only I ran my own business, if only I didn't run my own
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.740]   business, then everything would be perfect.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.100]   Everything would be great.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.260]   That was a pretty immature philosophy that I held for many years of my life and I'm sure
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.940]   that many of you listening can relate.
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:36.340]   I've since discarded that philosophy, both from advancing a little bit in years, gaining
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.660]   in maturity and experience.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.500]   I've had enough personal experience to recognize that that philosophy or that idea is inaccurate
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.300]   and also from study and observation.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:53.740]   I try to talk to old people as much as I can and ask them questions like this.
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.780]   Does everything get better at some point in time?
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.060]   One of the things I've learned from both personal experience and from study and observation
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.620]   is that your problems will never go away.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:12.780]   They will only change in type and character and possibly quantity.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.540]   No matter what, you're going to face problems.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.820]   Now some problems are easier than other problems.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.500]   Some problems are simpler than other problems.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:30.940]   Some problems have a broader impact in your life than other problems.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.220]   Many of you listening right now are facing significant financial problems.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.760]   I've heard it said that if you have a problem that can be solved with money, you don't really
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.020]   have a problem and I think that I agree with the sentiment of that.
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.020]   It really is true.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.340]   If you have a problem that can be solved with money, it's a pretty solvable problem.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.860]   It doesn't mean it's not a problem.
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:58.380]   It just means that in comparison to many of the other problems of life, it's a little
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.940]   simpler to handle.
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.580]   Now that doesn't diminish the impact of that problem and the financial problem in the life
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.700]   of somebody who's going through it.
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.860]   I've walked that road with many people.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.180]   It's very difficult when you're facing significant financial problems.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:19.300]   But don't expect that your problems will ever go away because they won't.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.900]   They'll just change.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.900]   They might be bigger.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.340]   They might be smaller.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.180]   They'll certainly be different.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:38.680]   And don't think that once you are successful, you won't have to face problems.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:46.500]   Don't think that once you are successful, you won't have to face the fear and the pain
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:55.280]   of failure because you will again and again.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:02.380]   This is perhaps the biggest problem or peril of success is we launch out into the deep
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:08.860]   oftentimes in an adventure, whether it's an entrepreneurial venture into a relationship,
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.900]   into something new.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.700]   And we think that this is just going to work out, but we know it might not.
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:22.020]   So we conquer the fear, we conquer the unknown, and we decide to screw up our courage and
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.460]   act in the face of it.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.580]   And then we launch out and we start to experience success.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.420]   And one of the great problems that can occur at this point in time is we might think that
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.700]   now that we are successful, we'll be able to avoid the pain and the insecurity and the
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:43.220]   fear of potential failure.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.820]   And I'm here to tell you, you can't.
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.820]   I can't.
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.620]   None of us can.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:57.660]   One of the most important character traits that we can cultivate for success is some
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:07.740]   level of comfort with fear and uncertainty and with the pain of failure.
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:14.460]   If we can conquer this and become comfortable with the uncertainty and the fear and the
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.540]   potential pain of failure, we can continue doing those things that push us out of our
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:28.220]   comfort zone and those things will lead to ever increasing amounts of success.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.020]   Now the number of perils of success, here's my list that I'm going to be going over and
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.860]   relating to my own story and to my own business, partly as catharsis for some communication
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.420]   between me and you, but also for instruction.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.820]   My story should be pretty relatable.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.140]   I'm a pretty normal guy.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.140]   But here are some of the perils.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.980]   Number one, you may stop doing what made you successful in the first place.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:58.620]   I'm guilty of that and I've seen so many people be guilty of this in different contexts.
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:10.180]   Number two, once you are successful, you may fear losing that success.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.480]   That one has tremendous impact.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:19.300]   Number three, once you are successful, you will constantly compare yourself to other
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:30.140]   successful people and to their success and then yours will pale in comparison.
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:36.340]   Number four, as you become successful, it's easy to lose sight of what you are working
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.500]   toward and why you are working toward it.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:50.180]   It's easy to lose sight of what your goals are and it's easy to compare yourself with
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:58.540]   others based upon their objectives rather than your own.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:05.540]   Now I recommend to you, as I recommend to myself, don't do this.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.260]   It's not a good plan.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:14.540]   So here's a little bit of my story and how these things have affected me.
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.120]   In July, I celebrated the two-year anniversary of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.340]   So about 26 months now of doing the show.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.260]   And the last about a year has been really, really hard.
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:31.740]   I've really struggled, really, really struggled in a number of different ways.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.900]   Not in the same struggles of the first year of the show, not in the same struggles of
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:41.740]   things that I've struggled with in the past in my life, but it's been really, really challenging.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.780]   It's been really, really tough.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.940]   And even though in many ways I've experienced more and more success, the problems and the
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.060]   struggles have continued to mount up.
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:55.980]   Now to be clear, this is not a pity party and I'm not asking you for your sympathy.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.300]   There's nothing wrong with struggle.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.580]   We all struggle with different things.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.160]   I have strengths, I have weaknesses just as we all do.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.780]   And again, as I said earlier, I've learned to embrace the struggle.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.180]   If only, then I'll be successful.
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.180]   That doesn't work.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.100]   There's always going to be struggle.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:18.140]   And struggle is to be embraced and to be appreciated because struggle and challenge often leads
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.500]   to growth.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:26.440]   In hindsight, when we go through difficult times, in hindsight, we'll often look back
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:32.500]   and embrace the challenge, embrace the difficulty.
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.460]   That difficulty and struggle is valuable for many reasons.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.420]   Just some examples from my own life.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:43.180]   When my wife and I were first becoming acquainted and becoming interested in one another, our
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.620]   relationship was not easy.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.380]   We faced a lot of challenges.
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:54.580]   Now the challenges were primarily my fault due to some mistakes that I made in our relationship.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.260]   But it was really difficult.
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.200]   We had some really difficult times.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.520]   And I never understood why it would be that way because I'm Mr. Learner, I'm Mr. Studier.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.200]   I always try to study an issue and try to figure out the right way to do something.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.640]   And so therefore, I usually expect because I know the right way to do something that
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.960]   it's going to work out.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   But it didn't.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.960]   It wasn't easy.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.160]   We had a difficult time.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:24.440]   And yet I look back on that in hindsight and I'm extremely grateful for that struggle because
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:30.240]   it has given me a tremendous level of empathy that I wouldn't have had without it.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.300]   It's very easy if you are used to doing your homework and just think that you can
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.480]   figure out the right way to do something.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.800]   It's very easy to somehow think that, "Well, you just do A, B, C, D and everything will
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.240]   work out."
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.260]   And I think I would have been more susceptible to that if our relationship had just simply
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.960]   been perfect and easy and simple and without complications.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:58.000]   I would have been prone to pride and to feeling confident that my formula was perfect.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.800]   But thankfully, I experienced some struggle and now I'm much more able to be empathetic
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.920]   with those who are having a difficult time in their relationships, with those who've
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:11.320]   gone through difficult experiences and who faced the painful breakup of a relationship
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:18.440]   or the divorce in a marriage or just difficulty relating with somebody that they love.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:24.320]   With regard to finances, I have over the years had on more than one occasion had very difficult
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.680]   times in my own personal finances and I didn't understand why that was the case.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.440]   Now I can see now the mistakes that I made and I know why it was the case, but at the
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.580]   time I thought, "But I'm doing everything right.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:36.580]   Everything should work out.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.760]   I'm doing everything the way it's supposed to be."
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.680]   But in hindsight now, I can not only identify the mistakes, I'm not saying that you have
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:48.160]   to struggle intentionally, you can see those mistakes and in the abundance of counsel you
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.520]   can find wisdom.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:55.600]   But in hindsight, I'm really thankful for those financial challenges.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.080]   I'm really thankful for those mistakes.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:03.800]   I'm thankful for those struggles because again, it's taught me empathy.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:10.240]   And now I'm able to be empathetic with somebody who is struggling and not sit there and judge
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.880]   them that you just don't know what's going on.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.720]   You should just, "Didn't you know?
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.960]   Didn't you read the book?"
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.560]   So embrace the struggle.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.360]   So as again, as I share this, I'm not asking for a pity party nor am I necessarily upset
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.360]   about it.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.240]   I'm just sharing some of the things that I've learned in hopes that it'll be relatable for
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.240]   you.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.080]   But one of the biggest challenges that I faced in the last year has been figuring out how
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:41.220]   to grow the business behind the show.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.720]   As I was at FinCon this last week talking with a number of other people and they all
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.720]   said, "How's it going?"
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.000]   Which is my common answer to all of them.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.040]   I said, "The show's going great."
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.680]   But I'm just struggling with the business.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.440]   The show has grown really well.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:01.320]   The business has been anemic, functional but anemic.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.360]   Here's some updates for those of you who appreciate knowing such things.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:10.320]   I mean, at this point, Radical Personal Finance is in the top 4% of all podcasts in terms
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.400]   of listener size.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.640]   Going up on 4 million total lifetime downloads, the show is I would say somewhere between
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:25.520]   about 13,000 to 15,000 of you who tune in for every new episode.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.800]   Consistently 13, sometimes there are bigger spikes.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.480]   Many of you just download here and there.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.520]   But that's a pretty substantial audience when it comes to podcasts.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.160]   It's in the top 4% of all podcasts.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.880]   The show is routinely ranked in the top 50 for all podcasts in the business category
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.880]   of iTunes.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:49.120]   To the best of my knowledge, I've never broken into the top 200 of all podcasts but routinely
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.440]   the show comes in at the top 50 in iTunes rankings for the business category which is
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.440]   pretty substantial.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:03.120]   It's not unusual that the show can be ranked ahead of many big names in those rankings.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.320]   Those rankings are not perfect.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.680]   They're not infallible.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.800]   They're useful to some degree.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.800]   But the show has done well.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.200]   And yet the business has been really, really challenging.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.080]   It's been hard to know what's the right move.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.360]   I've gone back and forth with different business models.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:22.160]   You'll notice that sometimes I do advertising, sometimes I don't do advertising.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.480]   One thing I've really struggled with is it's been so challenging is actually producing
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.880]   what I've said I'll produce.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.200]   I hate to break my word.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.960]   I hate it.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:36.760]   That's why usually I'm pretty slow to advertise what the next show is going to be.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.200]   I have a calendar myself.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.840]   I have a schedule.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.120]   I know what the shows are, topics that I'm going to do but it seems like every time I
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.160]   say well here this week, this is what we're going to do, all of a sudden the very next
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.680]   day my life gets turned upside down and I can't get that show done.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.960]   For a year and a half I've been talking about getting the book done.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.040]   I have the outline done but I haven't gotten it written.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.640]   I haven't built the courses that I've intended to do.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.720]   And there are reasons behind it.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.920]   One of the biggest challenges with producing the show is I want to do a good job with it.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.440]   So I want the quality to go up.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.560]   Well, that's good.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.480]   It's good to want to do a good job.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:24.320]   But then there's also the pride of wanting to look like I'm doing a good job.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:29.080]   One of the biggest challenges, do I want to do a good job or do I want to look like I'm
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.680]   doing a good job?
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.800]   Now that's – there's a lot of pride in the second one.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.600]   There's an appropriate pride in the first one.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.080]   There's an inappropriate pride in the second one.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:47.800]   And I've been convicted of that and repented and have moved on from that.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.120]   But it's still pretty humbling to recognize that.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.240]   The reality is that I like the attention.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.240]   I like the acclaim.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.440]   I want to experience those things.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.160]   And yet my job is to serve you.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:08.840]   But it's very easy to lose sight of that.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.400]   I've struggled with that, the desire to be popular.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.320]   When I set out to do the show, I discarded popularity as a goal.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:23.400]   I didn't set out to create the most researched business show out there.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.120]   I'm not stupid when it comes to business.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.560]   I know how you can do something like that.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.640]   You can research exactly what's needed.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.520]   I come from – I worked for a couple of years in the market research company.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.360]   Research is tremendously important.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.820]   And if you set out to be popular, you can do that.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.600]   So I could have done that with the show.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.480]   I could have picked the format that would be popular.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.120]   I could have picked the content that would be popular.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.200]   And I see evidence all the time that others are doing that.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:55.360]   So when I set out to do what I do, I decided to do it differently and I discarded popularity
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.640]   as a goal.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.200]   But then along the way, I wound up achieving popularity and a tiny little bit of notoriety
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.200]   within a very small circle.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.040]   And that affects you.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:13.600]   It feels good to be admired.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.400]   Now I do want to be a better broadcaster.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.480]   So I'm proud of the progress that I've made.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.240]   But that has a cost.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.640]   Wanting to be better has slowed me down a ton.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.320]   And again, that first peril is that one of the things that happens is it's easy if
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:33.840]   you experience success to stop doing what made you successful in the first place.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:39.160]   So as that relates to radical personal finance, I've stopped doing the show with the frequency
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.880]   that I once did it.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.860]   I haven't wanted to do that.
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.960]   But when you have a certain standard of production value, when you have a certain standard of
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.160]   the type of content you're trying to convey, when you have a certain standard and you get
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.480]   tired of reading reviews about how you ramble on and on, you spend all kinds of time writing
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:00.160]   your notes so you don't ramble, and you want to keep that high standard, but then all of
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:07.560]   a sudden you start to lose what got you there.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.800]   And by you, of course, I mean me.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.560]   I've started to lose what got me there.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:18.200]   It's more time consuming to do a good show than a bad rambly one.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:25.320]   I've always wanted to be more professional, but that desire to be professional and professional
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.240]   sounding has kept me from tackling some of the content that I probably should have just
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.240]   tackled and not done it fully as professionally.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.920]   I've wanted to be more balanced with the content.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.440]   I think diversity of topics keeps things interesting, so I try to keep things every day where you'll
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.960]   want to come back again and again, but that desire to be balanced has caused me to put
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.920]   things on my content calendar that are very difficult and time consuming, and then I fall
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.920]   behind.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:23:01.280]   So sometimes when you become successful, you stop doing what made you successful.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.440]   Another way this has affected me within my own business project here, Radical Personal
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:12.600]   Finance, I've stopped tackling some of the more difficult, controversial subjects.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.400]   Some of the rawness from the early shows has disappeared, and I've tried to keep that,
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.360]   and I've tried to tackle some of the ... I still try to tackle things that interest me,
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:26.760]   but you get tired of it sometimes.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.720]   And so I know that one of the things that made me successful was fitting the bill of
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:39.400]   Radical Personal Finance, but then oftentimes I shy away from the radical topics.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.800]   So you stop doing what made you successful.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.040]   I've stopped trying new things.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:49.120]   Again, back to that desire to keep things interesting and back to that desire to want
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.960]   to sound good and look good.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.000]   I've stopped trying new things just to see what you all like.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.520]   So one thing I wish I had done better, and I'm going to do better, is in the early days
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.880]   I would sometimes put out a long show, sometimes put out a short show, sometimes tackle a question,
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:10.400]   sometimes do a little mini episode, a little motivational five minutes, things like that.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:17.680]   It's a real danger of success that you stop doing what made you successful in the first
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.680]   place.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.480]   Now, what's remarkable is I haven't only seen this in Radical Personal Finance.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.440]   I used to watch this in my business and other businesses when I was in the life insurance
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.800]   business, and you would see somebody that would do everything that made them successful,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.720]   that's making a certain amount of calls per day or doing this type of sales presentation,
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.000]   and there's a parallel in your business as well.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.080]   But over time it starts to work and then you start to be busy and then you stop.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.320]   Be careful of this one.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:25:00.720]   Because what happens is you can't stop doing what made you successful in the first place
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.080]   or you lose the success.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.760]   Big, big danger.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:18.200]   One challenge of success and other peril is that once you're successful you may fear losing
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   success.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.400]   See, when you're small and you're nobody and you're poor and you're growing, you're willing
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.400]   to try new things.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.340]   You have no brand image to protect you.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.340]   You do what you want.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.400]   You have no reputation to uphold.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.080]   You just do what you feel like.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:39.660]   But when you're successful you start to value that success and it's easy to fear losing
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.840]   that status.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:47.800]   Financially once you've experienced financial success and started to don some of the symbols
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:56.040]   of success, you fear looking like a loser.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.600]   If you've made money and bought an expensive car and then decided that you want to sell
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.560]   the stupid expensive car because you've had a business set back or you've gone into debt
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:13.800]   or you've had a problem or you just need to make a change, it's hard to want to sell the
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.200]   expensive car and drive the beater.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:21.360]   It's a bitter pill for many of us to swallow.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:27.120]   Or you don't want to dump the overwhelming beautiful house, the beautiful house that's
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:32.920]   financially overwhelming and get an apartment.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.920]   You fear losing that status.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.040]   And so you start to change.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.760]   But yet if you would look back and realize, "Wait a second.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:48.040]   What helped me to be successful was my willingness to do these things.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.960]   Why am I so fearful of it?"
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.960]   This happens on radical personal finance.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.760]   Once you're successful, you fear losing the success.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.280]   So I've taken more interviews with ho-hum people on ho-hum topics.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.720]   Now, I try to do some of that because I think experts have something to contribute and I
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:12.840]   think it's dangerous to try to desire to be extreme for the sake of extremism.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.640]   Mainstream is not wrong because it's mainstream.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:24.320]   So I want to take interviews from people who are mainstream.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.800]   But I think I've done too much of that.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.280]   You build a brand at a certain point, okay, radical personal finance, we're going to be
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.560]   radical and then you wind up and say, "Where's the radicalness?"
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.560]   It's nice to be well-connected.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.040]   It's nice to be well-connected in your industry.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:45.080]   It's nice to be connected with famous people and have them sending you books and solicitations
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.080]   all the time.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.400]   It's hard to want to turn those people down.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:55.200]   Once you're successful, you fear losing success because you fear some of the connections that
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.160]   come into play.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.520]   I've feared losing success by not wanting to be abrasive.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.400]   I think here of my interview with Robert Kiyosaki.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.280]   That interview came out about in an interesting way.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.840]   I never reached out to Robert.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.880]   I had a listener of the show that reached out to me and was connected with him and they
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.880]   put us in touch.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.560]   I really like and admire many things about Kiyosaki's message.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:26.120]   I've read many of his books and I have found many of his concepts to be helpful and useful.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:31.400]   Rich Dad Poor Dad is the most influential, biggest selling personal finance book that
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.520]   I'm aware of.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.160]   Tremendously huge brand.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.000]   Tremendously.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.160]   But what's interesting is I'm not a raving fan of his.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.520]   I find a lot of his message very confusing.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.920]   I find a lot of it very wrong, very dangerous, poorly supported.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.200]   So I'm not a raving fan.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.800]   So when I had the opportunity for the interview, I really struggled with how do I do this?
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.480]   I'm not opposed completely, but I'm not a raving fan.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:06.320]   So I tried to do it very fairly and very directly and just give him an opportunity to speak
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.680]   but ask him good questions.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.720]   But after the interview, I thought to myself, "Maybe I should go ahead and do a show with
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.040]   all the things that now that he's had his say, I should all the shows, all the areas
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.640]   where I think he's wrong."
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.840]   And I should have.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.480]   I probably still will.
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.880]   Got an email from a listener a few weeks ago.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.720]   They said, "I'm very confused.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.240]   He says some good things but he doesn't say other good things."
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.640]   But the reason I didn't, it was probably a few things, but one of the reasons I think
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:38.600]   is not wanting to be abrasive, not wanting to attack the big dogs in the industry.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.560]   I'm not a mean person.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.480]   I don't pick personal fights with people.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:49.480]   But I do have things that I think should be criticized about what other people do and
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:55.680]   I probably should take on various financial pundits on different topics.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.760]   But I've held back because you don't want to lose your success by all of a sudden becoming
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.600]   abrasive.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.560]   And this affects you with many people or at least affects me.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.280]   Excuse me, I'm always talking about me.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.040]   Now, at the end of the day, who knows if I'm right or they're right.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.480]   That's where you have to be the judge and time will tell.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:19.200]   I'll tell you this, I'm far less critical of many financial pundits now than I was in
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:24.240]   the past, but that doesn't mean that I should run away from my criticisms.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:30.640]   We should respect the process of debate and criticism and allow it to bring better results
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.240]   on the other side.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.920]   But I never wanted to be an attack dog.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.920]   Some people are like that.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.920]   That's not me.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:46.120]   What's interesting though is I can now relate to what I see happen to politicians frequently.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:50.960]   You find a really good attack dog politician who sticks to their guns and they say, "This
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.740]   is my philosophical ideological position."
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.200]   And because that philosophical or ideological position matches what you believe to be the
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.080]   correct course of action or what you believe to be the right solution, then you start voting
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.080]   for them.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:09.520]   And then they go into office and they come back a different person.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.240]   And you say, "What happened to you?"
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.040]   Well, they got corrupted.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.520]   Not necessarily that they started taking bribes, but it's a very gentle seduction.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:26.040]   It's a very seductive corruption where they don't want to be abrasive.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:30.960]   They don't want to be that guy.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.240]   They want to be liked and included.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   Guess what?
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.240]   I do too.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.520]   It's a real challenge.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:50.680]   And yet what happens is you wind up losing the respect and the benefit that you had with
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:58.320]   those who elected you and you wind up being despised by all sides.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.840]   Part of the danger of success is that once you're successful, you will constantly compare
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.160]   yourself to other people's success.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.240]   This has affected me with business things.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.640]   I think maybe I can do this.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.640]   Maybe I can do that.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.640]   I want to write.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.640]   I want to do video.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.640]   I want better, cooler stuff.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.960]   I want to do it all right now.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.120]   But I can't do it all right now.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.480]   I can't.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.480]   And what happens is I wind up chasing my tail trying to do it all right now.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.880]   And in the process of trying to do it all, I forsake doing the core that got me successful
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.960]   in the first place.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.440]   See the vicious cycle?
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.260]   It's terrible.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.320]   But the same thing may happen to you.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.000]   It might happen in your business.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.360]   You can identify and diagnose those problems.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.760]   But it may happen in your finances.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:50.420]   You reach a certain level of status and you want everyone to think that you're successful.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:55.380]   And so you start comparing yourself to other people's success.
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:59.400]   And yeah, your boss can buy a round of drinks for the whole bar or your boss can buy everyone
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.400]   dinner.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.760]   And so you say, "Well, that must be what I need to do to be able to be successful."
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.920]   And so you think, "I need to do it."
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:12.520]   And you wind up destroying your budget trying to fit in.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.500]   Or you wind up moving to the cool part of town and not saving any money because you're
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.240]   living in the cool part of town because you're trying to compare yourself to other people's
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   success.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.240]   Here's the deal.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:27.180]   You will never be as successful as everyone else is.
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:33.340]   No matter what stage in life you reach, no matter what metric of success, there will
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.240]   always be somebody who's ahead of you.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.040]   There will always be somebody that has more money than you, that has a nicer car, that
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.620]   has a better looking husband or wife.
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.560]   There will always be somebody that's ahead of you.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:53.320]   But even if you are the number one in your field, you're the highest earner in your company.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.780]   That comes with a cost.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:59.400]   And so somebody else will be more beautiful than you are.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.360]   Somebody else, you might be the highest earner, but somebody else is a better investor and
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.400]   so they have more money than you do.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.680]   Or you might have more money, but they have a better marriage than you do.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:15.760]   Or their kids are more athletic and yours is not.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:21.120]   Real danger of success is that you're constantly comparing yourself to other people's success.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:25.780]   But now instead of being at the bottom where success is achievable because you just got
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:35.320]   to move up a little bit, now you are constantly looking to people who are far above you.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.400]   You haven't been down the path they've been.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.760]   You're not at the place where they are.
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.000]   You have to find a metric of success that's meaningful to you.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.080]   We'll come to that in just a moment, but a quick story on this comparison.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:56.800]   I have two podcasts and my podcasts are hosted with a company called Libsyn, which is the
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:01.200]   best podcast hosting company, by the way, free month of posting with the code word radical,
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.160]   coupon code radical.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.720]   If you're thinking about starting a podcast, just tell them radical, you get a free month
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.720]   of hosting.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.760]   So I host with Libsyn and I have two podcasts.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.920]   What's interesting is when you open up your Libsyn account, you see on the front page
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:22.960]   just kind of a summary and there's a summary snapshot of the chart of your show.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:29.920]   So for a podcaster, for a blogger, et cetera, one thing that often is a very seductive trap
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.760]   is where you wind up looking at your statistics.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.520]   You look at the number of people that are listening to your show or that are reading
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:40.520]   your blog or how many are on your email list or whatever.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.200]   These are real metrics, but sometimes they're vanity metrics.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.840]   But the chart is interesting because it doesn't show the, what's it called, the metric, the
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.840]   scale.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.120]   It doesn't show the scale.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:58.400]   And so I open it up and sometimes it's opened up to the radical personal finance chart and
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.740]   sometimes depending on which show I last published from, it's opened up to my other show, Encouraging
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.760]   Christian Fathers.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:11.160]   And all you see is the chart with the ups and downs without the scale.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:17.600]   Now radical personal finance, like I said, probably has, it gets somewhere 13, 15,000
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.120]   downloads a day across all the shows, something like that.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.600]   I can't, I don't check that number.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:27.640]   I just look at the new listens per show after a few weeks.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.120]   But it gets thousands and thousands of downloads per day.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:36.000]   My other show has probably around 800 subscribers, probably about 800 men that subscribe to
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.400]   that show.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:42.080]   And so it's a very, very different scale in terms of audience size, et cetera.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.400]   There's a massive difference there in audience size.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:50.680]   But what's funny is that when you back out and you just see that summary chart on the
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:56.060]   front page, I can't tell the difference.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:01.360]   They have the same look.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.240]   And what's interesting is that over time, for those of you who are beginning podcasters,
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.920]   I encourage podcasters, bloggers, whatever, enjoy the journey.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:16.020]   Because what happens is over time you're going to become a little bit insulated to the numbers
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.000]   and the meaning.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.200]   I'm overwhelmed by the idea of thousands of people.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.920]   I can't conceive of thousands of you listening.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.080]   I can't conceive of it.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.080]   It overwhelms me.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:31.480]   It pops my stack.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.120]   But I can conceive of a few hundred.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:42.080]   And I try to take joy in the movement, the trajectory, the direction.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.920]   You can't take joy in the scale because the scale is meaningless.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.500]   And so applying this to finance, that's what you see.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.520]   If you find that you're earning more than you're making, as the famous Charles Dickens
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:59.680]   quote goes, you'll find a degree of financial freedom.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:05.920]   And you're just as free if you're earning $40,000 and spending $35,000 as you are if
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:10.960]   you're earning $120,000 and spending $105,000.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.560]   The scale, yes, it does matter, but it doesn't matter.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.000]   I know it's a paradox.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.360]   You can live in a house and for me, one of my dreams when I was younger, which I have
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:29.320]   since fulfilled, and I got this from being a financial advisor, I would often go and
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.600]   meet with people and I would sometimes go to their house at 9.30 in the morning.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:37.400]   I'd meet them at their house and I'd be sitting in their house at 9 a.m. or 9.30 in the morning
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.320]   and they'd be sitting at their house drinking coffee at the kitchen table meeting with me.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.460]   And I'd often ask myself, who is the kind of person who can be sitting at their house
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.760]   drinking coffee at 9.30 in the morning meeting with me?
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.960]   And it became a goal of mine to be able to, if I wanted to, sit at my kitchen table and
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.040]   drink coffee at 9.30 in the morning in my house at my kitchen table.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:01.880]   That became a goal of mine and I have since achieved it, which I'm very thankful for.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.840]   And thank you to all of you listening who have enabled me to be able to achieve that
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.840]   goal.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:13.120]   Now, I won't tell you that I'm up at five in the morning working, but at 9.30, I'm sitting
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.000]   at my kitchen table drinking coffee.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.520]   And that to me became a symbol of success.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.080]   But you know what?
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:30.080]   You can wake up and have a 9.30 cup of coffee in your house if that house is very humble
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:35.300]   or if that house is very ostentatious.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:39.160]   At the end of the day, you can only drink from one cup of coffee at a time and you can
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:45.080]   only sit at one table at a time.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:53.880]   And is there a small difference of experience between drinking a cup of coffee at a table
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.320]   in a humble house or a cup of coffee at a large and ostentation house?
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.760]   I bet there probably is.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.160]   I enjoy beautiful views.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.340]   I like to go to nice hotels and sit and look at the water or sit and look at the mountains
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.920]   or sit and look at the valley.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.720]   I think that's nice.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:14.800]   But the vast majority of it can be experienced with a simple act of a cup of coffee and a
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   table.
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:20.200]   I like to go out in the woods, go camping in the woods and wake up early and sit and
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:24.420]   drink a cup of coffee by a campfire.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:30.600]   So the point is don't compare yourself on somebody else's scale.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.800]   Don't compare yourself to somebody else's success.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.840]   My definition of success, one of them, is being able to have the cup of coffee at 9.30
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:45.080]   in the morning at my house at my kitchen table.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:50.840]   Doesn't matter to me about your kitchen table or at least it shouldn't.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.840]   Obviously these things creep in sometimes.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.800]   So it's easy and the final peril is this.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:01.680]   You can lose sight of what you're working towards and what your goals are and you can
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:07.880]   start to compare yourself with others based upon their objectives rather than your own.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.120]   Why are you doing what you're doing?
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.960]   Why do you want to do it?
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.920]   I didn't get into this business because I wanted to have a business like Dave Ramsey.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.920]   I like Dave.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.920]   I admire him.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.280]   He's done a tremendous amount of good.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.040]   He's built a tremendous business.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:28.200]   I went up to Nashville last year and I met Dave and watched him record his show and instantly
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.760]   I was able to put myself there.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.440]   Instantly I was able to say, "Well, I could do that.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.960]   I can have this big building and this fancy production."
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.320]   Dave doesn't have anything that I don't have.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.920]   Yeah, he's got a couple decade head start but no big deal.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.920]   He's not smarter than me.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.920]   He's not better than me.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.080]   He's not more articulate than me.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.520]   He's not a better student than me.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.000]   I have all the basic qualities.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.920]   He's just got a head start.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:57.280]   And so I can instantly put myself there and say, "Well, then I need to be the next Dave
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.280]   Ramsey."
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:04.360]   That's so, so attractive.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:09.680]   That is so seductive.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:15.760]   The question is, do I really believe that that's what I want?
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.120]   Do I really want that?
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:24.080]   Or am I just doing that because that's somebody else's life and that's somebody else's goal?
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:31.360]   See, I didn't get into radical personal finance because I wanted to have a big business like
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.840]   Dave Ramsey.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:42.040]   I had different goals.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.440]   Certainly I want to do well.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.280]   I intend to build tremendous wealth.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.560]   But wealth doesn't control me.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:55.240]   I'm not implying that it controls him either, just using him as an example.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.440]   Wealth doesn't control me.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.760]   The love of money doesn't control me.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.560]   One of the reasons I got into the industry was I was annoyed and angry that there's some
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.800]   voices and perspectives that are not being heard.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:13.000]   There's some viewpoints and philosophies and opinions that are not given a platform.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.480]   I had a vision for the impact that a different message could make.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.680]   Those are the things that compel me.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:27.480]   And yet, when you achieve a little bit of success, you can quickly say, "Well, I want
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.760]   more.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.080]   I want to do what that person has done."
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:40.120]   There's a famous story from Andrew Carnegie.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.700]   Andrew Carnegie was a fascinating guy.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:53.540]   In 1901, he sold Carnegie Steel and went on to form a steel trust called United States
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:54.540]   Steel.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:44:01.700]   He became the richest man in the world when that happened.
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:05.580]   After that happened, he spent the rest of his life giving away most of his money.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.260]   He did a great job.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:10.260]   He made a lot of money and then he gave it away.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:14.180]   After he died, they were searching through his personal effects.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:19.780]   And they found a note that he had written when he was 33 years old and he was making
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.140]   $50,000 a year.
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:29.860]   Now, this was in a different age when the average laborer earned about 500 bucks a year.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.700]   But he wrote this on a note.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:38.260]   He said, "Man must have an idol.
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:44.580]   The amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of idolatry.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:48.940]   No idol more debasing than the worship of money.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.820]   Whatever I engage in, I must push inordinately.
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:59.980]   Therefore, should I be careful to choose that life which will be the most elevating in character.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:05.500]   To continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and with most of my thoughts wholly
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:12.020]   upon the way to make more money in the shortest time must degrade me beyond hope of permanent
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.140]   recovery.
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:20.820]   I will resign business at 35, but during the ensuing two years, I wish to spend the afternoons
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:24.700]   in receiving instruction and in reading systematically."
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:33.940]   Now, he wrote that advice to himself at 33.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:41.860]   And then he spent the rest of his life obsessed with money, making it and then giving it away.
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.060]   Don't make some of these mistakes.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:51.100]   What's interesting is one of the biggest struggles I've had is just simply knowing what to do
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.700]   in my business.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.980]   One thing I loved about the life insurance business is that it was simple.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.820]   If you do this, you get this outcome.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:04.620]   I can tell you all the ratios, make this many phone calls, get this many referrals, go and
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:07.540]   meet with this many people, and you'll have this many sales.
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:09.380]   It's very, very simple.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.260]   And the great thing is you memorize the scripts, you make the calls, you see the people, you
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.220]   fix their problems, and you get these results.
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:20.100]   70% of people in the United States are underinsured when it comes to life insurance.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.100]   And I loved that.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.420]   I could go into the business and I could just follow the plan.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.060]   I also hated the simplicity of that.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.900]   I got really bored, but it was simple.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.420]   You knew what to do.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.980]   If you had a problem, our business was so well researched that if you had a problem
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:38.900]   with your outcome, you could just go back and study the process and we would go through
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:39.900]   the ratios.
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:43.220]   And every Monday morning, we'd have our client, we call it client builder meetings, and we'd
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.220]   go through the ratios.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.740]   And I would coach new guys and all I need is the numeric ratios of their activity and
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.340]   I could diagnose exactly where the problem was.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.820]   Oh, it's a language problem.
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.540]   It's a recommendation problem.
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:55.540]   It's whatever.
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:00.260]   The biggest challenge for me has been, well, in this business, it's hard to know what to
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.260]   do.
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.260]   Do I do more shows or fewer?
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.580]   Do I do longer shows or shorter?
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.260]   Do I do more controversial shows or not?
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.620]   Do I pursue advertisers and make my own products?
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.940]   What advertisers do I accept?
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.180]   What products do I make?
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.860]   Sometimes I feel competent as a broadcaster and incompetent as a businessman.
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.760]   Should I go into radio where some of the business can be taken away from me and I can focus
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:25.100]   on the skill of broadcasting?
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.620]   Success brings with it all kinds of challenges.
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:29.300]   I've struggled with the extra work that comes from success.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:33.820]   For those of you who are new with any type of venture, here's what happens.
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:38.220]   With feedback, you'll get none and then for a long time, then you'll get a little and
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.280]   you'll be excited about it and then you'll get a ton and you'll start to dread your inbox.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:45.580]   Not because you dread the communication, but you dread the inbox.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:48.380]   So these are things that happen.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:54.020]   And at the end of the day, you've got to go back and reassess and reconsider what are
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:58.620]   your objectives and why are they your objectives?
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:03.780]   Because you can't take somebody else's goals on for you.
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:09.660]   Just because somebody else has a goal of being valedictorian in their high school class doesn't
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:13.140]   mean that you should have that same goal.
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:18.100]   If you spend your time pursuing the goal of being a valedictorian, you are going to be
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:22.340]   giving up something else that you could be doing.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.620]   You're perhaps going to be giving up playing sports.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.740]   Perhaps you're going to be giving up starting a business.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:30.180]   Perhaps you're going to be giving up a hobby that you're doing.
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:33.300]   Perhaps you're going to be giving up having a great time traveling with friends and hanging
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:39.820]   out and going spelunking on the weekends.
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:44.700]   So when you set a goal, you figure out what's the goal and what's the cost and am I willing
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:48.460]   to pay the cost.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:49:03.380]   Be careful for these dangers and perils of success because they are seductive and they're
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:06.660]   probably going to happen to you.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.100]   They've certainly happened to me.
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:14.180]   Now I can't just by making you aware of them, I'm hoping that when they do happen to you
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.980]   that you will pay attention to them.
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:22.460]   The dangers of success that I have gone into or that I have faced and the mistakes that
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:25.020]   I have made has not been a surprise.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.020]   These things happen.
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:30.140]   So the good thing about content like this is that you're able to look at it and you're
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:33.660]   able to see it and then hopefully you'll be able to say, "Ah, when that happens, I'm aware
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.700]   of it."
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:44.160]   That's the point of a show like this, to help you to be aware of it so that you'll recognize
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.220]   it when it happens.
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:51.620]   When we're training our children, we teach them to recognize certain things.
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:54.280]   We give them certain instruction.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.680]   When you're crossing the street, here's what you do and we drill it into their head again
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.680]   and again and again.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:04.420]   It's as simple as crossing the street or it's as complex and as important as, "My son, here's
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:07.220]   how you avoid the seductress.
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.320]   Here's what's going to happen.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.620]   You're going to face this in this position.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:13.140]   You do this."
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:18.100]   From the simple to the complex.
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:24.900]   So with regard to these aspects of success, done with preaching about what they are, what
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:30.320]   does that mean with me and with the future of radical personal finance and how will that
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.380]   impact potentially you?
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:38.720]   Well, the last few weeks have been for me very much a time of introspection and just
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:45.020]   considering what I've been doing, what's been working, what hasn't been working.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.980]   And then thankfully, this was – well, I knew it was going to be.
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:54.420]   I was able to finish with a visit to FinCon 16 out in San Diego, California this past
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.140]   week, which is – enjoy FinCon.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:00.260]   It's a network of my compatriots and my peers, a lot of listeners to the show, but also a
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:04.340]   lot of people who do things similar to what I do.
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.460]   In past conferences, I've gone with different agendas.
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:07.460]   This time, I just went to hang out.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:11.540]   I went to hang out with listeners, enjoyed meeting up with many of you, and I went to
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.620]   hang out with other people who were doing similar things to me.
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:19.700]   And it gave me a good opportunity just to think and to get a little bit more clarity
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.580]   on what I'm doing.
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:27.780]   So a couple of things, just for the record, so that I have this here to send people to.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:35.300]   I'm not willing to fall prey to these perils of success.
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:39.980]   I know what they are, but I'm not willing to fall prey to them.
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:44.620]   I'm not going to fear losing success.
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:49.620]   I'm not going to stop doing what made me successful in the first place, and I'm not going to compare
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:54.460]   myself to other people's success, and I'm not going to lose sight of what my goals and
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:59.220]   objectives are and try to all of a sudden start substituting other people's.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:04.060]   And I have done this, but I'm not willing to do it any longer.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:10.180]   So first, you should know that, although to some of you, you might think that I have already
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:14.820]   been unfiltered, going forward on Radical Personal Finance, I am removing the filters
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:19.980]   from the content.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:31.260]   I do not care about political correctness as an end or goal in itself, in any way, shape,
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:33.260]   or form.
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:40.060]   Now that does not mean that I desire to be rude or insulting or demeaning or mean.
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:43.140]   I'm none of those things.
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:49.180]   I think we should treat all people honorably and with respect and with gentleness.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:55.340]   But it does mean that I have no interest in affirmative action.
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:53:01.020]   I'm not going to try to play the game of giving equal airtime to all sides.
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:06.140]   And this has been a tremendous challenge for me because I desire, and a mistake that I've
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:09.180]   made, because I desire to be thoughtful.
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.500]   I desire to be careful.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.820]   I desire to be inclusive.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:16.340]   I desire to be non-discriminatory.
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:20.100]   I desire to be welcoming.
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:23.100]   But that's been very paralyzing for me.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.660]   It's been very difficult for me.
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:28.060]   I've tried to maintain a balance.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:33.460]   I've tried to have something that's been helpful, but this is probably just primarily for me,
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.460]   not for you.
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:39.900]   But for me, that's been very paralyzing because I can't hit that standard.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.500]   I can't have an equal show.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:47.180]   I can't give equal airtime to all people, nor do I want to.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:52.780]   So I don't care about you being a man or a woman.
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:57.380]   I'm not interested in trying to maintain a balance between the number of my guests who
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.620]   are men and the number of guests who are women.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.420]   My show is not targeted at men.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:02.820]   It's not targeted at women.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.820]   And I'm not into that marketing stuff.
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.500]   If you want a show for women, either go find one or go create one.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.300]   If you want a show for men, go find one or go create one.
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:16.940]   But I am not trying to keep some kind of artificial balance where if you are a man, I do a show
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:20.500]   on this day, and if you are a woman, I do a show on this other day.
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.420]   I talk to people because they're interesting to me.
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.620]   And I don't care if you're a man or a woman.
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:30.540]   If you have something that's interesting or something that will help to serve my audience,
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:34.120]   then I care about talking to you.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:38.620]   But I have no interest in playing this game of affirmative action.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:42.260]   Do something that's interesting.
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:45.420]   Teach and help and serve my audience.
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:51.020]   And I don't care who you are.
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:56.940]   I don't care if you're black or if you're white or if you're yellow or if you're red.
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:01.100]   One of the areas that I've shied away from on Radical Personal Finance is I've just been
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:06.940]   scared to tackle racial issues when it comes to money.
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:12.140]   In today's culture, especially in the United States, it's really hard when you're white
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:16.860]   to feel confident enough to take on the difficult questions that emerge based upon the color
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:19.620]   of your skin.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:23.840]   But there are some serious differences in money between people who have differently
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:29.540]   colored skin, and those things need to be discussed.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:33.860]   And perhaps it's taken me two years of work to try to come to the place where I'm confident
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:39.700]   enough to do it, but I'm not going to run away from it.
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:43.020]   I'm tired of it.
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:47.900]   And I'm tired of seeing other people run away from difficult questions simply because you
[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:51.220]   have more or less, what is this stuff, melanin, right?
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.500]   Melanin in your skin.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:59.940]   The color of your skin does not matter in the sense that your ideas have more or less
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:00.940]   value.
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:06.020]   The content of your ideas matters, and we need to talk about difficult topics.
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:10.660]   And I'm not playing the politically correct game anymore.
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:17.580]   I don't care about whether you are a Christian or a Muslim or an atheist.
[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:23.220]   I'm absolutely convinced that you cannot disconnect your worldview from your money.
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:28.740]   You cannot disconnect your religion from your money.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.540]   Religious neutrality is an absolute myth.
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.360]   There is no neutrality.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:38.980]   It's just a matter of which religion is dominant or in control in your life or my life, and
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:45.980]   which religion is dominant or in control in a culture or a society or a country or a community.
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:51.420]   There is no religious neutrality.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.580]   I don't care about your politics.
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.420]   Sorry, this is sounding more...
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:57:00.500]   I guess I'm just, for me, stating some of the things that are a little bit pent up and
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.820]   stating it for the record, so I'm not mad at you, the listener.
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.460]   But I don't care about the politics.
[00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:08.500]   I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican or a Libertarian or a...
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:09.500]   I don't know.
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.500]   I ran out of...
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:15.380]   An anarcho-capitalist or an anarchist or...
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:19.540]   I know all the ones on the right, communist, socialist, whatever.
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:27.140]   If you don't think politics matter to your money, what world are you living in?
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:32.220]   Did you watch the Trump-Clinton debate this week?
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:36.140]   You have two likely candidates for president.
[00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:41.700]   On the one hand, you have a communist, and on the other hand, you have a fascist mercantilist.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:42.700]   You're doomed either way.
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:45.860]   We're all doomed either way.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:50.460]   The point of this is that I cannot maintain a balanced perspective and still produce the
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:54.460]   show, and that's been incredibly stressful to me to try.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:57.140]   So I'm done trying.
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:03.540]   Trying to maintain a balanced perspective or to be politically correct stresses me out,
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:07.540]   and it causes me to second guess everything that I want to do because I'm trying to be
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.940]   politically correct.
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:12.900]   Now, again, I'm not trying to...
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:17.180]   I have no intention of creating offensive content.
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:18.740]   That's not the point.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:25.060]   The point is that political correctness and affirmative action, it's a losing proposition.
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.860]   Let me give you an example.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:31.340]   For a long time, I've wanted to launch a huge series on the show on what the Bible teaches
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:33.180]   about money.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:35.780]   The Bible says more about money than it does about faith.
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:40.060]   It says more about money than it does about love, and it says more about money than it
[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.060]   does about prayer combined.
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:47.280]   The New Testament says more about money than it does about faith, love, prayer, or almost
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:50.940]   any other topic combined.
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:55.740]   Money is a central theme of the Bible, and there's some incredible riches there to learn.
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:59:00.780]   Some of the strongest promises in the Bible are related to money, and some of the direst
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:04.460]   warnings are related to money.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:11.220]   And thus, as somebody who's creating a personal finance show, I should cover that, and I want
[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:12.220]   to cover that.
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:16.020]   I spend a tremendous amount of time studying these issues.
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:19.020]   But I've waited out of not wanting my show to be too Christian, too religious.
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:24.100]   Every time I do a religious show or mention anything Christian, I get emails and reviews,
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:25.460]   and it gets really annoying.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:27.900]   So this is the point of this message is for those of you.
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:33.600]   Now, I'll just send you to this timestamp, and I'll be done with it.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:39.300]   The point is that I've waited because I'm also interested in what the Koran teaches
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:44.580]   about money, and I'm also interested in what the Jews believe about money, and I'm also
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:48.300]   interested if there are any Hindu teachings on money, and I'm also interested in what
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.660]   any atheist teachings on money.
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:54.520]   And I think about those things with as much depth as I have the ability to do.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.900]   And so I'm very interested in those topics, but I've pulled back out of trying to maintain
[00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:58.900]   some kind of balance.
[00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.640]   Meanwhile, I look for an imam or somebody who's willing to come on the show and talk
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.620]   about it, and I can't find anybody good.
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:08.860]   I found one or two that I'm going to work with, but I'm done trying to keep any kind
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:10.940]   of balance.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.700]   Biggest thing for me, I've gotten sucked into the trap of trying to please everyone else,
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:22.900]   and as a predictable result of that, I've pleased very few, including myself.
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:23.900]   So I'm done.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.680]   I love debate.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:32.800]   In a debate, you can find out if what you believe can hold up to the light of day.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:38.880]   You can find out if your ideas are founded on something solid or if they melt away like
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.880]   sand.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.840]   I like to watch debates because debates are a very efficient way of understanding the
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.100]   major issues in a conflict.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:51.200]   When I have a question about something, not a Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump debate, that's
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.280]   a waste of time.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:57.480]   When I have a question about something where there's an actual legitimate topic, I like
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:03.560]   to go and watch a debate on the subject because the debaters are trying to distill the essence
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:08.840]   of a topic into a specific viewpoint, a specific position that will bring in their strongest
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.080]   arguments.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.040]   And so debates are powerful.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.740]   And I like to debate because as a debater, I win either way.
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:23.640]   Either my arguments win and they have hopefully a positive effect or my arguments lose and
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:30.860]   I win by discovering an area of error and correcting it.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:37.180]   And frankly, I'm sick and tired of evil and sin and debauchery and ugliness winning in
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:38.880]   our culture and winning on the airways.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.040]   I'm done with it.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:47.640]   I'm absolutely tired of going to FinCon and it happens at all the conferences, not just
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.720]   FinCon.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:58.800]   But these days you go to a business conference and drunkenness and profanity and lewd content
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:04.640]   are a consistent theme across a majority of the speakers.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.040]   I don't know what it is about somehow the modern business culture, but evidently the
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.080]   number one character aspiration to have and to praise and to celebrate is drunkenness,
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.560]   public drunkenness.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:25.660]   And there's no respect any longer for profanity and for the content of your message.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:26.960]   It's disgusting.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.440]   And here I am sitting back, I sit back and I try to be sensitive and inclusive.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.920]   Why do I sit back and try to be sensitive and inclusive when no one else does?
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.440]   Why do I do that?
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:42.020]   Why is Howard Stern or why do the shock jocks get all the pay?
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:47.360]   Why does Donald Trump and his antics get all the airplay?
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:54.080]   Why do not those of you, why do not you and I step up and not pull back and hold back
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.800]   our ideas?
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.960]   Why do those of us who actually care about our fellow human beings not stand up and actually
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.100]   say something?
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:06.360]   Why do those of us who actually care about the health of an individual, the health of
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:11.240]   a family, the health of a society stand up and condemn drunkenness instead of celebrating
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.240]   it?
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.840]   There is nothing positive about drunkenness, public or private.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.100]   It destroys families' lives.
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:26.720]   Why do you and I sit back and not criticize that?
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.960]   So I'm done.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:38.320]   I'm promoting ideas on this show that I believe in and I'm done with the filter.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.680]   If you desire to debate me, please do so.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:43.140]   I welcome the debate.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:48.880]   But I'm doing you no favors as a listener and I'm doing me no favors as a podcaster,
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.080]   a broadcaster by holding back and trying to be neutral.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.760]   Number one, I start to hate my own show because I try to filter it to please the non-existent
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.280]   you and I wind up frustrating all members of the audience.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.840]   I frustrate the person who thinks that I'm too extreme on this side and I frustrate the
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.800]   other person and says, "Why are you holding back there?"
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:12.440]   And I wind up miserable, which is what has happened basically.
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.520]   So I'm doing you no favors, I'm doing me no favors.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:22.240]   If I'm wrong about something, I desperately want it to be exposed so that I can get right.
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.960]   So you should know that about me as a person.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:30.560]   If you think I'm wrong about something, feel free to, you want to pick a bone to pick with
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.560]   me, do it.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.320]   You're actually welcome to fight with me on my website.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.480]   I approve all the comments personally and I approve the nasty ones and the nice ones.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.440]   I think I've only ever rejected one nasty comment.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:48.600]   I was really tired after a long day working and someone made some stupid, insulting comment
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:53.520]   probably with some asinine ad hominem attack as its center and I just felt like they were
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.480]   walked into my house at the end of a long day and threw a bunch of garbage all over
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.480]   my floor and on that one I just like, "Why?
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.480]   It's my website.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:04.320]   I have no duty or obligation whatsoever to approve your stupid comment."
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.320]   I hit trash.
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:08.640]   Now I know it's my site and I can do whatever I want with it.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.040]   I could clear all that stuff out and nobody would care.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.240]   But anyway, I don't mind it.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:18.400]   I know my ideas are not politically correct, but I don't care about politics.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.760]   I don't want any position of authority or control whatsoever.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:25.080]   I have no interest in that.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:31.400]   I want my ideas to be heard and I want them to be heard by those who have an ear to hear
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.920]   and are interested in those ideas.
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:43.520]   So I'm fixing my own problem with this little discussion here and I know that I didn't have
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.640]   to do this, but to me I always like to communicate up front.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.840]   I always try to do everything in the light.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.620]   I try to communicate clearly.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:52.680]   That way I feel better, at least I've given you a warning, a trigger warning.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:57.080]   Here's your trigger warning.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.420]   And I'm not saying that I'll change anything about my tone.
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:03.540]   Those of you who appreciate the tone that I take, I'm not changing anything.
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:09.480]   As I cover difficult issues, I intend to do so in a respectful and careful and thoughtful
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.200]   way.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:16.640]   If you're interested, the reason I do this is because I do it in this way and I try,
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.640]   hopefully I do it well.
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:22.760]   I try really hard to do it thoughtfully and to be respectful and careful.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:27.800]   But the reason I try to do that is because the Bible commands it.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.920]   The book of first Peter, the apostle Peter says this, he says, "But even if you should
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:36.140]   suffer for righteousness sake, you will be blessed.
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:43.200]   Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy,
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:50.040]   always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for the hope that is in
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.040]   you.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:58.720]   Yet do it with gentleness and respect, having a good conscience so that when you are slandered,
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:02.920]   those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame."
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.160]   So I think that the way we debate ideas is very important.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:10.320]   It should always be done carefully and with gentleness and respect.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:18.280]   But it should also be done in a way that gives full exposure to the ideas at hand.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:26.880]   It should be done in a way that gives full access to an idea so we can consider it.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.080]   Many of you said, "Joshua, why don't you censor somebody out?"
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.320]   Or many of you said, "Joshua, why don't you edit this out?"
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:35.280]   The reason I don't do it is because editing is usually done as a way of manipulating an
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.480]   idea, manipulating a message.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:43.800]   And I'm not talking about editing a technological problem, but when you edit somebody's content,
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.960]   you take out what you pick and choose.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.800]   And I don't think that's fair to people.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:54.640]   I think that we should respect another person and respect their argument and give it the
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:59.840]   full light of day.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:05.480]   I've discovered that I always thought that I was a courageous person, and then I discovered
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:09.000]   that I wasn't quite as courageous as I thought.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.640]   Courage is hard, but I am convinced it's worth it.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:20.400]   It's been fascinating to me to watch the political landscape of the past year or two
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.400]   years.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.400]   I mean, what's it been?
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:24.400]   A year or so, I guess, has been remarkable.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.960]   And from a broadcaster perspective, the broadcaster that I probably most admire in the large mainstream
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.040]   broadcaster space is Glenn Beck.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.880]   I really admire Glenn.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:44.920]   And as I've thought about it, I realized that I know why I admire him, but I find it difficult
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:51.320]   to do the things that he does, which are the reason why I admire him.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.560]   I admire him because he's actually real.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.960]   He actually shares who he is.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.960]   He actually is...
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.600]   I hate the word authentic.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.760]   So overused.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.080]   He actually is transparent.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.720]   He's actually him.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:08.920]   Good, bad, whatever.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.640]   And I love that because I know where he stands.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.840]   I know what he believes.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.520]   I know what he thinks.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.880]   He doesn't have the filter that many other broadcasters have.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:22.920]   And the thing that's been the most remarkable to me is he's one of the very few conservative
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:30.600]   broadcasters that stood up to and continued to oppose Donald Trump with his rise to power.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.800]   What's been remarkable to me is just seeing how he's done that.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:38.440]   And I go and look at his Facebook page sometimes and I look at the vitriol that comes against
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:41.120]   him and I just think to myself, "Joshua, wow.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.000]   You've learned.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.900]   You got scared over the tiny little bit of vitriol that you deal with, and yet how would
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:50.900]   you deal with this?"
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:52.700]   Well, you learn.
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:56.200]   But the thing I always respect and appreciate about Glenn is he says what he thinks and
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.200]   he thinks...
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.320]   And he's true.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.680]   He conveys who he actually is.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.560]   Good things, bad things, warts and all.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:09.080]   And that to me is compelling.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:16.920]   And yet one thing I've learned being in the position of... as a broadcaster, it's hard
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:22.160]   to be vulnerable because you expose something of yourself.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.360]   You expose something of yourself and you put something of yourself out there that people
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.360]   are going to have the possibility of rejecting.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.480]   It's really difficult.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.320]   Again, I'm not asking for your sympathy.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.320]   I chose this path.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.600]   It has many rewards.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.400]   I'm trying to convey it to you so that you can understand.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.040]   That's all.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:48.400]   So I've realized that I've not done a good job of putting into practice some of the things
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.360]   that I think I believe.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.560]   I've tried to be balanced.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:56.800]   I've tried to do all those things.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.280]   And yet I don't believe in that.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.280]   So what am I doing?
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:05.440]   So here's my message for my trolls so I can point them to it.
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.360]   I don't owe you a thing.
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:10.760]   The internet is a free place, at least for now.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.800]   And if you want to fight, fight in the arena of ideas.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.040]   My show is freely available to anyone who wants it.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.880]   No one is forcing you to listen and I'm not charging you a dime for it.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.280]   So thus I owe you nothing.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:26.260]   Now if you disagree with me on something, I hereby invite you to do so.
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.720]   But prove me wrong.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.240]   And here is how I suggest that you do it.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:35.520]   Number one, research your position, understand your presuppositions and use facts, logic
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.880]   and evidence in your argument rather than calling names.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:44.320]   Number two, at least try to understand my position on an issue and the presuppositions
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:50.280]   that I have.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:57.000]   It's important to always do your best to understand your opponent's argument to the fullest extent
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.680]   possible.
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:05.040]   And then identify where I'm wrong and how I made my mistake and then come tell me about
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040]   it.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:11.840]   I recommend that in general you start on your own blog or your own site.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.040]   But if you want to talk to it online, I welcome you there.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.040]   Start on the blog.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.260]   I consider all blog comments.
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:20.680]   And if you're really good and if the conversation is related to finance, we're not going to
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:24.040]   talk about cosmology on Radical Personal Finance.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:27.120]   If the – not that I'm opposed to it.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.480]   I want to stay consistent to the personal finance thread of the show.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.620]   That's very important.
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:35.240]   But if you're really good and your argument is related to finance, then I'll invite you
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.280]   on the show to debate me on the subject.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.120]   And that will give you an opportunity to demonstrate to the listening audience that you're right
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.200]   if you can persuade them and expose your ideas.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.660]   And if you can convince me that I'm wrong, then I'll publicly acknowledge it.
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:52.000]   Just don't use a stupid ad hominem attack.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.240]   For those of you who are not familiar with the term, I'm making up a percentage.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:01.520]   But it just feels like 75% of the attacks that people make are some variation of an
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.360]   ad hominem logical fallacy, which is where you attack the person instead of the idea.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.560]   I do this all the time in most debates that I have with people.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.560]   You write out a long thing and they just attack you.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.440]   Well, you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:15.640]   You're mean or you're nasty or you're insensitive or you're unloving.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.640]   Come on.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.680]   Deal with the issue.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:29.120]   Personally, and many of you are thinking, "Why this somewhat lengthy discourse on Joshua
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:32.160]   and ... Why don't you just do a Joshua?
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.840]   Why are you talking about it?"
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.960]   Frankly, I'm really concerned about the future of free speech.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.840]   I'm very concerned about it.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:49.680]   Now, at the moment, the future, I think, is bright, at least from a technological perspective.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:55.040]   From a technological perspective, things are good.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:14:00.000]   There are more ways to get around government control today with regard to freedom of speech
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.560]   than there's ever been before.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:08.400]   In general, freedom of speech is appreciated by many more people in the world than ever
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.920]   it was before.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:20.880]   So, technologically and to some extent, philosophically, free speech is appreciated.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:29.560]   But the social pressure against the free expression of ideas is immense.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.900]   That's what I've been responding to here, trying to share it with you as somebody who's
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:35.240]   experienced that social pressure.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:45.740]   The social pressure is immense and concerningly, the pressure of big government to finish the
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:54.920]   job is closing in, especially with the forthcoming presidential election in the United States.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:58.440]   Now, I think we're going to escape the problem.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.160]   I really do.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:07.400]   I think that we're going to escape the problem.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:14.640]   The reason is that I'm pretty confident in the impotence of bureaucracy and the limitations
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.640]   thereof.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:19.800]   In general, when I screw something up, create a bureaucracy.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:29.360]   So I'm pretty confident that bureaucracy will render the political winds ineffective.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:32.560]   But I could be wrong about that.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:36.600]   And we might have to fight over it over the next couple of decades.
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:40.280]   I'm very concerned about the coming presidential election in the United States.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:45.720]   Both Trump and Clinton are terrifying when it comes to the idea of free speech and free
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:46.720]   expression of ideas.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.880]   And again, I'm pretty confident, but I'm not 100% confident.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:55.560]   So put it this way, my passports are ready and I've got a bag packed.
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:59.280]   So if I need to get out of the United States and do this from somewhere else, I will cross
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.600]   that bridge when I get to it.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.020]   But the big thing is the social pressure.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:13.200]   The current psychological and social pressure being put on dissidents to conform is immense.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.400]   It's immense.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:23.000]   Now, I'm small fish and I've experienced it personally.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:29.840]   But I bet you have too, whether it's a Facebook comment about an election or a contentious,
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:35.720]   divisive question of some kind, and all of a sudden people jump on you and demand that
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:40.040]   you conform without giving you any reason to do so.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:46.320]   Again, I'm small fish, but man, the pressure that I've experienced over the last two years
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.720]   has been very impactful.
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.080]   I've needed two years to grow some thicker skin.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.400]   I never knew how immense it was.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:59.480]   I can't even imagine what it's like for those people with a huge footprint.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:04.120]   So I hope this is at least interesting to you.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:11.400]   As a listener of the show, I wanted to speak clearly on the subject to convey it to you.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:15.640]   And going forward in the future, I hope you enjoy the work that I'm doing here at Radical
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:16.640]   Personal Finance.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:22.600]   I intend to fully embrace that word that I put in the show title, radical.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:28.720]   And I intend to have serious discussions in a thoughtful, gentle, and respectful way on
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:33.880]   serious and difficult and divisive issues that matter to your bank account and to mine,
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.840]   and that matter to your life and to mine.
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.320]   And the key thing is I'm not trying to screen it based upon trying to maintain some semblance
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.000]   of balance.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.640]   And neither am I necessarily trying to keep it unbalanced.
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.080]   But just the pressure that I've put on myself, it's not you, it's me.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:55.840]   But the pressure that I put on myself is to somehow keep it balanced, to somehow interview
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.600]   somebody from this perspective and somebody from that perspective, and then somehow mix
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.920]   up the order so I don't get too out of whack one way or too out of whack the other way.
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:05.920]   I can't do that.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.580]   That's been really paralyzing to me.
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:08.760]   So I'm done with that.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:13.440]   But that's not to say that I'm not willing to tackle or hear or interview people or discuss
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.440]   subjects from different perspectives.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:22.160]   Just that if you see three shows about politics or about religion, those are always the contentious
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:27.960]   ones, or about how you shouldn't invest in a 401(k) in a row, I'm not trying to filter
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.760]   that in order to keep it diverse.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.240]   There's a huge podcast feed that you can listen to.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.520]   And don't worry, it'll change up in the future.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.640]   That I guess is the biggest thing that you need to know.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.240]   So if you'd like to support the show, I would ask you to do so.
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.960]   And here are four ways that you can do so.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.200]   Number one, I haven't talked much about the business side of the show.
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.760]   I always say this, I'm going to make some changes.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.400]   I am going to make some changes.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:59.000]   But one of the things that I'm very focused on is building the autonomy and the independence
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.920]   of radical personal finance, keeping the show largely free of the influence of sponsors,
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.120]   of corporations, of outside influences.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:13.040]   And to do that, I am continuing to create standalone information products to sell to
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.400]   you.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:20.720]   And I hope to price those products very, very high and make a very nice profit on the sale
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.520]   of that to you.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:23.620]   So I'm working on a few.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:27.460]   But what I would like to ask is, if you have a moment, take a minute and write me an email.
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:33.880]   Email me joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com and ask me a question that you have.
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.880]   Put in the subject line of the email, product question or something similar.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:41.440]   Just tell me the subject or topic or question that you have questions on that I haven't
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.440]   covered on the show.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.320]   I get those from time to time from many of you.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.720]   I'm just asking you, please write me an email, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com and ask me
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:51.320]   a question or tell me the topic that you'd like to hear more shows on.
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:55.520]   Doesn't matter if it's mainstream, doesn't matter if it's radical.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.060]   All of the above are welcome.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:02.920]   Number two, if you'd like to help me and help the show, please take a moment and review
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:07.960]   the show on whatever podcasting platform you use to listen to it.
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:12.440]   These podcast reviews are very helpful to a podcaster for various reasons.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:18.880]   And I generally don't like to come on the show and just ask and solicit your reviews
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:19.880]   all the time.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.080]   That gets really annoying.
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:22.280]   But they are very helpful.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:26.300]   So you can do it in iTunes or Stitcher or the app store on your phone.
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:32.480]   And please do not think that needs to be a three paragraph review.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:34.960]   One or two sentences is perfect and you can do it right on your phone.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:38.200]   Just pull out your phone, pause this for a moment, pull out your phone, write one or
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.200]   two sentences.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.200]   Joshua's show is great.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.200]   He's so smart.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.200]   That'll be nice.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.200]   Joshua's show stinks.
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:44.200]   He is just a jerk.
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.200]   Fine.
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.200]   Doesn't matter.
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.200]   Write the review.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.200]   Number three, please support my show on Patreon.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:54.000]   My Patreon campaign has really suffered in past months and this is my fault due to not
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.760]   structuring it well.
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:56.880]   I will work on that.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:00.800]   But I remain convinced that this is the very best, most ethical way for you to support
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:06.280]   somebody like me who's trying to create for you interesting and useful content.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:11.720]   Because at any point in time, you can either show support financially, change support financially
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:13.760]   or remove support financially.
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:19.960]   And this is the best, most direct feedback mechanism that can possibly exist in the marketplace.
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:23.640]   And so if you would like to do that, I would greatly welcome that.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.640]   You can find that at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:28.640]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:35.520]   Finally, if you would like to support the show or if you'd like just to work with me,
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:38.480]   I'm still doing some consulting calls.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:46.840]   You can book a consulting phone call with me at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall.
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:51.480]   And I keep notes on those, not about your specific situation, though obviously I do
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.520]   have that, but your information is private.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:58.420]   I keep note on the themes because I find it really interesting, the questions that people
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:02.280]   actually want to hire me to talk about because that gives me product ideas for things that
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:07.040]   I can create and sell millions of and make millions of dollars.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.440]   I hope this content today has been useful to you.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.480]   I think it flowed.
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:14.600]   Usually a guy like me, you get to the end of the show and you think, "Wait a second,
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:15.600]   did that make sense?"
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.600]   I hope it did.
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:21.520]   So I just like to communicate clearly, especially for regular listeners.
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.600]   So anyway, that's it.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.840]   Thank you all so much for listening and I will be back with you very soon.
