[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   I have no general custom to speak in a meeting such as this or whenever I preach, apart from
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.600]   expounding the word of God. But I feel that tonight we are met on such a special and unique
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.400]   occasion that I may be permitted a few words before I come to call your attention to the
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.480]   particular verse which I want to consider with you. I simply want to say that I am here
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.080]   tonight with very great pleasure. Indeed, I regard it as a very great privilege. I have
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:46.640]   known these two men whom I regard as brothers and as dear friends, not only for the 25 years
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.960]   that they have been in the ministry, but before that I knew them as students. Mr. Swan has
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.080]   been telling you how they had to fight for their faith in the college that was supposed
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.880]   to be teaching them and grounding them in the faith. But it was quite clear to me from
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.360]   the moment that I met them that these were two men who knew their God and on whom the
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.520]   hand of God had been set quite firmly. It was a joy to watch them then as students and
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.000]   still more after they entered the ministry. It has given me great joy and encouragement
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.440]   being an older man than they are to see them coming along and fighting the good fight of
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:41.120]   faith and standing for the only things that ultimately matter in these evil days in which
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.320]   we find ourselves. Well, I just wanted to say that I thank God for them and their lives
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.200]   and their ministries, and I am sure that I am expressing the feeling of all visitors
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.080]   here tonight when I say that our prayer is that God will increase the pressure of his
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.920]   hand upon them and use them in a yet more striking and signal manner in the years that
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.920]   lie ahead.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.520]   Well, now, it seemed to me that the best thing we could do tonight and the most profitable
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:24.840]   thing would be to consider together the nature of the Christian ministry. I want to do so
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.360]   through calling your attention to the chapter that my friend Mr. DuPont, and let me say
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.440]   it is always a joy to be with him and with my other friend Mr. Peter Golding on any occasion.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.040]   We come together quite often in various ways. Now, I ask Mr. DuPont to read the fourth chapter
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.080]   of the second epistle to the Corinthians because I wanted you to have the full setting and
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.960]   context of verse number five, the fifth verse.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:04.960]   "For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, or Christ Jesus as Lord, and
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:14.160]   ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake." This section of this second epistle to the
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.840]   Corinthians is peculiar in one respect, and that in it, not only this chapter but the
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   previous chapters, the great apostle refers a good deal to himself. Now, that was very
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.760]   unusual with the apostle Paul. As he says, "I preach not myself," and he very rarely
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.320]   makes references to himself, unlike so many today who always seem to be talking about
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.480]   themselves. Paul very rarely does so, and when he does so, he generally has a reason
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.800]   for doing so. And here the reason was quite plain. We find it difficult to believe this,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.240]   actually, but there were many people in the church at Corinth who didn't appreciate
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.560]   the apostle Paul. They were highly critical of him. Some of them had even been dismissing
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:15.320]   him. They'd said, "His presence is weak." Paul was nothing to look at. We understand
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.760]   that he was a short man, bald-headed and with a beaked nose, quite the opposite of a film
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:30.040]   star. They said, "His presence is weak," and his speech, they said, "is contemptible."
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.840]   So they were criticizing him, his personal appearance, his manner of speaking, his message,
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:44.480]   everything else. And they were completely taken in by men whom he describes as false
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.880]   apostles, false brethren. There were such people even in the early church. There's
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.000]   nothing new about that. The church, the true churches, had to fight for their life from
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.840]   the very beginning. And in these early days, as you can read in the third chapter and other
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.120]   parts of this epistle, there were men going around the churches and were very popular.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.320]   They'd set themselves up. God had never called them, and they were writing letters of commendation
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:21.360]   and recommendation, one to the other. And so they were having a highly successful time.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.560]   And they were all criticizing the apostle Paul and even doubting whether he had the
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.600]   right to call himself an apostle at all and criticizing his message.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.560]   Well, now then, in a sense, it's a good thing for us that they did so because it was in
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.360]   replying to them and defending his right to be an apostle that Paul wrote this second
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:53.240]   epistle to the Corinthians. And in this, you see, he does a number of things, and that's
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:02.120]   why I'm calling your attention to it. He shows them the real character of a Christian
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:11.320]   preacher. And at the same time, he shows the true Christian message. So this is not something
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:19.160]   that applies only to ministers. It's equally important for every member of the Christian
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.480]   church. Paul had been greatly troubled by these people. He says, "Without were fightings,
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:33.320]   within were fears." He was a sensitive man, and he was hurt by these people, and his ministry
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.920]   was hindered. So not only has the man in the pulpit to know the nature of the ministry
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.160]   and the real character of the Christian message, it's equally important that every Christian
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.800]   church member should be equally aware of this so that what I'm going to show you now is
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:59.040]   applicable not only to preachers but also to every member of the church. Paul here describes
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:07.920]   his own ministry. This is, after all, the standard of the Christian minister, the Christian
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.600]   ministry and Christian preaching. And that's why I'm so happy to be here tonight. It is
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:22.920]   because our two friends conform to this pattern that we thank God for them and shall go on
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.440]   to pray for their future. Now then, let's look at it like this. Paul puts it in a very
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:40.840]   odd way. He says, "We preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord." What's he mean
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:48.360]   by this? Well, he's comparing and contrasting himself, as I've indicated, with those false
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:56.160]   apostles, those men who set themselves up as preachers and as apostles. And what he's
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   really saying is that they were preaching themselves and not really preaching the gospel.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:11.640]   A true preacher does not preach himself, but he preaches the gospel and its message. Now
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.880]   there are many ways in which a man can preach himself. And it's unfortunately the truth
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:25.240]   to say that in the modern world, as in the ancient world, superficially looking at affairs,
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:33.120]   the more a man preaches himself, the more popular he is likely to be. What do you mean,
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.920]   "I'll preach as someone by preaching himself?" Well, there are many ways in which men can
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:46.880]   do this and are doing it. There are men who really are simply propagating themselves and
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.280]   presenting themselves. You can see it in their very appearance, the attention they pay to
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.320]   personal appearance in dress and the wave in the hair and so many other things. They're
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:06.440]   propagating their own personalities deliberately, clustering their own photographs about, advertising
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:13.720]   themselves and always calling attention in some way or another to themselves. There's
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:20.120]   a great deal of this at the present time, the cult of personality. And people are ready
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.920]   to follow such people in crowds. Hitler had the cult of personality. So unfortunately
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:33.080]   have many men who occupy Christian pulpits or who conduct big Christian meetings. They
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:39.760]   deliberately are presenting themselves and their own personalities in different ways.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.960]   But that's not the only way. I'm not going to wear you with this, but it's important
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.880]   we should realize this. There are many men who are not preaching the gospel but preaching
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:56.080]   their own ideas. This is why the churches are as they are today, speaking generally.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.720]   That's why these men are to endure what they did in their theological colleges. Philosophy
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:09.560]   instead of the Bible message. A man can preach himself by showing his learning, his great
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:15.880]   knowledge of Greek and of Hebrew, always quoting it and people say, "What a learned man."
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.840]   That's preaching yourself. You're calling your attention to your own knowledge and to
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:28.320]   your own learning and to your own understanding rather than to the truth. And in the same
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:34.640]   way such men and others often report. They say it's done to the glory of God, but they're
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.680]   always reporting the results and so on and so forth.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:47.120]   Well, now, there are many ways in which you see men can preach and present themselves.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:54.040]   They're out for a personal following and it's not a difficult thing to do. They get a personal
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   following and they appear to be highly successful in the immediate and for the time being. Now,
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:08.840]   the apostle says he doesn't do that. He's renounced the hidden things of dishonesty.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:16.280]   He's not walking in craftiness. He's not handling the word of God deceitfully, but he says by
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:24.040]   manifestation of the truth, presenting ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.480]   God. Very well.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:32.440]   Now, I want to ask one big question, which I'm going to try to answer. Why didn't the
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:41.080]   apostle Paul preach himself like these others were doing then and like so many are doing
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:48.360]   at the present time? Why didn't he do that? And he gives us the answers himself in this
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.720]   very passage that we are considering together.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:12:01.600]   The first reason why Paul didn't preach himself was that he was not worth preaching. He wasn't
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:09.120]   a fit subject for preaching. Why not? Well, this is the thing that's so characteristic
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:20.160]   of Paul. The apostle Paul never forgot that he was once Saul of Tarsus. He never forgot
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:28.080]   it. It followed him through his life. There he was. What was he? He was a blasphemer.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:34.880]   He was a persecutor of Christ and the Christian faith. He was an injurious person. That's
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:42.880]   what he was. And he would have continued like that were it not that the risen Lord had dealt
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:49.600]   with him and had apprehended him. He says, "I'm not preaching myself because I myself
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:58.640]   was Saul of Tarsus." The man was absolutely blind to all these things, entirely unworthy.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   And I say, therefore, that that was sufficient reason in and of himself.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:09.400]   Paul says of himself, "I am what I am by the grace of God." Well, therefore, I have
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:15.960]   nothing to boast of. I was all wrong and would have remained all wrong. All that I am is
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:23.160]   due to him. So I don't talk about myself. I'm ashamed of that. I talk about him and
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:29.840]   about him alone. He says, "We have received this ministry." He's never tired of saying
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:36.480]   this. There he was, you remember. He'd gone to the authorities in Jerusalem, asking for
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:42.160]   authority to go down to a place called Damascus to exterminate a little group of people known
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.120]   as Christians in a Christian church. And he was so furious against Christianity that he
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:54.520]   was breathing out threatenings and slaughter, anticipating massacring these people. That
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.600]   was the man and he'd have gone on. But then he suddenly had this great experience and
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.040]   he went down the road to Damascus and he turned him right round and he became a preacher of
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:12.640]   the gospel. So he makes it quite clear to us that he is a Christian, not because of
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:20.120]   anything in himself. It's all the grace of God. He's a teacher and a preacher. He has
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:26.080]   an understanding of the message. Why? Not because of his cleverness, not because of
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:32.400]   his scholarship, not because of his learning. He was all that. He was a genius. He was an
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:39.760]   exceptionally able man. But he keeps on telling us, "I have received of the Lord." Unlike
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:46.120]   the moderns, the modernists, the liberals, and many others, he never said that he'd arrived
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:51.840]   at a knowledge of truth by much reading and studying and arguing and learning. And at
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:59.440]   last he'd found it, the exact opposite. He was violently against it and he had to be
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:05.560]   literally knocked down to the ground on the road to Damascus and blinded. And then his
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:12.400]   eyes opened and his spiritual eyes were opened and he was given an understanding of this
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.840]   blessed and glorious truth. So he says, "I can't preach myself. It is nonsense. It's
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:26.000]   monstrous. All has come to me. I've received it all. A dispensation of the gospel has been
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.960]   delivered unto me." And then he gives us one other reason here, under this same heading,
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:40.440]   for not preaching himself, why he's an unworthy subject of his own preaching. And that is,
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:49.520]   we have this treasure in earthen vessels. What do you mean? Well, he goes on explaining
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:59.240]   it. "Death worketh in us, but life in you." Man at his best is a very frail creature.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:09.320]   He's a passing creature. We are earthen vessels. We're all getting older. We become feeble.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:17.280]   Not only that, the history of the church tells us that great men have become heretics in
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:24.240]   spite of their ability and learning and in spite of their experiences. They've gone astray.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.880]   That's why Paul says, "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." That's
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:37.520]   why he says, "Lest I, having preached to others, should myself become a castaway."
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:45.200]   That's the apostle Paul, a humble man who realized the frailty of human nature. Whatever
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:52.240]   gifts we have, how small they are, how frail they are, how they tend to fail and they wane.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:58.960]   And a time comes when we go, we die, we disappear, and the world forgets all about us. We are
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:06.560]   earthen vessels. That's no subject for a man to preach about, says Paul. So I don't preach
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:15.240]   myself. Now that's his first reason. He wasn't a worthy subject of preaching because of these
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:24.520]   things. But let me go on to something still more important. He doesn't preach himself
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:36.440]   because he knew that he was totally inadequate in and of himself to deal with a problem confronting
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:45.560]   the Christian preacher. Now this is very important. Paul says, "I don't preach myself." Why?
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:57.240]   Well, "I know that I myself, as I am, am hopelessly inadequate to deal with the task and the problem
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:03.480]   confronting the Christian preacher." What is that? Now this is where you see it's important
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.680]   that we should all realize this. Not only preachers but also members of churches. These
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:15.120]   foolish people in Corinth, they never had a real conception of the task of the preacher,
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.480]   the evangelist. They never saw it. What is the task of the evangelist? Well, the apostle
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:26.080]   tells us here quite plainly. Let me show you some of the terms which he uses. He says,
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:32.440]   "If our gospel be hid, if there are people who don't believe it and who don't see it,
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:38.760]   it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.040]   them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.600]   of God, should shine unto them." Then in verse 6, "For God who commanded the light to shine
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:55.280]   out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:03.480]   glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." Very well. What is the task of the gospel?
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:10.720]   What's our problem? What are we dealing with? Well, we preach to a world that is outside.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:17.040]   We preach to members who belong to the world outside who come into our services. What is
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:24.800]   the state and the condition of the natural man? What is the state and the condition of
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:31.000]   everybody in the world tonight who is not a Christian? Now, this is the great question,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.240]   and I feel it's absolutely vital to the lives of our churches. I believe that our failure
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:44.320]   today and the absence of true revival is largely due to the fact that as Christians speaking
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:52.760]   generally, we fail to realize the enormous character of the problem confronting us, the
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:59.600]   state of men and women who are not Christian. What is it? Well, now, the danger is that
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:09.200]   we just think of them as men and women who do certain things, drink, take drugs, live
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:18.080]   for pleasure, like reading pornography, and so on and so forth, indulge in abnormal sex
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:28.400]   and so on. We tend to think of the non-Christian solely in terms of his conduct and his behavior,
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:36.120]   and so the tendency is to think of Christianity as a teaching of morality, of conduct and
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:42.920]   of behavior. There are, alas, many people inside the church as well as outside who really
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:50.120]   regard the church and our mission as a kind of negative protest against immorality and
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:56.720]   vice and wrong, that the Christian preacher is here to denounce drunkenness, immorality,
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.680]   vice, separation, divorce, drug-taking, and so on and so forth. And that's all. And if
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:08.960]   these people simply stop doing that, all would be well. Now, that's an utter travesty of
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.480]   the message of the Christian gospel in its understanding of the state of the world. All
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:22.520]   that is true of the world, but the vital question is this. Why does the world live like that?
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:28.840]   Why is the world like that? And the apostle gives us the answer. It is, he says, in a
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:36.400]   state of darkness. This is his comparison. He says, "What's happened to me is comparable
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:42.000]   to what happened of the creation of the world." You read about it in Genesis 1. There was
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.560]   a gross darkness and the Spirit of God brooded over the vast deep darkness. God said, "Let
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:56.600]   there be light." And there was light. Creation comes into being. He says, "That's the comparison."
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:02.480]   The trouble with a man who's not a Christian is not simply that he's living in a wrong
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:13.080]   way. His real trouble is that he's in a state of utter darkness, gross darkness, with regard
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:20.960]   to the essence of man and of a human being. This is their real trouble. You can, by various
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.880]   means, reform morals. It's often happened in the history of the world. But that's not
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:34.480]   our problem. Our problem is this, that men and women are totally ignorant. Now Paul keeps
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.460]   on saying this kind of thing in his various epistles. Listen to him saying it in the epistle
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:46.800]   to the Ephesians in chapter 4. Listen to this. "This I say therefore and testify in the Lord,
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.520]   that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk." How do they walk? "In the vanity of
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:59.080]   their mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:05.880]   the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart, who being past feeling
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:12.640]   have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to walk, to work all uncleanness with greediness."
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:20.400]   That's their condition. Or as he puts it elsewhere, "They are dead in trespasses and sins." The
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:28.040]   man who is not a Christian is ignorant. It's a gross darkness. And he's ignorant of the
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:34.920]   most important things of all. He's ignorant of the fact that he has a soul. He never thinks
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:41.240]   of that. He thinks of men as an animal whose cerebrum is more highly developed than that
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.680]   of most animals. But he rarely believes he's in this world to eat and drink, indulge his
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.600]   sex, make money and have a good time. That's his view of life. He knows nothing about the
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:58.400]   fact that he's got a soul, that he was meant to be a companion of God. He never faces the
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:06.480]   fact of death, still less the fact that there is a judgment beyond death and that his eternal
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:14.000]   destiny is determined by what he does in this life and in this world. They're totally ignorant
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.960]   of this. It's not merely their behavior. It is their spiritual deadness. They are dead
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:27.480]   in trespasses and sins. Or as Paul puts it elsewhere, "The natural man receiveth not
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:33.400]   the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him. Neither can he know
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:38.360]   them, for they are spiritually discerned." It doesn't matter whether he's the ablest
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:45.720]   philosopher or scientist in the country tonight. He's blind spiritually. He may have great
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:53.640]   learning, great knowledge, but he's ignorant of the fact that he's a living soul, a spiritual
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:25:00.640]   being and that he's meant for communion and fellowship with God. That's our problem. Not
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.920]   simply to persuade people to live a better life, but to enlighten their darkness, to
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:12.640]   give them spiritual understanding. No man can possibly do it. Even the Apostle Paul
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.360]   couldn't do it. So he doesn't preach himself. But wait a minute. That's not the whole of
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:24.800]   our problem. It's not merely that men, men by nature, are ignorant and in a state of
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:35.720]   darkness. They are being dominated by the God of this world. If our gospel be hid, it
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:43.880]   is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:50.760]   them which believe not, lest, in order that they may not, believe the glorious gospel
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:58.760]   of Christ. My friends, we are not merely concerned with human ignorance. There's something much
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:05.360]   more terrible at the back of it. Why are men and women in this darkness? Why is our world
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:12.160]   as it is tonight? Why are men preparing for the third world war in this present century?
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:19.080]   Why is there this problem of pornography, permissiveness, and all the breakdown of morals?
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.320]   Why is our world as it is at this minute? Paul says the answer is this. It is under
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:31.160]   the control of the devil. It's not merely men. Again, remember how he puts it in Ephesians
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:39.000]   2. "You," he says, as he quickened, "were dead in trespasses and sins, in whom," he
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.120]   says, "we all had our conversation, wherein in time past ye walked according to the course
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:52.080]   of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:57.880]   worketh in the children of disobedience." That's why the world is as it is. The course
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.800]   of this world. How are people living as everybody else is living? What's determining our people
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.760]   is what they see on the television and the wireless, what they read in the newspapers,
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:14.720]   what they hear other people saying. The course of this world. Well, who determines that?
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:22.000]   Men? No. The prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.200]   of disobedience. It's the devil, the god of this world. Now, if we don't understand this,
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.840]   we don't understand the problem. If we merely think the task is one of immorality, we are
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.880]   missing the whole point. This is the problem. How are we to get men and women out of this
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:47.120]   tyranny and bondage of the devil? We wrestle not against flesh and blood, says Paul. The
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:53.760]   problem is not to persuade men intellectually. We are not up against men. Paul was more than
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:28:00.960]   equal to any man alive. What do we wrestle against? Principalities and powers, the rulers
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:10.600]   of the darkness of this world, spiritual wickedness in high or heavenly places. Christian people,
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:15.720]   are you aware of this? These people in Corinth were not. That's why they were criticizing
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:21.480]   this great man who was aware of it. They wanted philosophy. They wanted learning. And these
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.560]   false apostles were giving them that. That doesn't affect to the slightest extent men
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.000]   and women who are slaves of Satan. There are men and women who pass through Oxford and
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.960]   Cambridge, Harvard and Yale in America, and all the greatest universities of the world
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:43.520]   who are leaders in drug addiction, alcoholism, and all these other foul things that are disgracing
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:50.760]   life today. It's the God of this world, the Prince of the Power of the Air. And our task
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:59.440]   is to deliver people out of his clutches. Can we do it? Can any man do it? Is any man's
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:04.800]   ability as a speaker or as a philosopher or anything else of the slightest value against
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:10.720]   the devil? Well, the answer is this. Adam and Eve were perfect, but the devil got them
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:16.680]   down, and the greatest intellects the world has ever known have all become the slaves
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:23.640]   of the devil. Very well, says Paul, I don't preach myself, because that is the problem.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:33.400]   And then he adds even to that, and it is this. If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:41.280]   are lost. This is the most terrible thing, and that is why I say there is no place in
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:51.560]   the universe that is so terrible in its responsibility as a pulpit such as this. Who are we preaching
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:59.760]   to? We are preaching to men and women who by nature are lost. What's that mean? Well,
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:06.040]   it means what I've been saying, that they're ignorant, that they're the slaves of the devil,
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:12.640]   but it means something much more terrifying. It means that when they come to die, they're
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:21.560]   going on to face God in the judgment and to be condemned to an eternity of misery and
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:31.800]   wretchedness and shame and useless, endless remorse. They are lost. They are outside the
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:38.760]   life of God, and they'll spend their eternity outside the life of God. It's bad enough in
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:44.920]   this world. This world is a living hell now, but it's nothing to what hell itself is, and
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:52.200]   the lost are people who are going to that eternal destiny of hell and of torment and
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:31:00.920]   of utter hopelessness. That's my task, says Paul. Am I to preach and to propagate myself
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:08.680]   and to promote and to present myself when men and women's eternal destiny depends upon
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.600]   the message that I preach to them? I don't preach myself. You know, he keeps on saying
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:20.120]   this. Listen to how he's already put it in chapter two. "Now thanks be unto God," he
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:26.240]   says, "which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:35.400]   of his knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God, a sweet savour of Christ,
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:44.200]   in them that are saved and in them that perish. To the one we are the savour of death unto
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:52.080]   death, to the other the savour of life unto life." And then he asks his famous question,
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:32:01.120]   "Who is sufficient for these things? Little men as I am. Am I the man who in my own knowledge
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:07.080]   and learning and strength can decide whether people are going to heaven or to hell? Am
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:12.760]   I capable of saving people from hell and seeing that they go to heaven?" In the next chapter
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:18.640]   he says, "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ and give an account of things
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:24.920]   done in the body, whether good or bad. Therefore, knowing the terror of the Lord, I persuade
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:32.520]   men." Christian people, are you aware of the problem? There are many men calling themselves
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:38.360]   Christian preachers today who have never seen it. That's why they're emphasizing politics
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:43.440]   and social affairs now. That's why they're simply protesting against communism and against
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:49.780]   various other matters and are not preaching the gospel. They've never seen the problem,
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:57.560]   and that is that men and women are lost outside the life of God and are going to a lost eternity
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:04.640]   with no hope at all. Who is sufficient for these things? "I'm not," says Paul, "and
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:13.160]   therefore I don't preach myself." But let me come to my last, and which is Paul's greatest
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:24.120]   reason of all for not preaching himself. What's that? Well, it is, of course, the glorious
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:32.840]   message that he'd received and which had been committed and delivered unto him. This, of
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:40.160]   course, is the ultimate reason why any man who's a true preacher of the gospel cannot
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:46.820]   possibly preach himself. This is the tragedy of men who are always calling attention to
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:51.400]   themselves and their methods and this, that, and the other, and their own learning and
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:34:00.360]   get their own personal following. They've never seen this message that is in this book
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:07.340]   and that is committed to every true preacher of the gospel, the glory of the message. Did
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.920]   you notice the terms? Have you ever noticed it when you read this passage? Do you always
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:19.600]   notice it? Listen to this. "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost. In
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:26.000]   whom? The God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest what?
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:35.320]   The light of the glorious gospel, the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:41.200]   God, should shine unto them. God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:48.760]   in our hearts. What for? To give the light of the knowledge of what? Of philosophy, of
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:56.200]   science, of politics, of sociology, of morality? No, no. The light of the knowledge of the
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:06.320]   glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:13.440]   Why? That the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us." Have you noticed
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:24.960]   the terms? Glory, particularly glory, glorious gospel, the glory of God. What else? Gospel,
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:32.080]   what's that? Good news. To denounce the drug addict and the alcoholic and the pornographer,
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:37.120]   that's not good news. But the gospel is good news. It's the only good news in the world
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:41.880]   tonight. Do you find any good news in your newspapers? Is there any good news in any
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:48.360]   sense at the moment? There is none at all. It is profound pessimism. The only good news
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:53.760]   in the world tonight is this message. Are we aware of it, Christian people? What other
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:36:03.040]   term does he use? Treasure. We have this treasure. He's preaching a bit of morality and good
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:09.320]   behavior, a treasure. This is one of the most priceless things in the universe. It's beyond
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:17.240]   any computation or estimate. It's a treasure, the most priceless thing in the whole cosmos.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:26.320]   And then the other word, the excellency of the power, the glory of this power. It's excellency.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:32.280]   I'm here tonight, my friends, to make this statement to you. Our churches are as they
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:42.080]   are tonight because we've never really seen the glory, the excellency, the magnificence,
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:47.640]   the gospel which is committed to us. We've never realized what a treasure it is.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:53.800]   And let me just give you some headings, which I plead with you to think and to work out
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:59.260]   for yourselves after you go home and for the rest of your lives. You know what we are missing
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:05.880]   is the glory. Why are the masses of the people outside our churches, in this area and in
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:11.520]   every other country in the world, why are they outside? I can tell you. They regard
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:20.160]   us as little people, ignorant, miserable little people. They think of us often as people who've
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.480]   never read, have never really thought. We don't know what life is. They think we are
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:32.480]   living a life of fear. Good, decent, moral, of course, but self-contained, self-righteous,
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:38.160]   and not really happy. Our attendance at our services proves that we're not really happy.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.920]   Do we give the impression that we're thrilled by it? Do we give the impression that we've
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:48.440]   got the most glorious thing in the universe? Do we give the impression we've got a treasure?
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:54.200]   Do we know anything about the excellency of the power? Do we give an impression of a glory
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:38:01.100]   that is indescribable? That's why people are not attending. It isn't merely the preaching.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:06.920]   It is the members of the church. We have somehow given people the impression that Christianity
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:14.320]   is something small and despicable, and they regard themselves as liberating themselves
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:19.200]   when they stop attending a place of worship, stop reading their Bible, stop believing in
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:25.920]   God. Our responsibility is tremendous. So we must come back and try to grasp what Paul
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:31.960]   tells us here. This is why he didn't preach himself. How could a man who has once seen
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:40.040]   the glory of this message ever preach or call attention to himself and his miserable passing
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:46.920]   little gifts? "Well, what is this glory?" you say. Well, let me give you my headings.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:54.600]   First and foremost, it is the glory of the blessed Holy Trinity. The three persons in
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:02.160]   the blessed Holy Trinity are involved in this message. They have planned it. They have sent
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:10.680]   it to the world. They bring it about. It is theirs, and it is theirs alone. Now, our fathers,
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:17.080]   you know, going back many centuries particularly, they used to talk about a great council in
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:23.600]   eternity between the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. The three persons in the
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:29.040]   blessed Holy Trinity. And they used to say that they met in council to consider what
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:35.880]   could be done with fallen men. God being omniscient, he saw that the fall was coming. And so they
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:41.000]   met together to consider how man could be redeemed from his ignorance, his darkness,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:49.880]   his blindness, his slavery to the devil, and the fact that he was facing death and hell.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:58.800]   And there they planned the way of salvation. And so the three persons take part in this
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:06.680]   great message, this gospel. First and foremost, the glory of the Father. God, who commanded
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:13.320]   the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:23.800]   of what? The glory of God. What is the gospel? What's the message? That I can feel happy,
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:28.520]   that I can have my body healed, that I can have certain experiences. It includes all
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:33.520]   that, but it doesn't stop at that. That's why this idea that what people need is entertainment
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:39.400]   and singing is so contrary to the gospel. The ultimate object of the gospel is to bring
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:46.680]   us to a knowledge of the glory of God. That's the first thing. And if we haven't got that
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:53.040]   knowledge, what we may have is comparatively useless. The glory of God, God the Father,
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:59.480]   what is it? Well, he's the great creator. He's Jehovah great I am. We've been singing
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:05.320]   of him. The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God who said, "Let
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:11.600]   there be light." God is the creator of the universe. He's the sustainer of the universe.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:16.120]   He's the God of providence. He's the God of history. You can't understand history without
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:22.680]   God. God's at the back of everything, but the ultimate truth about God is this, is his
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:29.040]   glory. What's that? It can't be described. It's so marvelous. It includes holiness. It
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:36.800]   includes absolute righteousness. It includes love. But the essence of God is this glory.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:43.720]   God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. Anybody who's ever had a glimpse of the
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:49.120]   glory of God falls down at his feet. John had a glimpse of it on the Isle of Patmos.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:54.480]   He fell down as one dead. The young Isaiah had a glimpse of it, and he said, "Woe is
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:01.160]   unto me. I'm the man of unclean lips." The glory of God, this eternal light, this blazing
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:10.560]   holiness, the glory of God. Yes, but if you really want to see the glory of God, you see
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:20.240]   it in this gospel, which is God's wisdom and God's power. I say it with reverence. God's
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:26.480]   glory is to be seen not even in creation. It's marvelous in creation. Do you see the
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.680]   glory of God as you look at the trees at the present time, and as you look at the bloom
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:36.320]   on the trees and the flowers? Don't you see the glory of God there? Man doesn't produce
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:44.520]   that. God's manifesting his glory in creation, but that is nothing compared to the wisdom
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:52.760]   and the power that God has revealed in this plan of salvation. No man could ever have
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:58.720]   devised it. That's why Paul has said in the first epistle to these Corinthians that the
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:05.480]   preaching of the cross, which to them that perish is foolishness, stumbling block to
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:12.400]   the Jews, foolishness to the Greeks. What's it to us? Christ, the power of God and the
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:20.040]   wisdom of God. The glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. He's already said, "In
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:24.240]   whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:32.840]   light of the glorious gospel of Christ, the Son." What's the glory of the Son? Well,
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:41.280]   the essential glory of the Son is that he is the express image and likeness of the Father.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.720]   As the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it, you know it's not surprising that
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:52.880]   Paul says, "In the face of Jesus Christ." Why? Well, that's where he saw it, wasn't
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:58.680]   it? I've reminded you how a Saul of Tarsus, he was going down that morning to Damascus
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:04.160]   to exterminate the Christian church. Everything out threatens and slaughter. Suddenly he sees
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.920]   a light and a face and a glory. He doesn't know who it is, but he sees the glory and
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.560]   he says, "Who art thou, Lord?" He realized it was some great transcendent Lord. There
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:21.560]   was a radiance, there was a glory shining from this blizzard face. "Who art thou, Lord?
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:31.560]   I am Jesus whom thou art persecuting." The glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:37.160]   Jesus Christ, my friends, was truly a man. But as so many are saying today, he was only
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:43.920]   a man. That's a lie. He was also truly God. He's co-equal and co-eternal with the Father.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.960]   He's the express image and the likeness of the Father himself. This is his essential
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:56.720]   glory. Yes, but again, if you really want to see and to know the glory of the Lord Jesus
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:05.040]   Christ, the Son of God, you must look at him lying in a manger, in a stable in Bethlehem.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:13.840]   Do you see the glory there? Veiled in flesh, the Godhead. See, here is his glory. That
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:20.880]   to deliver you and me from being lost and from hell, he laid aside the signs of this
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:30.080]   transcendent glory and was born in the likeness of sinful flesh. Came in the form of a servant,
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:37.640]   was made under the law, born of a woman, entered the world in poverty, worked with his hands,
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:43.000]   suffered the indignity and the rudeness of men and women, misunderstanding and scorn
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:50.400]   and rejection, eventually even going to the cross, subjected to temptation in the wilderness,
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:57.680]   dying on the cross, being buried in a grave. Why? That you and I might be saved. He didn't
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:04.240]   consider it something to be held on to, to be equal with God. He made himself of no reputation.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:09.240]   Aren't you moved by that glory? Aren't you thrilled by it? Aren't we just good
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.320]   little people who think we're wonderful because we come to church twice on Sunday
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:18.600]   or perhaps even once? Shame on you if you do. You are here because you've seen the
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:26.040]   glory of this person who lays aside the signs of the glory for the time being and endures
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:32.920]   all this in order that you and I might be saved. Paul says in the next chapter, "God
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:38.360]   hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:43.280]   of God in him." Have you seen his glory? Where do you see it? Look at the cross. When
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:51.680]   I survey the wondrous cross, it's wondrous. Why? Because the Prince of Glory died there.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:59.120]   The author of life expired on it. That's the glory, that you and I might be saved from
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:08.280]   being lost and might have eternal glory, the glory of his death and the glory of his resurrection.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:14.680]   Aren't you thrilled by it? Aren't you moved by it? These people in Corinth thought philosophy
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:21.160]   was superior to this kind of thing. What about you? Do you glory in the cross? Do you glory
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:28.360]   in the resurrection when he bursts us under the bands of death and rose triumphant o'er
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:35.480]   the grave, ascended unto heaven and is seated at the right hand of God in the glory of everlasting
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:42.280]   and then the glory that is yet to come when one day he'll come back again, not as Jesus
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:50.640]   of Nazareth but as the King of Kings, as the Lord of Lords, riding the clouds of heaven.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:58.160]   He'll come to judge the whole world in righteousness and we shall see his glory and every eye shall
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.960]   see his glory and those foolish people who have rejected him, who have dismissed him,
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:09.720]   who have denied him with their kings and princes will cry out into the rocks and into the mountains
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:17.480]   to hide them from his glory who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, the
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:25.320]   glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and then the glory of the Holy Spirit.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:33.060]   Where do I find that? Listen. We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:42.620]   of the power might be of God and not of us. I've told you that the problem confronting
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:48.500]   the preacher is how to deal with the ignorance and the darkness of people, how to get them
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.440]   out of the clutches of the devil, how to enable them to see that they're sinners, that they've
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:57.960]   got souls, that they've got to meet God in judgment and the faith that awaits them if
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:05.320]   they don't. How can we do this? How can we convict people of sin? Can any man do it?
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:11.720]   Of course he can't. It's impossible. Before a man can be convicted of sin, he must have
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:20.360]   the power of the Holy Ghost. The excellency of the power must be of God and not of man.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:25.520]   And so though the preacher may be a small and a feeble man, if he's filled with the
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:31.840]   Spirit, there is a power in him that can bring men and women to conviction of sin, can open
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:37.320]   their eyes to see their darkness, their lost estate, to give them faith and capacity to
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:43.560]   believe. That's why Paul says in the first epistle to these people in chapter 2 that
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:49.320]   when he came amongst them, he came not with the excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:58.160]   unto them the power of God. How then? In demonstration of the Spirit and of power. Why? Well, it's
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:05.280]   the only way whereby a man can be saved. It's the Spirit alone that can convict us of sin
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:12.080]   and reveal to us the glory of Christ, the meaning of his death as our substitute and
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:18.960]   all that belongs to the Christian message. And the glory of the Spirit is this, that
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:26.880]   though he is equal to the Father and to the Son, he has made himself subservient to them.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:34.840]   And they've both sent him to the church in order to bring to us the salvation that the
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:42.560]   Father planned, the Son came to execute, and which the Spirit alone can explain and expound
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:50.440]   to us with power. Very well, there you see the glory of this message. This is why I don't
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:57.480]   preach myself, says Paul. Fancy a man calling attention to himself, going into a pulpit
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:02.680]   or on a platform, cracking a few jokes to make people laugh, trying to wheedle them,
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:08.800]   entertaining them by singing or by dancing or by drama or miming, instead of preaching
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:15.560]   this glorious gospel. The glory of the Father, the glory of the Son, the glory of the Holy
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:22.160]   Ghost, and the glory that comes to us as a result of believing this. What is it? Free
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:29.840]   pardon and forgiveness. Do you realize what that means? All your sins blotted out like
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:36.040]   a thick cloud. Not only that, you are born again. Men and women can only believe this
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:41.560]   when they are born again. The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:47.800]   He's got to become a spiritual man. Can any preacher recreate a soul? Of course he can't.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:56.800]   But the Spirit can. Born again of the Spirit, made children of God, adopted into God's family,
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:03.760]   we can pray to God daily with assurance. He said he'll never leave us nor forsake us.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:11.200]   See the streams of living waters flowing from eternal love. Well supply thy sons and daughters
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:17.440]   and all fear of want remove. This is what enables a man to say, "I am persuaded that
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:23.720]   neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:30.240]   come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall separate me from the love of God which
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:36.520]   is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Oh the glory of this great salvation. My dear people, have
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:43.180]   you seen it? Are we giving the impression to the world that is outside in our preaching
[00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:52.560]   from pulpits, in our daily lives and living, that we are possessors of this glorious gospel
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:59.920]   which has given us a glimpse of the glory of the Father, the glory of the Son and the
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:11.760]   glory of the Holy Ghost and which makes us in turn rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:18.320]   This is a passing world. It's an earthen vessel world. If a third world war comes, it's the
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:23.160]   end of the civilization. It's the end of the world as we've known it. And there are men
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:28.040]   today saying that who are not Christians at all. Is that the end? Is there no hope? Not
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:39.200]   at all. We have an inheritance, says Peter, which is incorruptible and undefiled and that
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:47.960]   fadeth not away. Reserved in heaven for us by God. Let them let off all their atomic
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:56.240]   bombs at the same time. Let hell be set loose. Nothing can separate us who believe this glorious
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:05.160]   gospel from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. The business of the ministry
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:13.640]   and of preaching is to make known that glory and every church member is to make the same
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:20.440]   glory known. And that's why if you see this, you won't go in for ministers who've got a
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:27.760]   long string of academic qualifications. You'll seek men who are filled with the Spirit and
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:35.080]   of power. Men who are prepared to be nothing, that the glory of God may be everything. So
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:44.320]   you're all involved in this. And our responsibility is tremendous. But the moment you see that
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:51.440]   the real task is the condition of men and women as they are by nature, you realize that
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:58.360]   men can't do it. And then you know you begin to pray for revival. Are you praying for revival?
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:03.400]   Do you pray every Sunday that the Spirit of God may come down upon your preachers? Are
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:09.120]   you praying for an outpouring of the Spirit of God? If you're not, it's because you haven't
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:16.040]   realized the task confronting us. Of men and women in darkness, blinded by the God of this
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:22.560]   world under the dominion of Satan and going to a lost eternity. Nothing but the Spirit
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:30.120]   and His power, the excellency of His power, can possibly save them. So we're all on test.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:37.040]   The more you realize the problem, the more you will pray without ceasing for an outpouring
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:44.440]   of the Spirit of God upon every preacher of the gospel. And you'll go on doing so until
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:51.560]   God in His grace hears us and deigns to visit us again. May He continue to bless our two
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:56:00.960]   brothers more and more abundantly, but may He make of all of us intercessors for a lost
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:06.320]   world ere it be too late. Let us pray.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:16.000]   Oh Lord, our God, we pray that Thou wouldst have mercy upon us. We are so much influenced
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:23.120]   by the mind and the thinking of this present world. We confess that so often we fail to
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:30.720]   realize the depth of the problem and also the excellency of the power and the glory
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:39.360]   of the gospel. Lord, open all our eyes and bring us to this realization and then authenticate
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:47.720]   our message by sending Thy Spirit upon us in a mighty awakening that will shake us and
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:57:00.320]   shake the world to Thine everlasting glory. In Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.
