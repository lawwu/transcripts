[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   If you're looking to rack up way more points and miles,
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.400]   but without spending more money
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.960]   or opening up another credit card,
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.480]   you are in luck because today,
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.560]   I'm gonna share over 50 of my favorite tactics
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.720]   that you can use to earn more points,
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.040]   travel more for free, but without increasing your spending.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.720]   Some of these little known tricks are so great and easy
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.120]   for anyone to use to earn more points
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.280]   on everything from buying gas and coffee
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.280]   while you're traveling,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.920]   or even from your utilities or banks.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.800]   I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.760]   I love helping others find deals and earn more points.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.400]   And if you enjoy this video, give us a thumbs up,
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.680]   or if you have a question, leave it in the comments.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.680]   And if you wanna keep upgrading your life, money,
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.080]   and travel, consider subscribing.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.800]   Let's jump in first and start talking about shopping portals
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.120]   because I think this is one of the biggest ways
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.320]   that you can earn extra points without spending money
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.440]   beyond what you're already spending.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.440]   So I personally love Cashback Monitor.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.480]   And the reason I love it is because you can go
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.000]   into any retailer.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.160]   So I'm looking right now and say,
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.640]   oh, I wanna buy something at Nike.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.600]   And it'll actually show you where you can earn
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.320]   the most points per dollar or cashback
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.680]   across all the different programs.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.240]   They have credit card point programs.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.040]   They have travel points and miles programs,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.280]   meaning airlines and hotel groups.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.400]   But then they also have other programs like Rakuten,
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.640]   which I will get to.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.480]   So there are a bunch of different ways
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.760]   that anytime you're looking at any retailer online,
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.360]   I think you should probably go in and look
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.360]   at whether there is cashback.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.520]   There are browser extensions for certain ones,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.560]   but I like Cashback Monitor
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.800]   'cause you can actually pick the best place.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.000]   Now, almost every airline offers
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.200]   some sort of shopping portal.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.840]   United, Delta, American, Southwest, Alaska, JetBlue,
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.600]   some of the international ones as well.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.400]   And then Wyndham is probably one of the only
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.160]   hotel programs that does.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.400]   And then Rakuten is also a really great option
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.560]   because you can link your Rakuten account
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.520]   to your Amex account and earn Amex points.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.320]   So instead of just earning United points
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.400]   or Southwest points, you can actually earn Amex points,
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.120]   which as you all know, are a transferable point
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.040]   that makes it really, really easy
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.680]   to transfer to lots of different airlines and hotels.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.000]   Rakuten also usually has a referral promo
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.680]   that you can check out on the deals page on our website.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.840]   I'm actually just looking at the Rakuten site right now.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.280]   And there's a ton of stuff here
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.760]   that I think are pretty obvious things people might use.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.600]   Choice Hotels, Sixt, Viator, Old Navy, Zappos.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.520]   I didn't even think about that.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.960]   We just ordered from Zappos.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.040]   I'm gonna ask Amy whether she thought to use Rakuten.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.200]   Knowing her, she probably did.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   She's more on top of the cash back than I am usually,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.760]   but lots of great options.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.640]   Some of these like Rakuten, United, Alaska, and JetBlue
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.200]   also have card-linked features
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   so that you can link your card
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.640]   and earn when you're shopping in-store.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.760]   Also keep your eye out for Shopping Portal bonuses
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.080]   because sometimes they have bonuses and elevated rates.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.520]   There are some weeks where Rakuten is 10X on everything.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.160]   It's changing all the time.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.400]   One really cool thing that you can get on Cashback Monitor
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.840]   is you can actually see the history of the earnings.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.280]   So you can look at what's the best cash back rates.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.520]   You can look at what are the best point rate histories,
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.680]   credit card points.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.640]   And so you can get a sense of,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.880]   wow, is this often a category
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.480]   where I could earn 10% back on Rakuten,
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.280]   which is effectively 10 Amex points per dollar?
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.520]   And right now it might be two,
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.120]   but it looks like it goes to 10 every couple of weeks.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.200]   Maybe if I'm making a really big purchase,
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.280]   I should hold out.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   So Shopping Portals is a massive place
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.680]   that I earn a bunch of points.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.520]   Now I'll keep in mind,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.920]   if going to Cashback Monitor is too much work
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.440]   that you don't do anything,
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.600]   you're probably better off just picking one.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.120]   Maybe it's Rakuten where you can get transferable points,
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.680]   installing their browser extension,
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.120]   and not really worrying about it.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.280]   The only other thing I'll make sure
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.600]   that is worth calling out
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.080]   that applies to a lot of the things
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.640]   we're talking about today
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.760]   is that this episode is all about earning more points.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.160]   So I'm not gonna talk about ways
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.760]   that you can earn more money,
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.120]   but there are times where you might say,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.720]   well, the United Portal will give me one point per dollar,
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.800]   but some cashback portal might give me 20% cashback.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.940]   Well, in that case,
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.000]   you're probably gonna wanna optimize for the cashback
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.760]   and not optimize for the points.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.520]   So I'm gonna focus only on ways to earn points today,
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.840]   but you always wanna make sure
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.120]   that you're not giving up something worth more
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.560]   than those points to get them.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.760]   Okay, so shopping portals, great option.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.840]   Unfortunately, you won't find Amazon
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.160]   on a lot of those shopping portals.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.360]   However, I did find a little trick
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.400]   reading an article on Frequent Miler
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   that you can get 3x JetBlue points on Amazon
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.160]   if you're making purchases
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.400]   while you're on their Wi-Fi on flight.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.520]   I haven't confirmed that this is always working,
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.440]   but at least according to the internet, it is.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.000]   So if you do have a JetBlue flight coming up,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.800]   might be a great time to do some of your Amazon shopping
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.580]   and get 3x points on that flight.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.600]   Another option for earning extra points
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.520]   when you're shopping online, if you have an Amex card,
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.400]   is to go look at all of the card-linked offers they have.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.840]   Right now, I'm looking, there's 267.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.480]   Most of them are gonna be cashback offers,
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.420]   but there are 19 right now that are points-related offers.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.640]   So if you're trying to get more points, for example, here,
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.180]   it says spend $25 or more at Pete's Coffee
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.560]   and get 1,000 membership rewards points up to three times.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.160]   That's actually a pretty good offer from an ROI standpoint.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.960]   I'm surprised I didn't see that and talk about it sooner,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.520]   but it expires in four days,
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.000]   which means by the time you hear this, it will be expired.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.480]   But there are often things in here
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.640]   where you can earn extra points
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.360]   in addition to cashback offers
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.040]   that are there much more frequently.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.040]   If you wanna make sure that all of these offers
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.100]   are just auto-added to your cards,
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.840]   definitely check out Card Pointers
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.720]   and specifically Card Pointers Pro.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.760]   If you're watching the video,
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.240]   you would have seen that as soon as I went to this site
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.960]   just now, Card Pointers auto-loaded every offer
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.940]   on every card, so it's always there.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.960]   And then it actually makes it easy
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.560]   in the Card Pointers app to search,
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.380]   "Hey, do I have any offers for Macy's?"
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.320]   And it'll tell you where you have those offers
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.300]   and which cards, so you know which card to use.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.980]   A few others worth calling out,
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.440]   United has this app called United Mileage Plus X,
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.720]   and it's kind of like a shopping portal app
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.880]   bundled around one particular program, which is United.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.280]   Unfortunately, it doesn't work on the web,
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.320]   but fortunately, one of the things that's unique about it
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.460]   is that it lets you buy gift cards
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.660]   and earn United Miles doing that.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.440]   So if you wanted a lot of United Miles
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.140]   and you knew you were about to make a purchase
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.760]   at Airbnb for a trip, you could go buy an Airbnb gift card
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.220]   in the Mileage Plus X app.
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.060]   And I have heard that they pass along the merchant code
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.740]   of the gift card, so if you're buying a travel gift card,
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.060]   you can still get the points as if you spent on travel.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.660]   And then sometimes they even give bonuses
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.420]   if you use a United card to do that.
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.940]   That said, there are a lot of places online
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.620]   where you can get cash back for gift cards
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.580]   or you can buy gift cards at a discount.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.240]   So always make sure you're not buying a full price gift card
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.580]   to get three points per dollar
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.180]   when you could have bought that gift card for 15% off.
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.500]   So keep that in mind.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   And then the other site worth bringing up here
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.140]   is Simply Miles, which is a similar platform
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.280]   that American has where you can find a lot of offers
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.260]   to earn bonus miles and loyalty points on American.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.380]   When I logged in, there were 72 offers
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.740]   that I could link to my card, but you do need a master card.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.780]   It's similar to the offers you get when you log in
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.460]   and link your Citi, Bank of America,
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.380]   or Amex offers to your cards,
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.800]   but it doesn't require you to have those
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.460]   and they're slightly different offers.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.540]   So Simply Miles is an interesting one
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.380]   that'll actually come up again at the very end of this
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.860]   because there is one of the best opportunities
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.140]   for miles ever through Simply Miles.
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.900]   On shopping, there's also a site called MyPoints.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.580]   And right now, if you just sign up for MyPoints,
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.660]   which is a little bit of a shopping portal,
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.400]   but it also does a few other things.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.700]   Right now, when you shop and spend $50
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.500]   in your first 30 days, you get 1500 bonus miles on United
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.420]   plus 250 when you sign up.
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.100]   So you can get almost 2000 miles
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.340]   just for a pretty small amount of work.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.940]   And then you also earn points when you're shopping,
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.420]   when you're filling out surveys.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.620]   And then you can also scan your grocery receipts
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.220]   to get more points.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.180]   It's a little unclear how you redeem those points.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.980]   It seems to imply that you can redeem them for United,
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.400]   but I haven't actually created the account.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.100]   So I don't know the answer to that question,
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.340]   but you could definitely earn almost 2000 miles
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.360]   just by signing up.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.840]   So worth being in here.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.120]   And speaking of surveys,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.840]   there are a handful of survey programs.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.680]   So on almost every website for an airline,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.220]   you can find a list of all of the programs
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.780]   they have that are partners.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.900]   And that's actually an important thing
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.900]   because I'm not gonna mention every single partnership.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.300]   So when I look at United's website right now,
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.500]   I'm gonna mention the highlights.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.900]   They have a shopping portal,
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.620]   but there's some small things in here like Therabody.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.060]   You can earn six miles per dollar
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.260]   spent on Therabody products.
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.180]   I didn't go through and include every single merchant
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.180]   and every single deal because that would just be a lot.
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.140]   I tried to include the bigger ones
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.300]   that were broadly applicable.
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.700]   But one category, for example, flowers.
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.740]   Pretty much every single airline,
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.160]   if you go to their website,
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.260]   or if you look at the cashback portals,
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.520]   there are massive returns on flowers.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.860]   There must be really, really high margins in flowers.
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.340]   So I would say if you go to any of the airline,
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.860]   go to like earn miles, name of airline,
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.140]   name of hotel group,
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.460]   and almost every single one of them
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.820]   has a place on the website
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.600]   where you can find all the different ways
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.500]   that you can earn points outside of just flying.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.680]   When it comes to surveys,
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.180]   there is a site called eRewards.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.620]   And on eRewards, you take surveys, you earn points,
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.100]   and then you can redeem those points.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.060]   And they have a bunch of partners
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.820]   where you can redeem them for American,
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.180]   Hilton, Alaska, United, JetBlue.
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.780]   So pretty wide ability to use your points.
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.680]   Downside is it didn't seem like the best use of time.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.240]   So there were a couple of surveys
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.680]   that I had the option to take.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.020]   There was an eight-minute survey that offered one point
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.300]   and a 37-minute survey that offered eight points.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.580]   So I guess from points per minute,
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.540]   it's like that last one was about a little more than four.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.900]   So let's round up to be generous
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.260]   and say five minutes per point.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.980]   And it took 25 points to get 500 miles from an airline.
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.460]   So if you're spending five minutes per point,
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.620]   that means that you're gonna spend 125 minutes
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.900]   to get 500 miles.
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.140]   125 minutes for 500 miles is,
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.240]   I don't know if that's the best use of time.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.800]   Spend two hours of your time to earn 500 miles,
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.900]   which typically let's say are worth 2 cents, $10.
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.620]   Probably not a good use of time.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.740]   If you happen to have a job
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.420]   where you're required to sit in front of a computer
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.860]   and you can't do anything else, but you don't have to work,
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.580]   maybe it's worth filling out surveys.
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.840]   If you wanna encourage your kids
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.600]   to fill out surveys for you, maybe that works,
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.740]   but I doubt they'll meet the panel requirements.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.460]   But it is an option to earn points.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.020]   And most of the airlines, as well as Hilton,
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.380]   have their own white label survey for points programs.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.140]   I have noticed that depending on your role
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.280]   and function in your career,
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.800]   there might be better opportunities.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.240]   So if you're a senior executive,
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.880]   maybe there are some of these panels that you could be on
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.800]   that will pay a lot more.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.080]   When I went in as someone who was self-employed,
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.000]   the best I got was 37-minute survey for eight points.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.600]   Now, I didn't take the survey.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.320]   Maybe I could have taken it a little faster,
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.240]   but it seemed like not a good use of time.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.640]   Let's think about a little bit more ways
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.960]   that you spend money locally
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.840]   that you might be able to earn a lot more points.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.180]   So a big one is dining.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.040]   And most airline and hotel loyalty programs
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.980]   also have a dining program.
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.300]   They're almost all run by the same underlying company.
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.940]   And so if you link your credit card, which is how it works,
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.280]   you link any card.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.460]   So let's say you go to your Delta dining program,
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.240]   you could link your Amex card.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.780]   And then when you go to a restaurant,
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.500]   you earn Delta points.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.380]   Now, if you go and link that card
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.580]   to another dining program,
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.020]   you get removed from the other one.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.980]   So you can only have your cards linked
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.780]   to one dining program at a time,
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.100]   but you usually earn points for dining.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.580]   And sometimes if you opt into their emails,
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.460]   you get a higher earn rate.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.240]   And sometimes if you review a restaurant,
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.460]   you get extra points.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.140]   And so I currently have all of my cards
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.240]   linked to Built's dining program,
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.620]   because I find their points the hardest for me to earn
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.940]   and the most valuable.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.340]   So for me, I'm like,
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.060]   let's earn as many built points as I can.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.980]   So that's a great way to earn points on dining.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.500]   There's often restaurants that you're already going to
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.760]   that you can earn points on.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.060]   So great option there.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.080]   And to be clear, you don't need a Built card
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.300]   to use the Built Rewards dining program.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.500]   And that's actually true of a lot
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.760]   of the Built Rewards program.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.640]   You don't need their credit card
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.480]   to get a lot of their benefits.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.000]   So you can sign up for Built Rewards.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.980]   You can play some of their games every month
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:37.980]   and earn points.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.740]   And there are actually a lot of ways to earn points
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.700]   through Built without having their credit card.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.540]   On the dining front,
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.540]   there's also a website that IHG has,
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.920]   where if you book an open table reservation
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.900]   through the IHG site,
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.460]   you earn 150 IHG points per reservation.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.260]   So easy to bookmark that.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.000]   Anytime you're making a restaurant reservation,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.500]   if it's on open table, you can earn some IHG points.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.880]   When it comes to drugstores,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.060]   as of recording this,
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.880]   Built just announced a partnership with Walgreens,
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.180]   where again, a Built Rewards member,
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.040]   not necessary to have the card,
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.900]   you can link any of your existing credit cards
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.300]   to their program.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.340]   And they'll do a few things.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.500]   One, anytime you shop at Walgreens,
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.700]   you'll earn 1X Built points on everything.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.260]   You'll earn 2X points on Walgreen branded purchases,
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.780]   and then another 100 points for every prescription refill.
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.340]   And so that's on top of whatever
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.780]   your linked card is getting.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.220]   So if you link a card that earns three points per dollar
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.100]   at drugstores, you could get another one point
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.520]   on everything, two on Walgreens,
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.060]   and then prescription points on top of that.
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.020]   On top of that, Walgreens is passing along data
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.940]   about what products that you're purchasing are FSA eligible.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.180]   And Built's gonna notify you,
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.500]   "Hey, here's a product you could reimburse
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.960]   with your FSA if you have one at work."
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.020]   So it has a little side benefit as well.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.380]   I've already gone in and linked my drugstore card
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.500]   in that program.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.860]   And it'll be a great way to earn a few extra points a year.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.900]   If you're a Starbucks fan,
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.380]   they have a partnership with Delta,
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.300]   where you get double stars on your Delta travel days,
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.460]   as well as anytime you reload your Starbucks account
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.580]   with $25 or more, you get bonus miles for Delta.
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.660]   And it's a sliding scale.
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.060]   If you load $25, you get 25 miles,
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.480]   but if you load $100, you get 200 miles.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.280]   So this is on top of whatever you're earning, of course,
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.120]   for your credit card
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.140]   and whatever Starbucks rewards you're getting.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.260]   So this is one where, if you're a Starbucks fan,
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.340]   you should just be earning free Delta miles,
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.180]   and you should just reload your balance
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.980]   instead of spend your credit card,
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.140]   and you'll get extra points on Delta,
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.820]   which who doesn't want some free miles?
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.720]   When it comes to groceries, this isn't that straightforward,
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.900]   but there is a way to get points on groceries.
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.580]   And if you live near and shop at a Safeway,
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.840]   Cars, or Albertson's Grocery Store,
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.540]   they have a Just For You program.
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.040]   It's part of their rewards,
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.700]   where as you spend money, you earn reward points.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.400]   Sometimes you can use those for discounts on fuel,
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.980]   but it turns out that they have a promotion
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.820]   with Alaska Airlines, where you can redeem
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.580]   those Just For You points for Alaska miles.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.980]   And it turns out the program is actually pretty good.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.040]   Like the value of the redeeming towards your groceries
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.120]   is not as good as the value of getting Alaska miles.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.700]   However, you do need to go in and put in a zip code
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.700]   for your local store address in Alaska for it to work,
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.980]   and you end up being able to get a reward
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.340]   is worth anywhere from one reward is 100 miles,
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.120]   all the way up to seven rewards is 1300 miles,
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.660]   but it's a pretty decent redemption.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.060]   I'll link to a article in the show notes
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.340]   that Frequent Miler wrote about how to do this
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.500]   and how to set it up.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.280]   But if you shop at any of those grocery stores,
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.020]   definitely a way to earn some extra points.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.900]   Speaking of local, if you happen to live in Washington State
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.620]   or the address on your Delta account
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.340]   is in Washington State, there is a site
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:55.340]   that went live this week at 12status.com
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.700]   where you earn one mile on Delta
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.820]   for every Seattle Seahawks passing yard the entire season.
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.140]   Last season, it would have been 4,167 miles,
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.140]   at least according to ChatGPT.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.100]   And so if you live in Washington State
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.740]   or at least the address of your Delta account
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.300]   is in Washington State,
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.780]   definitely register at 12status.com
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.900]   to get some free miles this football season.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.660]   As far as going to live events,
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.020]   there are two ways to do that.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.320]   Ticketmaster does have a program with Delta also
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.060]   where you get one mile per dollar
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.840]   on eligible Ticketmaster purchases in the US.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.300]   I will say that oftentimes Ticketmaster shows up
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.140]   on a lot of shopping portals.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.320]   So you definitely wanna make sure
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.400]   if you're buying something on Ticketmaster,
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.940]   yes, you could get one Delta mile,
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.980]   but if you could get 10% cash back,
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.100]   maybe that'd be a lot better.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.540]   There's also a site called Audience Rewards,
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.620]   which is where you can go
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.180]   and to book Broadway and off-Broadway shows.
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.980]   And they have a partnership with United
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.540]   that you can find on their website
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.340]   where when you book shows, you can earn miles.
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.540]   And so sometimes it's 100 miles a ticket,
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.740]   sometimes it's 700 miles a ticket,
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.740]   but if you're already gonna go buy tickets,
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.740]   might be worth just getting a few extra miles
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.020]   anytime you're doing that.
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.700]   There are sometimes some bonus offers
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.180]   up to about 2,000 miles on certain shows.
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.460]   Last, I mentioned fuel briefly.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.060]   If you buy fuel at a Shell station
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.900]   and you wanna earn some American Airlines points,
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.380]   you can link your Shell rewards to your AA account
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.860]   and end up getting more points that way.
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.640]   So you get 250 points when you enroll
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.540]   and then you get another three miles on AA
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.260]   for every gallon of fuel you buy.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.820]   Obviously, I wouldn't go spend more money
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.720]   to buy gas at Shell just to earn points
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.100]   if it's an extra 30, 40 cents a gallon.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.160]   But if you regularly shop at Shell, great option.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.300]   We actually have electric cars,
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.820]   so the only thing I'd be filling up is a Vespa
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.100]   where we fill up like a gallon of gas
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.660]   every two to three months.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.240]   So not one that I'm taking advantage of,
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.580]   but if you fill up at Shell a lot for gas,
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.420]   great way to earn some American miles,
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.420]   which by the way are pretty difficult to earn
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.460]   because they're not a transfer partner of any program.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.540]   Now let's talk about travel.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.180]   Now, the obvious way to earn points and miles
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.020]   when traveling is on your airline flights,
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.980]   you put in your mileage number for your airline program
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.820]   and you earn miles.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.840]   Some programs even let you earn miles
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.140]   when you're booking flights with miles.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.640]   Used to be that flights with miles are nothing.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.660]   Now that's not the case on certain airlines.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.340]   So I figured that's a bit obvious.
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.100]   The two edge cases that are maybe not obvious are one,
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.040]   when you're flying on airlines
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.460]   that you aren't familiar with overseas,
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.000]   you might not realize that they sometimes are partners
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.820]   of airlines that are worth collecting miles in.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.460]   So in the case of our trip to Europe,
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.980]   we flew on Transavia, which if they had a loyalty program,
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.340]   I probably wouldn't enroll in it,
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.100]   but they were partnered with Flying Blue
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.180]   so I could earn some Air France points.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.720]   And then we flew on Condor Airlines,
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.380]   which surprisingly is partnered with Alaska.
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.300]   So I earned a bunch of Alaska miles flying on Condor,
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.220]   which is great as well.
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.100]   So anytime you're flying on an international airline,
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.740]   take a look and see if they're partnered with any airlines
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.940]   that you try to collect points and miles with
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.900]   because you might be able to earn your points there.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.960]   The last one is if you have children,
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.780]   you should definitely be opening up accounts in their name
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.420]   for their mileage programs.
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.700]   So they start earning miles
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.820]   as soon as you're buying paid seats for them.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.100]   So about two years old,
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.020]   if you're doing the lap infant thing before that,
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.700]   which is what we did.
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.880]   Both of our daughters have mileage accounts
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.220]   on every airline that they've flown on.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.720]   And so they've built up a little bit of a balance.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.760]   It's not too big, but I'm hoping that by the time
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.000]   they're ready to start booking their own travel,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.520]   maybe they've racked up enough points
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.640]   to give them a little bit of a headstart on something.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.300]   So that's how to earn airline miles.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.700]   On flights, let's talk about hotels and home rentals
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.620]   'cause there are a lot of interesting partnerships here.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.240]   Obviously you can earn hotel points
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.040]   when you're staying in hotel rooms.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.780]   The only hack here would be if you wanna really try
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.060]   to aggregate points in one place.
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.620]   So for example, when my wife and I are traveling,
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.780]   I earn all the Marriott and Hyatt points,
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.740]   she earns all the Hilton points.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.940]   Something that works pretty well is you could book a room
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.540]   in whoever's name earns the points, put in the notes,
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.040]   the other person is checking in.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.780]   And usually it's no problem for the other person to check in
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.820]   and keep the other person on the reservation.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.380]   So if I were gonna stay at a Hilton without my wife,
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.260]   I would probably still book it in her name
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.500]   and have a note that says,
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.140]   "My husband will be checking in before me."
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.980]   So that we could just continue to both use her status
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.180]   and earn points there.
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.220]   But you can actually also earn airline points
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.960]   sometimes booking hotels.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.460]   And you could do it in about three different ways.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.020]   So one way that I'm not a big fan of is some hotel programs
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.340]   will let you actually opt out of earning points
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.900]   in the hotel program and earn airline points.
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.220]   So you can go into Marriott and say,
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.460]   "I don't wanna earn Marriott points."
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.340]   And pick an airline and earn those points.
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.660]   It's not really a great deal.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.220]   So I pretty much never do that.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.860]   And by pretty much I don't.
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:51.340]   Though, if you were a diehard loyalist to one hotel chain,
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.300]   and you happen to have a stay at one hotel chain
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.380]   where you don't even care about earning points,
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.800]   maybe it would be worth doing.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.360]   But the programs I really like are ones
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.960]   that stack on top of that.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.200]   And so United and Marriott have a partnership that stacks.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.960]   Hyatt and American have a partnership that stacks.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.920]   And Emirates and Marriott have a partnership that stacks.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.760]   So if you're staying at a Hyatt,
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.000]   you can earn some extra AA miles.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   If you're staying at a Marriott,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.440]   you can earn United or Emirates points.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.720]   So those are good options.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.700]   On top of that, there are hotel booking platforms
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.320]   that almost every airline has.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.900]   So JetBlue has a program called Paisley,
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.460]   and you can go to the Paisley website,
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.940]   which I think is just paisley.com,
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.820]   and you can go book hotels.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.940]   And what effectively is happening
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.860]   is they're taking the hotel commissions they earn
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.300]   from that platform and giving you JetBlue points in return.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.940]   So they're not allowed to give you their commission,
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.260]   but they can give you some points.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.700]   And Paisley is cool because it also includes
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.740]   the inventory from VRBO.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.940]   So if you're booking a vacation rental on VRBO,
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.460]   or I guess I'm supposed to say VRBO,
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.020]   you can book it through JetBlue Paisley's site,
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.060]   and then you can actually earn JetBlue points
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.740]   on top of booking that vacation rental.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.980]   Delta has a site called Delta Stays,
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.820]   and Alaska has a site called Alaska Vacations.
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.660]   They're both powered by Expedia.
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.100]   So when you book hotels there,
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.180]   you earn points in their mileage programs.
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.940]   American and Southwest have hotel programs.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.340]   Then also there's a site called Rocket Miles.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.260]   And separate from all the airline programs,
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.860]   it's independent site, but you can earn points
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.700]   in 40 different airline partners.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.060]   So Rocket Miles, for example,
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.340]   has some pretty decent ways to earn points.
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.220]   I just did a really quick search right here.
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.740]   I'm looking in New York City for a couple nights,
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.100]   and I chose that I wanna earn United Miles.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.540]   You can obviously choose Aeroplane, Delta, Southwest.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.940]   And it says, okay, I'm gonna book this hotel stay
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.860]   for two nights, it's $1,400,
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.300]   and I'm gonna earn 15,000 miles for this day.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.300]   So not a bad redemption.
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.140]   If you value United points at, you know,
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.820]   let's call it two cents, that's a $300 back.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:01.140]   $300 out of $1,400 is like a 20% return.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.140]   Now you value it one cent per mile, it's a 10% return,
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.640]   but definitely a decent option.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.500]   So if you're booking a hotel
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.300]   and you wanna earn some extra points,
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.820]   those are great options.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.980]   However, I will say,
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.420]   just like I've said many times in the past,
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.260]   when you book through
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.420]   any of these third-party travel portals,
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.100]   you're often having to deal with the travel portal
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.580]   if anything goes wrong.
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.640]   And in many cases for the hotel chain,
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.140]   you're not gonna be able to earn points on their chain,
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.260]   and you're probably not gonna get your elite benefits
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.460]   in many cases as well.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:35.080]   So I'll flag that if you're staying at a boutique hotel
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.680]   where there's no loyalty program,
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.860]   there's no elite status, it might not matter as much,
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.580]   but if you have a lot of status
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.500]   and you wanna earn points at Marriott,
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.460]   you might not wanna book a Marriott stay
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.660]   through any of these programs.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:51.260]   Also with hotels, if you are booking a event or a meeting,
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.260]   you can often get really, really great earnings.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.500]   So something on the order of,
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.880]   let's call it one to three X points per dollar,
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.300]   if you book a meeting or a wedding or an event at a hotel.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.060]   So definitely make sure you go through
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.400]   whatever meeting program they have to earn that.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.420]   And in some cases on Hyatt and Marriott,
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:17.060]   and I think Accor, you can actually earn elite status
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.900]   through booking events.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.220]   So I think Marriott gives you one elite night credit
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.020]   for every 20 room nights booked,
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.140]   and I think Hyatt gives you two elite night credits
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.380]   for every $5,000 spent.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.020]   Unfortunately, I'm not planning any events,
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.560]   otherwise it would be a great way
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.780]   to really rack up some status and points.
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.100]   On the home rental front, Delta, British Airways,
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.860]   and Qantas have a partnership with Airbnb,
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.920]   so you can earn points on Airbnb bookings
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.100]   through those partnerships.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.860]   I think British Airways also works on Airbnb experiences.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.340]   I mentioned that you can search Vrbo
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.740]   through the JetBlue site.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.420]   They also have a partnership with United
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.740]   that lets you earn points from there.
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.180]   United also has a partnership with Villas of Distinction,
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.100]   which is like a really high-end luxury villa site,
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.500]   but you can earn extra points booking through that.
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.800]   I think you get three miles per dollar spent
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.100]   on luxury villas, which is not a bad return, right?
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.700]   That's somewhere between, depending on how you value it,
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.020]   3% to 6% off.
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.020]   So if you're already booking a luxury villa
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.540]   and you can book it on that site,
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.980]   why not get some extra points
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.540]   in addition to whatever points you get from your credit card?
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.720]   So that's hotels.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.380]   When it comes to car rentals, similar to hotels,
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.980]   the car rental company often says,
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.780]   "Hey, do you wanna earn miles,
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.060]   "or do you wanna earn whatever rewards we have
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.760]   "in our car rental program?"
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.400]   I used to opt for the car rental program rewards
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.940]   because I thought they were a better deal,
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.800]   which I think they are.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.500]   If you rent frequently enough,
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.020]   then you're gonna be able to use them.
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.300]   Hertz's new rules about expiring your points
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.820]   are such that I've actually earned Hertz points
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.380]   every Hertz rental I've had,
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.660]   and never been able to use them
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.140]   'cause they've either expired or been hard to use.
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.820]   And so I probably would have been better off
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.700]   earning miles the whole time.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.100]   You know, for example, on United,
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.380]   if you do that with Avis or Budget,
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.820]   you get 500 to 1,200 miles per rental,
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.580]   depending on your United status.
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.780]   If you're renting from Turo, which is a site
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.380]   kind of like Vrbo and Airbnb, but for car rentals,
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.280]   they do have a partnership with Delta
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.740]   where you're able to earn 2,000 miles on your first trip,
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.140]   and then another 500 miles for every trip after that.
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.160]   So if you're trying to earn some Delta points,
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.580]   or if you're trying to rent on Turo, great option.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.020]   I feel bad because our au pair just rented on Turo,
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:29.980]   and I forgot to tell her,
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.700]   and this could have been an extra 2,000 miles.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.700]   So shame on me.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.060]   If you're taking a cruise,
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.900]   I can't promise it's the best deal.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.320]   So shop around, but almost every single airline
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.020]   has a cruise portal where if you book a cruise
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.500]   through their portal, you earn a bunch of points.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.120]   Similar to hotels, there's kind of a standard
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.160]   industry commission in the cruise world
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.260]   where you can earn, you know,
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.140]   somewhere on the order of 10% as a travel agent.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.720]   So effectively here, the airline's program
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.180]   is acting as the travel agent
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.580]   and giving you some of their commission
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.460]   in the form of points.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.860]   If you take Lyfts and Ubers, on Uber,
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.700]   they have a partnership with Marriott Bonvoy.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.640]   It's not that great.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.580]   It really only works on premium rides.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.140]   So it doesn't work on UberX.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.940]   And it does work on Uber Eats orders if they're over $40.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.000]   And it can get as lucrative as 6X points
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.500]   if you're ordering on Uber Eats while staying at a Marriott.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.380]   So that's one option.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.500]   On Lyft, you actually have to pick,
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.760]   do you wanna partner with Alaska, Delta, Hilton, or Bilt?
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.540]   And then you earn bonus points in those rewards programs
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.400]   anytime you are riding with Lyft.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.720]   Right now, if you link your Hilton account to Lyft,
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.120]   you're gonna get 1,500 bonus points when you take five rides.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.720]   Now, that's in the next six days.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.920]   So by the time this comes out,
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.280]   hopefully there's another promotion,
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.360]   but always good to just check, you know,
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.000]   maybe you've been earning, you know,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.720]   Bilt points for Lyft the entire time,
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.460]   but now there's this great promotion with Hilton,
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.200]   swap it over, earn some Hilton points.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.440]   You can always swap it back.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.240]   Also when traveling, there's a site
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.280]   that I'd never actually been familiar with
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.800]   until I started doing this research called Thanks Again.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.120]   And it's a site where you can basically earn points
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.760]   on a lot of the stuff you do at the airport.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.620]   So parking, shopping, dining at the airport.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.820]   Looks like they have a lot of chains in here.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.920]   Sbarro, Dunkin' Donuts, the CNBC store, Chipotle,
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.520]   Auntie Annie's pretzels.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.360]   And so you sign up there and you're able to earn points
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.980]   anytime you're spending money at the airport,
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.460]   and you can redeem those points for Alaska miles.
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.440]   So another option there.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.140]   Last one on travel is all the activities
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.480]   you're gonna do in a place.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.240]   And so I mentioned you might be able to earn some points
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.840]   on Airbnb experiences.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.120]   If you're trying to book something through Viator,
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.880]   you could actually do that through a Wyndham site
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.640]   or an IHG site.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:44.200]   And so I'm looking right now at Hawaii on the Wyndham site.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.440]   And I assume Hawaii will show up
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.800]   because there are lots of activities to book.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.720]   You end up seeing all the same activities
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.280]   'cause it's powered by Viator,
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.480]   but you earn Wyndham points when you book it.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.160]   You could do the same with IHG.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.360]   There's another site called Get Your Guide,
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.160]   and they have a partnership with Alaska.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.680]   So if you wanna book any of those experiences,
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:06.280]   you can do that and earn Alaska points when you do it.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.600]   And so great option to earn some extra points
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.480]   when you are booking things.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.200]   It's not actually clear how many points you're going to earn.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.440]   I'm looking at this site right now,
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.040]   and it says you earn four miles per dollar spent.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   You get them within two weeks.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.380]   So if you figure four miles on Alaska could be worth,
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.520]   let's call it 2 cents, 8% back, not bad,
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.860]   though obviously compare that to what you could get
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.960]   on a cashback portal.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.560]   And I'm gonna take this example
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.960]   because I've said that reminder three or four times,
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.660]   and I'll just go in here and search for Get Your Guide
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.420]   on Cashback Monitor.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.560]   And we'll see, I can get 7% back on RetailMeNot.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.280]   I can get one mile per dollar on United,
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.560]   and I can get two Rakuten points per dollar.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.920]   So in this particular case, I'd say getting four Alaska miles
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.080]   is probably the best, at least in my opinion.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.320]   Just for fun, I'll go back and look at Ticketmaster.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.720]   Ranges from like half a percent to 5%,
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.480]   but up to 3% on Rakuten.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.600]   So it looks like you can go on Rakuten
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   and get 1% on ticket purchases, 3% on resales.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   So would you rather have one Delta mile or one Amex point?
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.820]   I'd probably go on Amex point.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.480]   So yes, Delta has that Ticketmaster partnership,
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.520]   but I probably wouldn't do that.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.040]   The last platform here is Hyatt.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.000]   They have this Find Experiences program,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.200]   and it's kind of unique.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.240]   I haven't really seen anything like it before
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.000]   where the hotel chain,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.040]   kind of like how Airbnb has experiences,
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.400]   has a whole experience program
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.860]   that's not necessarily linked
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.520]   to having to stay at the hotel.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.000]   So I did a search.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.800]   There's more than 500 experiences around the country.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.660]   You get 10 points per dollar spent,
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.920]   plus additional if you have a credit card from Hyatt.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.400]   Really interesting program.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.440]   In San Francisco,
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.960]   there was a really cool Japanese whiskey tasting.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.920]   There was an Alcatraz tour and a few other things.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.400]   Definitely worth looking around
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.640]   to see if there are any activities here that are good.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.960]   I would say getting 10 Hyatt points per dollar
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.240]   on an experience,
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.800]   I probably value Hyatt points at like 1.5 or more cents.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.560]   That's like 15% cash back.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.080]   So next time I'm looking to book an experience,
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.780]   I'm definitely gonna take a look here.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.220]   Also, it feels a bit more curated.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.240]   When you go to Viator, you go to Get Your Guide,
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.480]   you go to Airbnb Experiences,
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.880]   it can be a little bit overwhelming.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.280]   I can't speak to the quality,
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.440]   but I don't know, it feels a little more curated,
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.880]   which I like.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.680]   And then last one, I forgot to say,
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.120]   when you're traveling,
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.120]   if you have a pet
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.840]   and you need to find someone to watch that pet
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.720]   and you happen to wanna use Rover,
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.720]   Alaska and American each have a partnership with Rover
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.880]   to get one point per dollar
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.400]   or one mile per dollar when using Rover.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.680]   So that's an option.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.320]   Another big category here
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.760]   is kind of on the banking, money, personal finance side.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.220]   First, let's talk about rent.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.280]   If you pay rent,
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.680]   you really should be checking out Built Rewards.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.000]   You can earn points through the rewards program,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.880]   through their card up to 100,000 points a year.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.280]   Highly recommend, built points are fantastic.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.680]   Definitely worth checking out if you are a renter.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.520]   Another option on the finance side
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.960]   is a little bit interesting,
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.440]   but I've been digging in a bit,
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.560]   which is around debit card spend.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.840]   So I said this whole episode is about earning points
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.960]   without spending more money.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.880]   Let me explain.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.560]   So Amex actually has a rewards checking account.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.880]   They say it earns a high interest of 1%,
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.400]   not exciting to me.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.600]   But what is interesting
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.920]   is you earn rewards on debit card purchases.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.040]   And you get one Amex point
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.600]   for every $2 of debit card purchases.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.200]   So not a crazy earning rate,
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.320]   but there are a lot of cases
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.020]   where there are things that you can spend money on
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.060]   with a debit card
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.860]   that you just can't use a credit card for
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.280]   without paying a fee.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.300]   And so if you live somewhere
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.280]   where your property tax can be paid
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.640]   with a debit card for free,
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.260]   or maybe it can be paid for a small fee,
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.000]   sometimes if you look at different places
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.320]   to pay your taxes online,
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.320]   which we'll get to,
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.880]   there's just a small fixed fee to use a debit card
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.920]   where there's a percentage fee to use a credit card.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.520]   Some bills can be paid with a debit card for free,
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.720]   but not with a credit card.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.600]   PayPal BillPay lets you use your debit card
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.480]   to pay a lot of bills in places
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.160]   that otherwise maybe don't take debit cards.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.980]   And then I've heard that there are a lot of credit unions
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.440]   that will let you make auto loan payments
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.480]   and home equity loan payments
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.200]   and even mortgage payments with a debit card.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.640]   So if I had a credit union loan,
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.720]   I would ask this question,
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.760]   which I actually did for our car loan.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.400]   And they said, yes, of course you can use a debit card.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.580]   Turns out it had almost a 3% fee,
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.720]   so it wasn't worth it.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.320]   But if there are a lot of things
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.900]   that you spend money on already,
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.200]   where you're paying through a bank transfer
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.720]   or using a debit card that doesn't earn anything,
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.160]   I think it could be worth checking out
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.600]   this Amex checking account
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.280]   where you can earn Amex points with your debit card.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.000]   Also, there are some bank accounts
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.880]   where when you open up a bank account,
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.640]   they'll let you fund that account with a credit card.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.320]   So if you're opening up an account
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.840]   at a bank or a credit union,
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.960]   you could earn some extra points doing that.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.560]   I did say at the beginning of this episode,
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.280]   I was talking about ways to earn points
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.880]   without spending money.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.680]   And so I guess if you load your bank account
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.800]   with your credit card,
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.020]   you get that money right away
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.500]   so you don't have to actually spend it.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.040]   So that I'll say counts.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.920]   You'll notice I'm not talking about welcome bonuses,
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.080]   category bonuses, 'cause that's spending money.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.640]   And we've talked about that in the past,
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.040]   we'll talk about it in the future.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.320]   It's just not this episode.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.520]   I did mention taxes,
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.040]   and I went a lot deeper on that in episode 164.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.920]   But if you're already paying taxes,
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.460]   which most of us are,
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.880]   there is an opportunity to earn points
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.400]   when paying your taxes.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.340]   Now, that usually comes with a fee
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.520]   when you're using a credit card,
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.640]   though this debit card option is interesting.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.240]   I haven't actually experimented with it.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.200]   But in some cases,
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.520]   you'll earn more rewards than the fee costs.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.740]   And especially if it's a business
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.520]   that you're paying taxes for,
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.440]   the cost of that fee might be a business expense,
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.200]   making it even better deal.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.300]   So if you have a card that earns two points on everything,
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.000]   and you're paying a 1.83% fee,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.580]   which is kind of, I think the lowest it goes,
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.040]   or maybe it's 1.82,
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.800]   it could make sense.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.240]   I'd say that's a little bit more in the buying points
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.080]   for Cheap Camp than earning points for free.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.700]   So let's brush that off.
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.880]   The next one is one that I've used a lot in the past,
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.240]   which is there's a bank called Basque Bank,
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.680]   which has a partnership with American Airlines
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.800]   that lets you earn American miles
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.920]   instead of earning interest on your account.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.760]   Now, funny enough,
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.320]   Basque Bank also has savings accounts that earn interest
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.000]   and checkings accounts that do the same,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   but the mileage account is a mileage savings account
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.680]   that earns two and a half American miles
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.960]   for every $1 you've saved.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.080]   And you also get a bonus of 20,000 miles
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.280]   if you deposit $50,000 and keep it there for six months.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.320]   Now, if you do the math
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.760]   in today's interest rate environment,
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:47.200]   where we're earning 5% on savings or more,
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.160]   I'm not sure how much sense it makes.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.480]   So I ran the quick numbers.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.760]   So if you put your $50,000 in
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.360]   and you leave it there for six months,
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.640]   you'd earn your 20,000 point bonus.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.120]   You'd also earn half of the 125,000 points you'd earn
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.760]   if you put it in there for a year.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:07.760]   So that's 62,500 points for a total of 82,500 points.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.320]   Now, obviously it depends on how you value
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.340]   American Airlines points or miles
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.400]   to decide whether this is worth it.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:20.120]   But I'll say that if you're earning 5% interest
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.160]   on that same amount, it'd be about $1,250.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.720]   So if you value American points at one and a half cents,
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.280]   it's not quite as good a deal.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.640]   If you value them at two cents, it's a better deal.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.700]   The only thing that I didn't factor in here,
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.760]   which I think is relevant,
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.840]   is that you do pay taxes
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.880]   on the interest you earn in your account,
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.640]   and you do pay taxes on the miles you earn.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.480]   However, last I remember,
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.440]   and I could be off on this number,
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.960]   the value of each mile they give you for tax purposes
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.200]   when they send you a 1099,
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.760]   is something like 0.4 cents per mile.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.160]   So if you wanted to look at this math
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.080]   and adjust for the fact that
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.560]   for every penny of interest you earn,
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.080]   you're gonna pay taxes as if it was a penny,
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.680]   but for every mile you earn,
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:09.520]   you're gonna pay taxes on it as if it's 0.42 cents,
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.640]   then you might come out a little bit ahead
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.160]   depending on your tax rate,
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.060]   depending on how you value these points,
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.320]   but it's an interesting option.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.480]   However, when interest rates change, assuming they do,
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.240]   this can get a lot more lucrative.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.200]   And so back when interest rates were almost zero,
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.520]   I was using the BASC account to earn one mile per dollar,
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.800]   which I valued way more
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.680]   than the interest I was getting anywhere else.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.900]   And so if interest rates drop again,
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.440]   this is a place where I'm gonna be looking,
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.060]   especially because American miles are so hard to get.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.120]   American does partner a lot with Citi
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.320]   for a lot of their cards.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.500]   And from time to time, there are Citi bonuses
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.100]   that give you extra American Airlines miles
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.680]   for opening a Citi account.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.920]   There aren't any of those right now, but that's an option.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.640]   And then the last one on this finances side is,
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.520]   if you're shopping for mortgages,
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.160]   there are a couple of partnerships
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.320]   between airlines and mortgage companies.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.760]   So Rocket Mortgage, I think, and Guaranteed Rate
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.460]   have partnerships with United,
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.340]   where if you get a mortgage through them,
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.060]   you actually get 25,000 mileage plus miles
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.980]   if you close that mortgage or refinance.
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.420]   I have looked in the past.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.580]   If the best rate you're getting is at Rocket Mortgage,
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.820]   awesome, go for it, get your 25,000 points,
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.660]   but don't go get a bad mortgage rate
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.860]   to get some extra points.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.500]   So keep that in mind when you're looking at this.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.740]   Better Mortgage has done some of these promotions
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.300]   in the past as well, but I couldn't find one right now.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.280]   Then there was this other bucket of five or six things
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.800]   that I didn't even know where to put them
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.060]   that I'm gonna wrap us up on.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.940]   One is, if you switch energy providers,
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.820]   most airlines have a partnership
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.060]   with two or three energy companies.
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.700]   It seemed like all of the energy companies
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.260]   that you could earn miles from switching to
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:54.420]   are NRG, Reliant, Zoom Energy, and Energy Plus.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.340]   So I'm not too familiar with what it looks like
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.300]   to pick your energy company, because in the Bay Area,
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.060]   it seems like everyone just has PG&E.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.240]   But if you live somewhere where one of these
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.560]   might be a better deal,
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.180]   you can absolutely earn airline miles switching to them.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.080]   For example, if you switch to Reliant,
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.440]   you can earn up to 27,000 miles.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.320]   You get 15,000 when you sign up.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.960]   You get 500 each month for 24 months.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.320]   So definitely worth looking into
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.920]   if you are in the area of any of these energy companies,
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.040]   and obviously you're not gonna have to pay more
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.440]   for your energy to switch.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.360]   Another one that I haven't mentioned here,
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.040]   but I've talked about a lot on the show,
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.720]   is transfer bonuses.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.720]   And I guess the reason I'm saying that is
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.520]   if you have a bunch of points at a credit card company,
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:41.440]   and they're offering you 15, 20, 100% transfer bonus,
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.580]   Bilt just recently did for Virgin on September 1st,
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.560]   you could get 20 to 100% transfer bonus.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.720]   One way to get extra points without having to spend money
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.120]   is to transfer your points during a transfer bonus.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.560]   Now, I don't like the idea of locking your points
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:03.120]   into one airline when they otherwise could have been flexible
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.400]   because airlines are devaluing their miles all the time.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.500]   However, in some cases, I find that it's worth it.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.560]   When Bilt had a 100% transfer bonus to Aeroplan,
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.300]   I transferred a ton of my Bilt points over to Aeroplan
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.480]   because I could turn 100,000 Bilt points
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.240]   into 200,000 Aeroplan.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.840]   And so that to me was absolutely worth it.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.920]   I felt reasonably confident given that Aeroplan
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.800]   I think has more airline partners
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.480]   than any airline in the world,
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.560]   that I would be able to get good value.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.080]   And even if those awards went up 50% in cost,
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.640]   I'd still come out ahead.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.680]   So one way to get more miles and points
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.960]   is to take advantage of transfer bonuses,
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.040]   but I'd just be really careful to make sure
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.880]   you're transferring to a program you understand,
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.120]   you're getting a bonus that is worth the fact
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.480]   that you're giving up some of that flexibility
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.600]   of being able to transfer anywhere.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.920]   So if you had 5 million Amex points,
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.240]   would it make sense to transfer two or 300,000
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.660]   over during a great bonus?
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.500]   Yes.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.600]   If you only had 100,000 Amex points,
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.080]   I probably wouldn't risk it
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.120]   because I would wanna make sure you had the most flexibility.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.440]   However, another way to earn extra Amex points
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.680]   or other credit card points is looking at card referrals.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.640]   So not every card can earn points on referral.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.880]   Not every referral offer is as good as public offers,
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.200]   but from time to time, there are referral offers
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.640]   where if you were to refer someone from one of your cards
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.600]   from Amex or another popular bank,
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.680]   you'd be able to earn extra points
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.400]   if someone signs up for that card.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.760]   I know a lot of people do this between their partners
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.040]   to earn some extra points.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.240]   And two last ones.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.780]   And the first one I thought was obvious,
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.320]   but I met a few people who didn't think about it this way.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.860]   And that is that if you work for a company
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.120]   and you have business expenses,
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:51.820]   you might not be required to use a company credit card
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.560]   if they issue you one.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.260]   So at Google, I remember they issued a G-card to everyone.
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:00.920]   And frankly, they made expensing things a lot easier
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.640]   if you were using your corporate card,
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.000]   but you were also allowed to use your personal card.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.680]   And so if I was gonna go buy a flight to Europe,
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.400]   I'd definitely rather put it on my Amex Platinum
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.160]   and earn five points per dollar
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.440]   than putting it on the G-card and earning nothing.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.160]   So definitely if you work at a company
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.800]   and you have lots of business expenses
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.520]   and you haven't considered finding out
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.360]   whether you can use your personal card,
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.480]   it might be a way to earn a lot of points.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.120]   And I know early on in my career,
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.060]   that's how I was earning a ton of points,
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.920]   especially if I had to stay at a hotel
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.600]   and I could use that hotel's credit card.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.280]   You know, you could be earning, depending on the chain,
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.320]   upwards of 10, 15, 20 points per dollar spent on a hotel.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.360]   And so I would absolutely love to use my card
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.360]   earning those points than the company I work for.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.620]   Obviously this does mean
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.440]   that you are personally loaning your employer money.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.680]   And so I would do this only in the case
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.880]   where you are extremely confident
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.120]   your employer is stable enough to pay you back.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.480]   If you work for a company that doesn't meet that criteria,
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.600]   I would definitely not be willing to risk
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.360]   losing the money to earn the points.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.560]   And then last, I'll talk about donations.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.740]   And so there are a couple options
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:11.600]   for earning points when donating money.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.560]   Now, this isn't a way right now
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.560]   where you can actually earn enough points
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.600]   that it's worth donating if you didn't want to already.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.760]   But if you wanna donate money
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.960]   to the National Cancer Research Foundation
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.720]   and you do it through the United Portal,
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.800]   you get 10 miles per dollar donated.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.960]   And then right now there's a program
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.040]   for donating to Stand Up to Cancer through American
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.160]   that depending on a few circumstances
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.200]   can be 25 or 50 miles per dollar,
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.640]   which is a great amount of miles to get back
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.360]   for a donation you wanna make.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.040]   And obviously I'm all for being charitable,
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.500]   but these two examples are not examples of ones
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.760]   where it's worth it to donate money
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.720]   you don't want to donate just to get the miles.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:58.040]   However, in 2021, there was a absolutely crazy deal
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.720]   where if you donated money through Simply Miles
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.000]   to Conservation International,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   you got a whopping 240 American miles per dollar,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.880]   which effectively brought the price of American miles down
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.960]   to 0.42 cents, which I think mainly by coincidence
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.960]   is the exact same price that they are valued for
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.440]   when you look at Basque Bank earning,
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.700]   but I think that's purely coincidence.
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.940]   Now, this was an incredible opportunity.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.380]   I think it's very easy to make American miles
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.380]   worth at least one cent, if not two cents or more.
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.660]   And so I personally know a handful of people
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.020]   who bought millions and millions of miles.
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.600]   I think if you spent, let's call it $20,000,
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.980]   getting 240 American Airlines points per dollar,
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:44.080]   you would have ended up with 4.8 million American miles.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.700]   Honestly, I wish I could go back in time
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:46.820]   and take advantage of this.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.080]   I don't know how I missed it.
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.300]   I was in the space, this podcast existed,
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.300]   but it happened during the holidays.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.220]   I keep waiting for something crazy like this
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.100]   to happen again, but it hasn't.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.120]   I am ready for the next time it does.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.180]   And I will absolutely let you guys know.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.060]   However, some of these things are really timely.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.620]   So this is a great example of something
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:07.520]   where it might not come out on the podcast fast enough,
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.820]   and it's why you'd wanna be subscribed to the newsletter,
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.380]   because we send the newsletter every week.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.340]   So you can subscribe at allthehacks.com/email.
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:18.000]   Every Saturday, I send an email with all the great deals,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.060]   some of the news and interesting things that are happening,
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.460]   some of my top recommendations from the last week.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.020]   Sometimes they're actually deals that are even more timely.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.140]   They're only live for an hour, a day, a couple days.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.260]   When that happens, I send them to the All The Hacks members
[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.500]   in our member site.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.460]   That's something that I just can't do to the public
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.180]   because I'm not gonna spam tens of thousands of people
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.500]   every time there's a deal.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.820]   But if you're interested in getting those deal alerts
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.740]   anytime they happen, it's usually maybe once
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.820]   every month or two, but sometimes they're really great.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.060]   We'd love to have you in the All The Hacks membership.
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.180]   In addition to that,
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.980]   there's a lot of other stuff we're doing in there.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.220]   We have a bunch of member-only discounts.
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.580]   You get free access to a lot of the products and tools
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.880]   I've built, like my credit card optimizer,
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.640]   and priority access to any events we're doing.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.100]   But the big change that's happened recently
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.580]   that has either already happened
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.020]   and you've seen it in the podcast feed
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.460]   or is about to happen,
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.480]   is that we're gonna start creating member-only content.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.100]   And we're doing that for a couple of reasons.
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.740]   One, there's some content that we just can't talk about
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.260]   to the entire audience of the podcast.
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.340]   And so we're gonna have to do that in a smaller group.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:22.280]   And so that's part of it.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.060]   There's also some AMA content where I do episodes
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.660]   with members where you can ask questions
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.060]   and we do some of those live.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.160]   So that's the All The Hacks membership.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.460]   It's now going to come with this extra podcast feed
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:36.360]   that'll probably have an episode once a month.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.580]   And we'll try to put a preview of those episodes
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:40.780]   out to the main feed so you can get a sense
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.920]   of what's going on to the extent we can.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.960]   So that's all thehacks.com/join if you're interested.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.080]   I think that's it for this week.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.220]   I just want to point out that these deals
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.560]   that we ran through to earn extra points and miles,
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.520]   they're changing all the time.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.000]   So if there's an airline you're looking to earn in,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.200]   definitely go to their partnerships page.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.440]   Definitely subscribe to the newsletter
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.920]   where I'll send out updates as things change as well.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.040]   Hopefully by the end of all this process,
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.000]   you're just racking up tons and tons of points,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.400]   taking awesome vacations.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.300]   If I missed anything, send me an email.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.820]   I'll make sure we update the post for this episode
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.760]   with a list of everything in there.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.160]   So the show notes will have links
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:16.440]   to everything we talked about,
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.880]   and you can get all those at allthehacks.com,
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.200]   which if you notice has also been chrishutchens.com
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.000]   for some compliance reasons,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.600]   but all the links I've ever shared,
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.300]   allthehacks.com/anything will still work
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:29.540]   and will forever work.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.840]   So go check that out.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.680]   Look at the show notes, grab those links,
