[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.700]   If you were at this point to give a kind of a best recommendation in terms of how to reset one's attentional abilities, what are the basic requirements?
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:32.760]   So I think there's a lot there, too. I think you have to be really mindful about directed attention fatigue. So if you're trying to study or you're at work and you're having a really hard time concentrating, I would recommend not just trying to power through.
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:46.540]   If you have the ability and the time to take a break, I recommend that you stop and you take a break. And what kind of break do I recommend you do? I recommend that you go and try to find some nature and walk in nature.
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:01:03.140]   What if you're having a hard time getting into a focused state at all? It's not that you fatigued it that day. You know, so many people that I hear from who listen to the podcast and elsewhere will say, you know, they get up, they did their best to get their sleep.
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.200]   They get their morning sunlight, they hydrate, they drink their caffeine, they sit down to their computer and they just can't focus.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:19.120]   And then they start thinking like, do they have brain fog? Do they need a nootropic? You know, all these questions start to arise. What are your thoughts?
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:27.600]   I think in some sense, even though you might be very well slept and very well fed, you could still be in a directed attention fatigue state.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.900]   So I think, yeah, if you can't concentrate right in the beginning of the morning, then you should go for a walk right.
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:41.820]   That should be the first thing you should do. Or if you don't have access to nature, maybe listen to some nature sounds or watch a nature video or something like that.
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.880]   We find that all those things can be beneficial. Even looking out the window to nature can be beneficial. Looking at a picture, you've got a picture of nature here, looking at a picture of nature can be beneficial.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:59.300]   So I would say anytime you're having trouble concentrating, it doesn't matter if it's at the beginning of the day or the end of the day or the middle of the day.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:16.200]   I would recommend that you take some kind of break with nature and it could be simulated nature, like listening to nature sounds, watching a nature video, looking at nature pictures or even better is if you can actually get out and interact with nature.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.120]   Because Steve Kaplan used to also talk about these other elements that might be important for a restorative environment.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.920]   One was that the environment had to have extent, meaning that it had to have enough interesting things to look at.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.060]   Now, it doesn't mean that it has to be Yosemite Valley, which has incredible spatial extent.
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.720]   I mean, it's huge. It's enormous.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:48.040]   But, you know, like near my office at the University of Chicago, we have this Japanese garden, the Garden of the Phoenix.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.340]   It might be only like 100 square meters. It's pretty small.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.900]   But, man, it's still got a lot of extent.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.080]   You know, it's got a walking path. It's got a little waterfall.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.520]   You can see Lake Michigan.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.660]   So that's one element.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.560]   Another thing about the nature is that you want it to be compatible with your goals.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.260]   So what do I mean by that?
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.980]   If you've got a big exam and you haven't studied, I'm not sure going for the walk in nature is going to work.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.020]   You better use that time to study.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.300]   But if you can't concentrate, you know, trying to power through, I don't think it's going to be compatible with your goals.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.340]   I think going in for the nature walk is compatible with your goals.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.660]   So that's another thing that's going to be really important.
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.780]   And the other concept that Steve used to talk about being important is that the environment needs to give you the sense of being away,
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.700]   that you're kind of removed from your current environment, almost like a change of mindset.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.820]   And again, that doesn't mean you have to go really, really far away, but you might want to go to a location that's not at your desk.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.940]   So maybe don't sit at your desk and look at the nature pictures.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.020]   Maybe you want to go somewhere else and look at the nature pictures.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.820]   And this kind of distance, I think, could be helpful.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:16.700]   I don't know if Cal Newport talks about this in his deep work, but, you know, I've heard people talking about in an office, you might want to have like a separate area of your office for deep work.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.720]   And I think this kind of sense of being away is related to that.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.720]   You kind of want to get out of your current state and go into this other environment that might be able to replenish those resources.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.220]   So I'm hearing that there are two sides of the coin.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.300]   One is to designate an area for work that's truly for deep work.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.620]   Yes.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.100]   I followed Cal's recommendation, and now I have an area in my basement, believe it or not.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.920]   And there has never been a phone in that basement.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.560]   There are no phones allowed in that basement.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.900]   That's not a rule.
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.740]   It's not a protocol.
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.500]   It's a policy.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.740]   Right.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.060]   And I remember he talked about in his, he has this library office that he goes to, and I very much agree with that.
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.300]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:02.780]   Now, I do get internet access down there a little bit if I need to look for papers, but I've been turning off Wi-Fi on my computer when I go down there to work.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.960]   And I get more done in three hours down there than I would in three weeks above ground.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.900]   I swear.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.300]   It's a huge effect.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:22.160]   The other side of the coin is this business of getting out into a different environment, and it sounds like these walks or these ventures into nature don't take terribly long.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.320]   How long does one need to do this in order to get the enhancement and focus and working memory?
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.400]   Like, what do the data say?
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:34.460]   I mean, when we did the, our walking study was 50 minutes, but I've seen other studies with as little as 20 minutes.
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.480]   You can get the effects.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.340]   For cognitive enhancement.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.240]   For cognitive enhancement.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.160]   And there's actually been some interesting studies with kids with ADHD.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:52.500]   And they find attention benefits for these kids with ADHD after just a 20-minute walk in nature that actually was similar to, like, a dose of Ritalin.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.380]   So that was pretty incredible.
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.980]   So it doesn't have to be super long.
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:02.020]   And when we were doing the slideshow of nature pictures, that was only for about 10 minutes.
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.400]   So it doesn't have to be a really, really long immersion.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:13.160]   There have been other studies that have suggested, like, overall, you might want to get about two hours a week in nature.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.160]   So it's a really long immersion.
