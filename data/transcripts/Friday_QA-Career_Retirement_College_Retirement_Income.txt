[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.680]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, live Q&A.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.480]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.640]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.920]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.040]   After a long time in the desert with no Friday Q&As, Friday Q&A is back.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.720]   Been traveling and taking some vacation and trying to recover from events the last couple
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.560]   of months, but I'm ready to go.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:51.760]   Got a microphone, got a line full of collars, and here we go.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.080]   If you are new here at Radical Personal Finance, welcome.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.340]   I am glad that you are here.
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.480]   Every Friday that I can arrange the technology to have an internet connection and be in front
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.480]   of a microphone, I record a live Q&A show.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.680]   So this live Q&A show works just like a live radio call-in show.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.120]   I have an open phone line with callers sitting on the line.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.000]   Looks like right now we've got one, two, three, four callers sitting on the line.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.240]   May have some more join here in the next few minutes.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.880]   And you can call in and you can talk about anything that you want to talk about.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.320]   You can ask me questions about anything that's related to your personal situation, any particular
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.320]   questions you have.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.600]   You want to talk about your own financial plan, that's a good topic for conversation.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.840]   If you want to talk about something I've said in the show, ask for clarification, debate
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.240]   with me on something, solicit an opinion, talk about current events, talk about anything
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.240]   in the world.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.160]   It's open line Friday.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.920]   So these shows are limited to patrons of the show.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.660]   That's the way that I limit the access just a little bit, keep it down to a manageable
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.040]   number of four or five or six or seven instead of 40 or 50 or 60 or 70.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.480]   And so if you'd like to join the show as a patron, go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.080]   Just go directly to that link, patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance and you can sign up there to support the
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.920]   show and that will give you access to these Friday Q&A shows.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.960]   I'd love to have you join as a patron of the show and I would love to talk to you next
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   week.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   But for today we go to Greenville, Texas.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.960]   Trey, welcome to the show.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.960]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960]   Hey Joshua, thanks.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.960]   I have a question that's really kind of about balance, I guess, and it's probably a question
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.960]   that's going to be different for each person.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.960]   I wondered if you might have a framework to think through it.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.960]   I'm 28 years old.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.960]   My wife and I have two low six-figure salaries.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   We're both working at a company called Greenville, Texas.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.960]   We're both working at a company called Greenville, Texas.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.960]   We're both working at a company called Greenville, Texas.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.960]   We're both working at a company called Greenville, Texas.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:42.320]   We're both working at a company called Greenville, Texas.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.360]   We just have a really good situation right now where we both like our jobs and I want
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.960]   to keep working, but there's also a lot of things I want to do and would like to have
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   more free time.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.920]   So I just wondered how you balance that for somebody like me who's young and has had some
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.660]   pretty good early success, doesn't want to mess that up, but also wants to enjoy my youngness.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.040]   Do you have children?
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.360]   Not yet, but that's probably coming in the next year or two, board one.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.600]   And do you, what are some of the kinds of things that you feel like you'd really love
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   to do?
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.360]   If you won the lotto and had a couple million bucks sitting in the bank, what are some of
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.400]   the things that are on your list that you think would be really interesting to work
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   on?
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.720]   Well, I would like to be more entrepreneurial and there's nothing about my current situation
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.800]   that's really keeping me from doing that other than in my spare time I like to go and play.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.600]   So for example, right now, I just about 10 minutes ago left out of my small town in Texas,
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.120]   Panhandle, and I'm going to New Mexico on my motorcycle right now for the weekend just
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.120]   by myself.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.800]   So I'd like to do more stuff like that, but more of a longer, slow travel where I could
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.080]   take, you know, bring my wife with me and the dog and just kind of explore more.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.520]   What else?
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.440]   Well, I'd like to spend more time with my friends and family.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.040]   We're all spread out kind of all across the state.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.240]   Texas is a big state.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.840]   Yeah, I like woodworking.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.080]   I've got a lot of hobbies, playing music.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.640]   I'm one of those guys that has broad interests and will probably never master any of those
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.560]   things, but I kind of like bouncing back and forth.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.960]   I've always got something going on.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.880]   Does your wife have ambitions or aspirations outside of her job that she would like to
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.720]   pursue?
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.880]   She's blessed with contentment.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.320]   Don't you really wish for that sometimes?
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   I really do.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.640]   No matter what I'm doing, I always feel like I should be doing something else.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.280]   Yep, understood.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.240]   Well, let's talk it through.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.080]   So as I see it, there's almost nothing wrong.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.800]   There's almost never sitting down and earning money and saving money, especially if you
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.240]   guys can earn a couple hundred thousand dollars a year.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.880]   I don't know how much you're spending a year, but if you're spending a small fraction of
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.880]   that and saving a lot of money, it's hard to find any 35-year-old who would look back
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.920]   and say, "Man, you should just walk away from that."
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.040]   It's hard to find a 45-year-old.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.040]   I would encourage you.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.480]   I don't know how much you open up with your money with other people, but take some personal
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.920]   friends and people that you admire, maybe somebody who's 35, somebody who's 45, somebody
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.920]   who's 55.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.160]   You've got to have relationships of trust to do this, but ask them about some of the
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.320]   things that they appreciate and some of the things that they would miss.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.200]   I would bet that if you were able to talk to a dozen people, I would guess that the
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.120]   majority, the consensus would be if you've got a spot where you can sit in, make a couple
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.560]   hundred thousand dollars a year.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.960]   I don't know how much you guys are spending, but let's say $50,000 a year.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.320]   You can live great on 50 grand if you don't have a bunch of debt, 50, 80 grand, something
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.320]   in that range.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.360]   You could save $100,000 a year.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.880]   I think it's hard to find somebody who would say that you shouldn't do that because what
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.640]   will happen if you'll do that for a few years and get to the point where you've got a half
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.160]   a million dollars in the bank, maybe a million dollars in the bank, and you can do that by
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:21.280]   the time you're in your early 30s, you can do that before you have children.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.160]   As long as you're not stupid, you pretty much for the rest of your life will never have
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:34.240]   to make a decision based on money, which is a very compelling form of financial freedom,
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.040]   to not have to think about money.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.840]   And so it's hard to walk away from something like that.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:49.360]   And the challenge of being 28, you're more mature than, of course, you were at 18, but
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.840]   the challenge of being at 28 is you look around and you think, "Well, I got to go now."
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.040]   And most people who are 35 or 45 or 55 would say, "Bro, a couple of years.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.960]   Keep that up for a couple of years and have a half a million bucks in the bank."
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.840]   And then from then on, everything is simpler.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.440]   And I think that that's a good way to start.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:17.640]   And so I would be very hesitant to recommend to somebody in your situation that you leave
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.640]   that.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.080]   When you have an opportunity to earn as much money as you're earning, when you have an
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.920]   opportunity to save a lot of money, when you have an opportunity to live inexpensively
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:33.120]   and stabilize everything, it's hard to suggest walking away from that.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.080]   Now, what are some other mitigating factors though that would be things that you would
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.080]   walk away from it?
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.040]   Well, a big one is going to have to do with what is your overall investment plan and your
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.620]   investment kind of picture.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.960]   It's one thing to be doing what you're doing, working some jobs that take a good amount
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.320]   of time and to be stashing that money with a purpose.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.680]   And that's really something that you're going to need to get pretty quickly as a purpose.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.680]   What am I going to do with this money?
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.240]   All right, I got 150 grand in the bank.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.240]   Great.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.240]   What's this money for?
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.680]   Is this for opening a business?
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.680]   If so, then as soon as you've got the money set aside, then you start working on opening
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.680]   the business.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.160]   Is this for investing in something, investing in stock or investing in real estate or investing
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.680]   in elephant hunting rifles?
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.920]   What am I going to do with the money?
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.120]   And then go for it.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.360]   Let's say that you had a vision, that your plan for wealth is that your family is going
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.680]   to be involved in the automobile business.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.400]   And you've discovered that your dream would be to build a chain of successful automobile
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.120]   dealerships in Texas.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.480]   Well, you could do that and you could make a lot of money.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.480]   Or maybe you're riding a motorcycle.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.080]   So let's use a Harley Davidson, right?
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.960]   Your dream is to open a Harley Davidson franchise.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.640]   Well, you could do that and that could be a very profitable business, could be a wonderful
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.720]   lifestyle business that you might really enjoy.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.760]   But you should pursue it as soon as you have the money.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.000]   And so then you would have a goal for the money.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.920]   Now another example would be, let's say that you want to become an independent real estate
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.920]   investor.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.940]   And so you do the math and you say, "You know what?
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.160]   If we had six or seven houses that we owned and if they were paid off, that would be enough
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.320]   money to make us financially free."
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.840]   And so now you have a clear goal that over the next five years, we're going to buy five
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   houses.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.560]   And so you need $50,000 a piece for down payments.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.920]   Now you've got a clear goal and you can see how you could build it quickly.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.360]   That gives you a sense of purpose when you're in that working period of just earning money
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.840]   and saving it.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.380]   If you have a clear purpose that is driving you, then it doesn't feel like you're spinning
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.380]   your wheels.
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.520]   Where you do start to feel like you're spinning your wheels is if you just say, "These jobs
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.440]   are okay, but they're not a big dream of ours.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.000]   They're okay.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.120]   And we've got to wait until we have $2.5 million in the bank and then we're going to be financially
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.120]   independent and we're going to quit."
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.640]   That's a harder, much longer road to stick with.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.440]   And so I would encourage you to lay out some clear goals, especially goals that include
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.480]   the money.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.520]   Now what are some other extenuating factors?
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.240]   If you do have a clear entrepreneurial vision of something that you want to do, I would
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.460]   encourage you to do it sooner rather than later.
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:12.600]   There are a lot of businesses that you can build that are very, very profitable, very,
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:19.520]   very rewarding, very much worth your doing, but they take a lot of energy in the beginning.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.080]   And sometimes they take money, sometimes they don't, but they usually take a lot of energy
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.080]   in the beginning.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:30.240]   And it's going to be easier for you to invest that energy when you've got more fire in the
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.740]   belly in your late 20s, early 30s, than it will be in your late 30s, early 40s.
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.600]   It seems like many people start to lose some of that fire in the belly.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.680]   It becomes harder to do the long hours necessary, and it's especially complicated when it comes
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.200]   to children.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.120]   So what I would start with is an analysis of what do I think is going to be the best
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.120]   lifestyle for me?
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.440]   Do I think that entrepreneurship is going to be the best lifestyle for me?
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.120]   Do I think that employment is going to be the best lifestyle for me?
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:05.520]   And then really invest myself until, especially at this age where you're relatively unencumbered,
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.840]   into maximizing all of the opportunities.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.040]   With what you said, wanting to do a little travel, wanting to spend time with family,
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.480]   et cetera, I don't see why you can't do that and keep a job and start a business on the
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.480]   side.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:22.640]   And I think that if you really invest at this time, your 35-year-old self will thank you.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.000]   Your 45-year-old self will thank you.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.080]   I know that there's a sense in which many people would say, "Well, you only live once.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.060]   You got to take advantage of it."
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.160]   I don't buy it so much.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.040]   I've never regretted how hard I've worked when I was younger.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.840]   And I think that if you were to go out and talk to people, I think a lot of people would
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:48.040]   say, "Bro, if you're making some money, buckle down to it and make and save as much as you
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.040]   can.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.840]   It's hard to see why you would regret that at this phase of life."
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:57.360]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:05.000]   We've got some sort of intermediate term goals and it doesn't take a lot of money.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.880]   I've been shopping for a mobile home park because I flipped a house once.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.960]   I've always been interested in real estate and took that money and didn't really make
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.960]   money, but I learned a lot.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.280]   So that's part of that money that we've got set aside now.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:24.240]   But I've been shopping for multifamily real estate for a while and have in the last 18
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.600]   months or so really decided that a mobile home park is what I want to own.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.760]   And I've put in a couple of offers this year already.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.720]   I haven't gotten one yet, but I hear what you're saying.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:41.480]   I think that just a few hundred thousand dollars more really probably opens up a lot.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.720]   What I would say is if you're feeling dissatisfied with your job, the great thing is you make
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   a hundred thousand dollars.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.120]   The great thing is also you can make a hundred something thousand dollars working in something
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.220]   that's closer to the direction you might want to go.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.760]   So maybe you're working in the medical device field, but you're like, "This is not for me."
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.840]   Well, go get a job in the real estate field.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.600]   Go become a real estate developer.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.160]   And get yourself a job starting so you start to get some exposure and put yourself in a
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:14.480]   position where you can make a six-figure salary as a real estate developer while also simultaneously
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.160]   getting yourself closer to your area of investment focus.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.700]   The other thing I would just encourage you not to waste is this time period where it's
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:31.720]   easy for you to maintain a dual income household without any or at least without many negative
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   effects.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.480]   If your wife is well employed and she's got a hundred thousand dollar income and she's
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:42.320]   content in her job, that gives you the ability to pivot to almost anything else without thinking
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.040]   much about the money, assuming that you can live on a hundred thousand dollars or less.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.080]   So that's a freedom that you don't have at another phase of life.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.320]   And so if you start having children and if she's home taking care of the children, that
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.640]   freedom goes right out the window and it's much more difficult to make those career moves.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.220]   And so if you're interested in real estate, if you have an interest in getting closer
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.960]   to it and you feel like your current job is kind of a dead end, then I would do all of
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.520]   the above at the same time.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.300]   So I would say my goal is to become an investor in mobile home parks.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.480]   So how can I get a job that's going to get me closer to that and how can I get a job
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.240]   that's going to make me more money?
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.440]   And so if you're making a hundred thousand dollars now, what could I do that would move
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:28.220]   me into the real estate business with a hundred and fifty thousand dollar salary or more but
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:34.780]   also allow me to get closer to the business so I can start to make more connections, etc.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.260]   And so I would try to maximize all of those.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:42.540]   The point is there are times in life where you have things pretty easy and you're in
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.000]   one of those times right now.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.740]   You have basically unlimited time.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.720]   You have basically almost unlimited financial freedom, right?
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.740]   Not a lot you can't buy if you wanted to buy it.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.560]   You don't have the ability to live on your investments for the rest of your life, but
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.820]   that's about it.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.980]   And so you want to maximize those times.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.320]   And I got to imagine that most of my listeners who are a little older are kind of nodding
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.320]   their head.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.860]   I think there's a phrase that we have in English, "Youth is wasted on the young."
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:16.160]   And I look back and I just think about, "Man, why did I not do more when I was young?
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.440]   Why did I not read more?
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.720]   Why did I not learn more?
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.420]   Why did I not try more jobs?
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.320]   Why did I not try more businesses?
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.260]   Why did I waste so much time?"
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.040]   And I was more productive than almost anybody that I know.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.220]   But still I look back and I just think, "I wasted so much time."
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:35.380]   And so what you want to do is not waste this time because it's precious to have the freedom
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:36.660]   that you have.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:41.720]   And if you and your wife continue to pursue the path of having children, you go into a
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.660]   period, about a 20-year period, where you're much more constrained.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.860]   Now it's not a bad thing.
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.660]   It's a wonderful constraint, right?
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.860]   I don't regret it a bit.
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:56.180]   But it is a constraint and it's a lot easier to manage that time period if you got more
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.980]   money in the bank, more investments, more businesses that you built during your 20s.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.980]   Fair enough?
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:01.980]   Fair enough.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.980]   I appreciate it.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.980]   My pleasure.
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.980]   Thank you for calling in, Trey.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.980]   All right, we'll go to Chuck in Georgia.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:06.980]   Chuck, welcome to the show.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:07.980]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:08.980]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:09.980]   Good evening or good day or whatever.
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:16.180]   I don't know where you're at, so I'm just going to keep it simple.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:24.140]   Hey, unlike your other caller, I'm looking forward towards retirement.
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:29.100]   I see that light coming closer and closer as you age a little bit, right?
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.940]   So it's easier to save the money when you're younger and all that kind of stuff.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:39.060]   But then when you start contemplating that you have to actually spend the money without
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.980]   an income, then you're thinking about how do you conserve the money, right?
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:51.340]   So one of the things that I came across was by a guy named Nelson Nash with a whole life
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.380]   infinite banking and all that kind of stuff.
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:17:01.860]   And I knew that you had some information because you were working in the insurance industry.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.300]   And I'll explain.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:09.220]   My understanding of it is that you basically create a contract, you have an account, and
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.660]   you treat it like a passbook savings account, and you're basically paying yourself back
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.980]   perpetually.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:22.180]   So I didn't know what your take on it was and what's the actual pluses and minuses of
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.020]   this strategy or I don't know.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.020]   How old are you?
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.540]   I'm going to be 52.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:35.340]   And when you're thinking about, Nelson would call it an infinite banking concept.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.780]   When you're thinking about applying the infinite banking or bank on yourself as another kind
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.900]   of brand name of the business concept, are you thinking about doing this on yourself,
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.300]   buying a bunch of whole life policies for you and then using them as a form of retirement
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.460]   income?
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:55.340]   More of a preservation and also to maybe possibly extend onto the rest of my family.
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:00.900]   How much money do you have saved?
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.580]   Probably about, well, it depends.
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.820]   You mean just strictly in retirement or in cash or what?
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.820]   Total net worth.
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.220]   We'll get to the distribution in just a minute.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:16.780]   Total net, I'm guessing probably about 800.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.180]   And how much of that is in retirement accounts?
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.180]   About 500.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.180]   Well, it depends.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.500]   It varies with the stock market.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:29.060]   And then about $300,000 in cash savings accounts or other investments or is that in home equity?
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.060]   How much of that?
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.060]   What's the 300?
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.060]   Where's the other $300?
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.060]   That's towards rentals.
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.060]   Okay.
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.420]   Rentals and equity.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.660]   So how much is your annual income?
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.860]   I'd rather not say.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.300]   So here's basically my approach.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.780]   I'm kind of a middle ground person.
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:55.580]   I believe that that's the accurate place to be is a middle ground person.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:01.920]   Meaning that I'm not entirely opposed to whole life insurance, which is what the infinite
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.860]   banking concept is built on.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.660]   It's built on overfunded cash value life insurance policies, whole life insurance policies.
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.500]   I'm not an anti whole life insurance person.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.580]   I own whole life insurance.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.700]   I like whole life insurance.
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.300]   I plan to buy more whole life insurance in the future.
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.780]   I believe that it's an extremely useful financial product.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.820]   So I'm not entirely opposed to it.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:31.420]   However, I think that those who are frustrated by whole life insurance are often right.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.260]   From my experience as one who formerly sold life insurance, including whole life insurance,
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.460]   it's often oversold.
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:50.060]   And because it's such a complex financial product, it's very easy to misunderstand and
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.540]   to overstate.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:57.140]   And the biggest problem that you face as a consumer, not being a life insurance agent,
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.620]   is that you don't know what you don't know.
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.940]   And so you might think that you understand with anything.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.020]   The power comes in being able to ask the right questions.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.980]   And so that's where an expert comes in.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.820]   An expert knows the right questions to ask.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:18.220]   So specifically with regard to you, if you said, "Joshua, I have some whole life insurance
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.860]   that I bought when I was younger," great.
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.060]   Go for it.
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:27.580]   If you said that, "I have a ton of money and I want to put some money into a whole life
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.140]   insurance policy," fine.
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.660]   That's also fine.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.380]   But at your level of net worth, and unless you're – I'm going to assume that you're
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.620]   making something like a six-figure income, but unless it's multi, multi-six figures,
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:44.740]   at your age and at your level of net worth, I don't see much of a role at all for permanent
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.740]   life insurance.
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.340]   Where you need to start – are you employed or self-employed?
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.340]   I'm employed.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.340]   Okay.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.500]   So if you're employed, where you need to start is with the qualified plans that are
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.820]   available to you.
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.500]   You want to start with your 401(k)s and your IRAs.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.620]   And so max those things out.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:07.300]   Those – assuming any kind of normal performance in stock market returns, assuming that we're
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.700]   not in a catastrophic, you know, Mad Max zombie apocalypse scenario, which is exceedingly
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.940]   unlikely, then you're better off starting with your 401(k)s.
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.020]   And so you want to max your 401(k)s out.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.220]   You don't want to start putting lots and lots of money into life insurance.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.300]   You want to max your 401(k)s out.
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.980]   In addition, you don't want to take any money out of your 401(k)s.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.740]   The money that's in your 401(k)s is far superior from a tax perspective than the money
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:36.540]   that you would put into some kind of infinite banking life insurance policy.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.220]   So you keep the money in the 401(k)s.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.940]   That takes care of half a million dollars of your $800,000 net worth.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:46.020]   That leaves us with $300,000, but you said that money is invested in rentals.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:52.100]   The rentals, assuming reasonable performance on your part as an investor, the rentals are
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.420]   a far superior asset for you than life insurance.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.900]   The rentals are leverageable, very easily and safely leverageable.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.460]   The rentals have the potential generally for a much higher return than you would get with
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:12.380]   a life insurance policy because of your ability to kind of mix the business side and the pure
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.380]   investment side into the mix.
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.980]   And it's just going to be a better all-around investment for you with more opportunities.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:23.700]   And so that's going to take care of assuming that 200 of the 300 is invested in rentals
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.580]   and maybe you got $100,000 in cash.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:30.540]   I don't see the place in your scenario for a whole life insurance policy.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.100]   I'm not opposed to it in all scenarios, but if you were younger, if you had more money
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:39.740]   or if you were making more money and we had more excess cash flow, those would be signs
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.180]   where I'd say, "Okay, maybe some of it could go into whole life insurance."
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:48.820]   But the problem, biggest problem of whole life insurance policies are that you got to
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.620]   put money into them when you're young based upon the mortality tables.
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:59.260]   If you start a policy at 52, the numbers do not work until you're in your 80s and 90s.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.780]   That's different than if you start one in your 40s or 30s.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.120]   The numbers work a lot better the younger you are because it's life insurance.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.300]   Other big thing is the expenses.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.460]   All of the expenses come out in the early period, which makes them dramatically underperformed.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.940]   So you need a very long time horizon on a policy.
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.380]   And then number three is you're going to have mediocre performance.
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:23.300]   It's going to model more what you would get in a fixed income portfolio than in any kind
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.740]   of more aggressive portfolio.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.700]   And at 52 with an $800,000 net worth, you don't need to be investing in fixed income.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.940]   You don't need safety and stability at this point in time.
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.380]   You need opportunity.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:37.020]   And so if there's something that you're uncomfortable about, let's say you're uncomfortable with
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.020]   the stock market.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.020]   Well, fine.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.020]   That's a separate question.
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.020]   But I still wouldn't go to life insurance.
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.460]   I would go to another asset class.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.300]   Or let's say you're uncomfortable with real estate.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.300]   Fine.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.980]   There are lots of things you can invest in.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:54.940]   Life insurance locks you into a stable return, but it's generally going to be a return more
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.740]   analogous to fixed income.
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.000]   And you don't need that right now as I see it.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.500]   So it's more like just like an annuity kind of like when people had their pensions, they
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.140]   were actually annuities.
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.140]   And you just get a fixed income.
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.840]   That's kind of, I don't know, boring.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.980]   So when you buy a life insurance policy, quick explanation.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.460]   When you buy a life insurance policy, you have two options.
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:24.520]   You can either invest into the, buy a policy that's value is driven from the company's
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.020]   general portfolio.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.320]   And so usually when we use the term whole life insurance, that's usually what we are
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.980]   referring to is it's built on the company's general account.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.700]   So let's say the company has $150 billion and they're investing this $150 billion.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.300]   This is the money that they're depending on to pay claims with.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.100]   That's called their general account.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:50.620]   Well, because the life insurance company's investment managers have the legal and moral
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.860]   obligation to manage that portfolio for stability.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:59.480]   What they've done is they've taken an actuarial expectation of their policyholders expected
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.180]   dates of death and they've modeled the returns of that portfolio so that it makes sure that
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.700]   they can always pay out death claims because the number one job of a life insurance company
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.900]   is not to build cash values, but to pay death claims.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.180]   They've got to have money to pay death claims.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.780]   And so they invest that money in a more stable way.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:22.100]   The vast majority of it is usually invested into fixed income investments.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.100]   Could be national debt, US treasuries.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:31.940]   It could also be corporate treasuries, AAA corporate bonds, things like that.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.820]   Then what they do is they usually play on the edges with some other types of investments
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.820]   where they think they have a competitive advantage.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:42.420]   A big one that life insurance companies rely on is large commercial real estate investments.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.460]   Maybe there's a local real estate developer who's going to come along and who is going
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:53.500]   to come and build a mall in your local area and they need a $250 million mortgage.
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.600]   Well, a natural fit for that is a life insurance company.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:01.100]   Life insurance companies love to buy malls and write mortgages on malls and buy skyscrapers
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.700]   and things like that.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.900]   But those mortgages are just around the edge.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.060]   They still got to make sure they match the portfolio to fixed income.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:15.140]   Now they also maybe have a small stock portfolio or a small private equity team, things like
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.940]   that that they're working with.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.060]   But it's smaller because they have to pay death claims.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.700]   And so what that means is if you're going to compare your returns in that portfolio
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:31.260]   in the company's general account, you would generally compare that not to the S&P 500.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.940]   You compare it to a fixed income portfolio because that's what it is functionally.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.500]   It's a fixed income portfolio with a little bit of real estate, with a little bit of private
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.340]   equity, maybe with a few stocks on the edge.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:48.180]   Now that's investing into any kind of general account portfolio investment, a whole life
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.660]   insurance policy, something that's invested in the company's general account.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:59.180]   Now the other side is you can purchase a life insurance policy that has some form of variable
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.180]   account.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.580]   So you can, this is called a variable account or a sub account.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.740]   And so the way this works is let's say you go to the life insurance company and you say,
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.540]   "I don't want your fixed income portfolio.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.260]   What I want is a stock portfolio.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:17.740]   And with my stock portfolio, I really want to be able to invest in mutual funds.
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.780]   But can I do that inside of a life insurance policy?"
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.060]   The answer is yes.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:28.380]   You can buy a variable whole life insurance policy or a variable universal life insurance
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.940]   policy.
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.420]   All of these are possible for you.
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.980]   And then your money is segregated into a separate account.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.980]   And when you segregate the money to a separate account, you become responsible for the returns.
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.460]   Problem is this, what can you invest the money into?
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:47.740]   Well, unless you've got tens of millions of dollars and you can set up your own life insurance
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:54.860]   company to run your own offshore life insurance policy with a fund manager managing it just
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.660]   for you, which you can do, but you don't have enough money to do that, then you're basically
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.520]   stuck investing in mutual funds.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:09.300]   So what you do is you take mainstream mutual funds and then you add a life insurance policy
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.940]   on top of them and you own those mainstream mutual funds.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.340]   Problem is it's an expensive way to do it.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:18.020]   You've got the expenses of the funds and now you've got the expenses of the life insurance
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:23.460]   policy and now you have a less favorable tax situation because the tax situation in your
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:28.940]   401(k) is much more favorable for your mutual fund portfolio than it would be in the life
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:29.980]   insurance policy.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:35.300]   Because what you do is if you own stocks inside of a life insurance policy, you take a capital
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:40.420]   gain asset that could be deferred inside of a 401(k) and a 401(k) would still be an ordinary
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:47.300]   income asset or it could be owned as a capital gain asset, which is superior, and you transform
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.300]   this capital gain asset into an ordinary income asset.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.900]   And that's where life insurance is very unfavorable.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:57.620]   Because the values in the policy grow and if you take them out, not in the form of a
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:02.060]   return of premium and not in the form of a policy loan, but you actually take a distribution,
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.140]   now you have income tax as ordinary income.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.380]   And so it just doesn't work in your scenario.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.220]   All of the facts of your situation are wrong is the summary.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.220]   Okay.
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:16.820]   Well, I appreciate your input there because like you said, you don't know what you don't
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.980]   know and I don't know too much about insurance.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:25.540]   I know how to buy stocks and REITs and all that fun stuff, but I'm just looking at my
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:30.940]   options as I'm closing in on a traditional type retirement.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:37.300]   So what I would recommend you start with is start with a business or job or form of income
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.380]   that you won't want to retire from.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:43.540]   That's always your most powerful solution that you want to focus on first is can I have
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:48.860]   a job or a business or a form of income that I'm not going to want to retire from?
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:53.180]   And you can do that at 52 years old, you can completely transform your life and you can
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.660]   build any kind of business that you wouldn't want to retire from.
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.780]   You want to travel the world, get a job that either pays you to travel the world or build
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.600]   a business that allows you to travel the world.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.260]   Have something that you don't have to quit, have something, build something that you're
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:10.540]   going to be excited to do when you're 80 years old and 90 years old and 100 years old.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.940]   So start with that because that doesn't require a lot of money.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:18.660]   Then back that up with an investment portfolio that is going to make you financially independent
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.940]   much more quickly and it's not going to be life insurance.
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:24.540]   If real estate is good to you, it might be real estate.
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.620]   If you have some other kind of thing that you like to invest in, there are many other
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.000]   things possible.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.700]   But start with that low hanging fruit and then if in time you decide if you need life
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.100]   insurance, buy term life insurance.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:39.540]   At 52 years old, you can buy very inexpensively level term insurance which is what you should
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:44.140]   be buying at 52, 10 year policies, 15 year policies maybe if you still have obligations
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.040]   to your family that you can't meet.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.020]   And then if at some point in time you want to own a small whole life insurance policy
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.780]   for some reason, that's fine.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.980]   As a burial policy or part of your estate plan, that's fine.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:00.340]   But that should not be a high priority for you at this stage in your financial plan.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.340]   Okay.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:06.100]   I think you hit all the nails with the head of the hammer there.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.100]   Good.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:12.140]   So yeah, I appreciate your time there and it's kind of funny because your previous caller
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.980]   was on one end of the spectrum, I'm on the other.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.640]   Was I right in my advice to him from your 52 years old?
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.640]   From my 52 years old, yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:27.600]   The more you could plug away when you're younger, you build the momentum when you're older.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.560]   And I was already thinking your advice anyway where I was like, "Hey, well maybe I need
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.560]   a different career."
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.840]   And I planned when I was in my 20s to say, "Hey, I'll change careers at 50."
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:41.280]   But I just haven't, kids happen and I haven't really decided what I want to do when I grow
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.280]   up.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:48.180]   I would tell you, I mean your most fruitful area of thinking and hard work right now is
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.140]   going to be with regard to your career.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.140]   At 52 years old, you're young enough that you're not facing a lot of discrimination
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.140]   in the marketplace.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.900]   That'll change when you're 62, right?
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.380]   In 10 more years, you start to go and apply for another job, you're going to start to
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:04.020]   face a much more significant age discrimination.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.460]   It's tough for 60-year-olds and 70-year-olds in the marketplace.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.960]   But at 50, you're still young enough that you're not facing much of that.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.680]   So what you need to do, what I would encourage you to think about is number one, think about
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.460]   – and we don't have time to go into your career right now – but think about your
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:25.780]   career and make sure you're in a career where your age will be an asset, not a liability.
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:30.780]   So if you are a professional chairman of the board, right?
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:34.320]   Your job consists of being on the boards of publicly traded companies.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.280]   Your age is not a liability.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.880]   Your age because you need wisdom, right?
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.020]   You need insight.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.880]   And that wisdom and insight often comes with age.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:51.560]   If you are a senior architect over a large firm or you're a senior trial lawyer who
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:56.240]   has junior attorneys who are doing most of the day-to-day work but your brilliant legal
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.840]   mind can be applied, the age is not a bad thing.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.120]   You can do that work when you're 85 years old.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.960]   You're not just limited by that.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:09.440]   On the other hand, if you are engaged in something that's dependent upon your physical body,
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:14.920]   you're a carpenter or you're a tile setter, you're a grave digger, well, that kind of
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.840]   work gets really hard to do when you get older.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:21.120]   So you need to look at your career and say, "Am I going to be able to do this as I get
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.120]   older?"
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.820]   And if not, you need to adjust.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:29.600]   Number two, you need to develop for yourself a reputation that will support you as you
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.240]   face increasing levels of age discrimination.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.200]   What you want to make sure is you never get yourself in the situation where you're going
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.120]   in and applying for a job or you're trying to keep your job and they're looking down
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.760]   and saying, "This dude is 60-something years old and we got another guy over here that's
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.080]   40 years old, has all the same qualifications.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.840]   Why would we not hire the 40-year-old guy who at least has some chance of staying with
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.360]   us for 20 years and we could probably get cheaper than the 60-year-old guy?"
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.640]   And so you've got to transform yourself if you're not already.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.560]   Again, if you've already done this stuff, great, but you've got to transform yourself
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:07.500]   from a commodity in the marketplace that gets more rusty as you get older to an extremely
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.360]   valuable gem that's getting shinier and brighter as you get older.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.920]   So you've got to build a brand somehow, an appropriate way to your career where you become
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.680]   more sought after as you get older.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.240]   Third thing to consider is you want to make sure that you don't put yourself in a situation
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.280]   where you're anxious to get out of your job and anxious to get out of your career because
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:30.460]   at 52 years old, you have almost no friends that are retiring early.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.880]   But if you're 67 years old, many of your friends will have retired and then you're sitting
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.080]   down and looking at your job and saying, "Well, I don't want to do this job anymore," and
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.600]   all my friends are sitting out, they're stand-up paddleboarding and they're golfing and they're
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.800]   traveling the world and I'm doing this stupid job and I want to retire.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:50.000]   Rather, what you want is you want to develop a job and a career that gives you an appropriate
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.440]   level of freedom and flexibility so you can go and stand-up paddleboard and you can go
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.800]   and travel to Europe and you can do the stuff that you want to do but within the context
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.720]   of something that's keeping you engaged.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.920]   And I'm convinced that there are tons of these careers out there, things that you would really
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.840]   enjoy doing, things that engage you.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.880]   And it could be as simple as teaching school.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.440]   I've told the story many times about somebody who was so inspirational for me.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.560]   He was a friend of mine, a client of mine when I was a financial advisor.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:23.260]   He was a client of mine who was running a landscaping company but he decided he wanted
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.880]   to close his landscaping company.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.560]   It was profitable but he closed his landscaping company, went back to college at night, he
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:34.120]   and his wife both, they went back to college, finished his college degree and got a job
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:38.680]   as a high school history teacher and he wanted to teach high school history.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:43.120]   And in their situation, it was basically the perfect financial plan because he wanted to
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.560]   teach high school history, he wanted to have the opportunity to impact young people in
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.600]   a close way that a history teacher can do.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:55.160]   He wanted to travel during the summers and so he had three months off to travel every
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.160]   year.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.920]   He had his retirement taken care of with a government pension from the school board
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.520]   and it was the kind of thing where he and his wife had a great lifestyle.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.840]   They would go to school together every morning, go to school at the end of the day.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.000]   He didn't have the – he could leave at 3.30 every day, start at 7.30.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.520]   It was a very agreeable schedule and it was a great plan.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.600]   It's the kind of job that he didn't want to retire from but yet he did still have the
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:20.200]   retirement plan if he needed it because it provided enough benefits that he was excited
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   about it.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:26.040]   So that's at the kind of lower earning side but just to show that you can build a lifestyle
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.640]   that provides you with everything that you need.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.240]   Now if you're an executive, your role may be different.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.960]   So the key is build a career that's going to give you the freedom and the flexibility
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.360]   that you need and that you crave so that when your buddies who do retire from their jobs
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.680]   say let's go to Aspen for the weekend, well, you get on an airplane and go and make sure
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.120]   you have the financial ability to do that.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:49.280]   But you'll have a lot more fun than them because then when they come back from their
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.360]   week in Aspen and they got to sit down and say, "Well, what's on CNN today?"
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.560]   You have the ability to say, "I don't care what's on CNN.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.520]   I'm doing this thing that's important to me.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:02.480]   I'm working on this major issue or I'm building this thing or I'm solving this problem or
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.800]   whatever it is."
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.720]   And so you want to build a career that you're engaged with and there are so many options
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.720]   out there.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:14.720]   But if you do that, it will radically transform your life expectancy because people who are
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:19.240]   engaged with the future and have a vision of the future that's bigger than their past,
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.960]   they live longer and they're happier for that.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.680]   It will also dramatically engage your finances.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.920]   And I'm not being a smart aleck with this.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.920]   I mean it.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.160]   If you compare the financial impact, the legacy that you can – of money that you can – the
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.200]   amount of money you can spend and the amount of money that you can save, the amount of
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.040]   money that you can give, the amount of money you can give to your children, the amount
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.360]   of money that you can invest into something and you add another 15 years of happy work
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:48.920]   life onto your lifespan and you say instead of retiring at 65, I'm going to retire at
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.440]   80, just run the financial calculations.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.280]   That's stunning, the impact.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.040]   And so there are some presuppositions, right?
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.960]   We're assuming that you could build a career that you would be excited about doing at 80.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:04.920]   But I'm convinced that for the majority of people, that should be a primary plan.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.360]   Some people really want to retire.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   Fine.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.360]   You can do it.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.840]   But I think that for the majority of people, if you can build and use your financial stability
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.320]   to move yourself into a phase where your future is bigger than your past and you're excited
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.920]   about the next few decades because of the impact you're going to have, the work you're
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:25.640]   going to have and as your responsibilities as a father fade into the distance and you
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.120]   start to just have more interaction with your grandchildren but it's much more relaxed and
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:35.240]   it's not such the day-to-day pressure, that's the secret to really winning in life and really
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.080]   winning with money in my opinion.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.080]   So consider that.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.080]   Chuck Liddell Thanks a lot there, Josh.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.640]   All right, Chuck, have a great day.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.640]   We move to Talmadge in Utah.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.640]   Talmadge, welcome to the show.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.640]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   Talmadge Hey, Joshua.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.640]   Can you hear me okay?
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.880]   Chuck Liddell Yeah, sounds great.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.880]   Go ahead.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.880]   Talmadge Okay.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:58.560]   So I guess just to give you a little background, 20 years old, graduated high school in 2018
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:03.880]   and I returned recently from a mission trip in Ecuador, had to come home early because
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:09.320]   of COVID-19 and so I have about six months that I wasn't planning on having just before
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   school starts up.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:17.240]   So I found a job through a friend and I've been working in a sales job in California.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.360]   The awesome thing about it is the rent is paid for.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:26.680]   So my own expenses are food and transportation and earning potential is pretty high.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.880]   Just from the two months that I've been here already, I think this summer I can make upwards
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.960]   of $20,000.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:36.720]   But I want to decide how I need to move forward with my education.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.880]   I haven't taken any college classes yet.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:44.680]   And my main question for you is maybe if we could walk through just some of the benefits
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:49.760]   and the drawbacks of moving away from the conventional college experience of just being
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:54.640]   on campus and going to a university versus online, like maybe through a community college,
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.040]   which would be a lot cheaper.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.040]   That's kind of what I'm trying to think about right now.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.720]   Pete Will you be funding your college classes?
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.360]   Talmadge Yes, I will.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.920]   Pete Okay.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.200]   So in a moment I'll give you an episode number and what you want to make sure to do is to
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:17.280]   go back and listen to the show that I did on the specific benefits of college.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.840]   And I'll give you that episode number here in just a second.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:27.640]   But in that previous podcast, which is probably an hour or so long, I talk about the various
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.600]   benefits of college.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.640]   And this is a hard question to answer because there's so many different ways.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   Here it is.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.640]   It's episode 227.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:41.180]   So right down 227, initially released August 10, 2015 called the five benefits of college
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.800]   and radical ways to exploit them.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.640]   And so let me go over those five benefits with about a few minute kind of intro for
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.900]   you and then give you some texture on this.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:56.280]   As I see it, I see five major benefits of college.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.120]   The first benefit is fun.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.200]   College is fun, right?
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.840]   It can be super fun.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:06.760]   About the college environment is, you know, many people, I don't think the most successful
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:11.360]   people but many people if you ask them, what is the most fun time period of your life?
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:16.760]   A lot of people will say college because you have a lot of people your age, many of whom
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:21.200]   are going to share your interests, maybe your perspective, your worldview, some of your
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.840]   life experience.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:27.680]   Many of those people are thrust together in this interesting community environment with
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.240]   many of them have very little responsibility, right?
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.280]   My only job is to go to class for 15 hours a week and study.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.480]   I mean that's an exceedingly tiny workload.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.280]   And so it's a lot of fun.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:44.880]   And you're in an environment where people have no responsibilities, they have no children,
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.180]   they have no jobs.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.520]   And so it's super fun.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.040]   Hey, you want to go to the beach today?
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.040]   Let's do it.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.520]   You want to ditch class today and go skiing?
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.520]   Let's go.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.840]   You want to go to Florida this weekend?
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.840]   Man, I'm ready.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.560]   You know, it's fun.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:02.440]   And then all of the college raunchy living is certainly available.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.040]   And so it's fun.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.040]   That's the first thing.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.040]   It's fun.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.640]   Number two perspective of college is personal growth.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.160]   Second benefit of college is personal growth.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:15.640]   And there are lots of ways that college can be a time of intense personal growth.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.680]   You take classes that maybe you're not accustomed to.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.520]   For some people, they go away from home for the first time and they have to learn how
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.080]   to adult.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.580]   There are lots of benefits of personal growth.
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.480]   Number three is certification.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.600]   The actual acquisition of a certificate that says you have a college degree.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.280]   I think it's valuable, very valuable and important.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.640]   I'm not convinced it's as valuable from an income perspective as many people think, although
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.160]   it is truly still valuable.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:47.400]   If you were to look at the mass market out there and say, how do people, you know, what
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.960]   is the lifetime earnings?
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.520]   It still is the case that people who have a college degree earn more money.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:59.180]   Where I think it is particularly benefit though, a college degree is particularly helpful is
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.880]   during hard times.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:06.960]   And my observation is during times of high unemployment, during times of a weak economy,
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:10.320]   that's where you're really glad you can put on your resume if you're going applying for
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.560]   a job, I got a college degree.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.560]   It's one of those things.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.860]   If you were to go back and look at the data that we have from the Great Recession in 2009,
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:21.720]   you see that the people that were the hit the hardest in that period were people without
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.060]   a college degree.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:27.240]   People with a college degree didn't have that bad of an unemployment rate, but people without
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.800]   a college degree had a really bad unemployment rate.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.760]   And you see a similar thing happening right now in the United States as we're in this
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.640]   current recession.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:44.280]   People who are at the lower levels of the job space, the income space, those are the
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.160]   people who are experiencing just a horrific unemployment rate right now.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:53.360]   Now the pain of that has not yet set in in the United States because of the generous
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.760]   unemployment payments that many of those unemployed people are having.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:02.260]   But if those extra unemployment payments stop, it's going to start to get really severe.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:07.280]   But so certification matters and certification is a benefit of a college degree.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.020]   Number four is education.
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:14.000]   And so I distinguish and disconnect education from certification.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.720]   Certification is a credential, and apologies for the sniffing in your ears, friends, but
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.800]   that's where we are today.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.240]   Education is the knowledge that you gain.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:28.100]   The certification is the piece of paper.
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.560]   So just a simple example, right?
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:36.880]   I'm studying right now for a foreign language exam, and I have zero application for the
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.880]   certification.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.880]   I don't need the certification.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.440]   I'm trying to get a DELE C2 exam in Spanish.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   And so that's my goal is I want to get the certification.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.480]   I have no need whatsoever for the certification.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.280]   I'm not going applying for a job saying, "Hey, look, I'm a C2 Spanish speaker."
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.280]   I'm not doing anything.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.000]   It's just a piece of paper.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.660]   The education is what matters.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:45:03.600]   And so I could be just as good with my grasp of the Spanish language as anybody else, whether
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.860]   I have the certification or not.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:09.840]   But for me, the certification is something that I'm using to provide motivation for
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.600]   my education.
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.880]   And also then it gives me one more piece of paper that if I ever needed it, if I ever
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:21.640]   needed a backup plan, I can say, "Look, I'm a certified C2 Spanish speaker.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.640]   I know what I'm doing."
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:27.620]   And so if I add that to all my other certifications, now I'm distinguished in the marketplace.
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:31.080]   But don't be confused.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:34.500]   There's a big difference between certification and education.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:39.660]   But in the college environment, you can often receive an education, and you can become well
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.280]   educated in the college environment.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.480]   And for some things, there's really no substitute.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.960]   There's really not.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:52.000]   For some things, you've got to be in that college environment, that classroom environment,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.280]   to make sure that you've got the holistic, well-rounded education, but not all.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.780]   And then number five is connections.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.320]   And so the big benefit of college is connections.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:06.020]   Those connections can be social connections, just your social, your sphere of friendships
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.400]   and acquaintances.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.320]   Those connections could be romantic, right?
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:13.920]   The thing that I appreciate the most about my undergraduate college degree is my wife.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.980]   I met her in college.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:19.360]   And that's a normal story, is that many people meet their spouse in college.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.480]   And it's a wonderful benefit.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.760]   And I'm not scared to recommend somebody go to college just for that.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:34.920]   In the United States especially, college is a very important sorting mechanism for people,
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.640]   especially from a spousal perspective.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.160]   And this is traditionally how college in the United States has functioned.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:47.080]   It's functioned as a way of sorting society out, of separating a certain class of person
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:51.220]   out and distinguishing that these are the college folks.
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:56.800]   And what happens is, from a simple connection perspective of just simply propagation of
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   your kind, that's an important thing.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.800]   Because when people are in that environment, it's likely that a man and a woman who are
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.120]   both in this elite college, they're coming from a similar class.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:17.440]   They're coming from similar intellectual experiences, similar intellectual ability, similar points
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.720]   of education, similar worldviews.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.000]   And so those people come together, they marry, and they start to have children.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.480]   Their children naturally will be part of that class.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.560]   Their children naturally be part of that general functioning.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.160]   The children will have a higher IQ because mom and dad have a higher IQ.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.600]   And it just kind of sorts things down.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:46.520]   And so throughout the American history, college has been a very important sorting mechanism
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.720]   in the society.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:56.240]   And then when you think about the effects on just even your family tree, the term that
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:00.120]   a sociologist would use would be homogamy, which has to do with the inner breeding of
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:05.680]   people who have like characteristics, that's one of the most influential things that you
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:11.960]   see in American society right now, is that highly educated, very intelligent people meet
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:12.960]   in college.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.160]   They're from the same social class.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:19.440]   They make a connection, they marry, and then it starts to lead to these different societies
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:25.460]   because of just the homogamous effects of their marriage and of their procreation.
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:28.680]   And so that's a type of connection that's very, very important.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.560]   So access to the dating pool can be helpful.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.520]   And then of course there are career connections.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.600]   There are colleges where you go there exclusively for the career connections.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:44.120]   If you go to an elite level, you know, a Harvard University, Harvard Business School, you can't
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:49.640]   go to Harvard Business School, get accepted to Harvard Business School, do the minimum,
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:55.640]   and then come out and not expect to be offered many, many job offers in the upper level of
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.000]   the corporate environment.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.760]   And many people reflect back on the relationships that they developed in college and those connections
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:07.660]   as being the most influential things for them in their career.
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:12.360]   Now this varies depending on the particular place, but there's a reason why every Supreme
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:18.220]   Court justice in the United States has a law degree from Yale or Harvard, right, or these
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.780]   elite level law schools.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.420]   It's the connections that you build.
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:27.300]   And so those connections are indisputably important.
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.220]   And so what I talk about in that show, that was an overview, but what I talk about in
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:35.860]   those show is the fact that you can gain these benefits from college.
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:38.960]   You can also gain these benefits without college.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:43.640]   And so a lot of the actual application is going to come down to what do you actually
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.780]   want and envision from your life?
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.460]   What career paths are you interested in?
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.580]   What types of work do you want?
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.940]   And what are the colleges that are on your radar?
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:59.740]   There is a world of difference between going to an unknown college versus a name brand
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:00.740]   college.
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:05.300]   Now I'm not convinced the name brand college is still worth it, but if you're going to
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.220]   compare – let's use three ones, okay?
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.180]   What's the name of a community college near where you live now?
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.420]   Salt Lake Community College.
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.260]   Salt Lake Community College.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:24.580]   What's the name of a kind of a mid-tier state school or kind of just a mid-tier college
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:28.740]   there in the Salt Lake area that's not a community college, just kind of an average
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.820]   school where people go to college?
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:32.820]   Utah Valley University.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:33.820]   Okay.
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:35.140]   Utah Valley University.
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:42.460]   So let's use that and let's use Harvard University or Stanford or one of these kind of big name
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:46.260]   brown – sorry, name brand, Brown University.
[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.260]   So let's use Harvard, right?
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:53.660]   That kind of the creme de la creme, the upper class of society.
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.700]   I don't think there's much of a difference between your going to Salt Lake Community
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.580]   College and Utah Valley.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:05.100]   There's just not, unless there's some special career that you're involved in and there's
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:09.100]   a professor at Utah Valley that has connection, that's active in there.
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:10.100]   Doesn't matter, right?
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.300]   Doesn't really matter.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:15.980]   And for that matter, I would say there's not really much of a difference between going
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:21.620]   to Salt Lake Community College versus any random accredited online school where it's
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.500]   just all online.
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:28.900]   But there is a world of difference between going to Utah Valley and going to Harvard
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.260]   in terms of the overall experience.
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.260]   Those are very different experiences.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:40.340]   Now they come with very different price tags, but a lot of the advisability of you're
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:45.060]   choosing one school or another is going to come down to what specific career are you
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:49.620]   interested in or what area of study do you care about.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:53.140]   Those are the things that are going to make a big, big difference in your life.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:56.820]   So go back and listen to episode 227.
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:00.380]   And what I'll tell you is basically this.
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.540]   I'm a little short on time.
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.620]   I welcome you to call back next week and we can talk more details, but I want to take
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:07.780]   the next caller before I run out of time today.
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.200]   But what I want to tell you is this.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:18.940]   If I were in your shoes and I were self-funding college, what I would probably do is first
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.300]   I would have to start with my career.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:28.940]   And let me ask, do you have a burning specific career ambition that drives you at night?
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.020]   No, I honestly don't.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:35.900]   That's kind of what my goal for college is, is to find out what direction I need to take.
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.140]   Fair enough.
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:45.580]   I would not go to an expensive name brand university unless I had a specific driving
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:49.800]   ambition as to why I needed that university.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:54.540]   If my goal in life is to be the next Supreme Court justice that's going to change the world
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:53:00.300]   of Supreme Court law in the United States and that's my career ambition, I'm going to
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:03.300]   go to Harvard Law or Yale Law, no question.
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:07.340]   I'm going to do whatever is necessary to get into that because that's where those people
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.500]   come from.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:15.660]   I can't go to a random third tier law school and expect to actually do that.
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:19.500]   I'm going to go to Harvard or Yale Law and I'm not going to compromise.
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:23.820]   And if I got to go $200,000 in debt, I'm going to go $200,000 in debt because that's my clear
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:25.180]   ambition.
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:29.060]   Lacking that, I'm not going to be an idiot and go into tens of thousands of dollars of
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:31.580]   debt without a specific career ambition.
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.780]   And so here's what I say.
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:37.460]   Number one, if you listen to episode 227, you'll hear me talk about the fact that I
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:42.980]   believe the vast majority of those five benefits of college can also be achieved without college.
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:47.900]   If you're interested in fun, get yourself an apartment where there's lots of other college
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:53.820]   students where they're going to Salt Lake Community College or Utah Valley or wherever.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:57.420]   Get yourself an apartment in the same apartment complex and start working out at the gym and
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:00.980]   you'll meet all the college students and you'll have access to all the social circles without
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:02.340]   the need to go to class every day.
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.020]   There's nothing special about it.
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.540]   You can get invited out to the bar.
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:06.980]   You can go to Florida for the weekend.
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:08.820]   You can go skiing on the weekend.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.460]   All of that stuff happens just with having friends and fun.
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.540]   And frankly, you could probably have more fun because you don't have to show up at class
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:14.700]   at 8 a.m.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.380]   For personal growth, when you're around a college environment, you could take advantage of a
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.500]   lot of the personal growth environments.
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:23.600]   You could audit the classes if you want to.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.900]   You can go and you can go to the student meetings.
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:30.480]   I knew people when I was in college who weren't enrolled at the school, but you would never
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.100]   know that because they were always there and they were always around.
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.820]   They just didn't happen to be enrolled in any classes.
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:39.460]   Even to the point of being on sports teams, there was not the official sports team of
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.420]   the university, but there were some people who would go and would work out with one of
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.620]   the sports teams and whatnot.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:45.620]   Certification.
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:51.220]   Certification of a college degree, I think, is where there's kind of an end run, a runabout.
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:54.700]   And education can happen, but there's plenty of education available, right?
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:55:00.560]   You can take college, you can take Harvard University school classes on iTunes U.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.200]   And so if there's something special about that, you can do it on iTunes U.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:07.080]   And connections, what I talk about on that show is you can build connections today better
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:11.360]   than at any time in history without the need to actually be at the school.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:17.380]   So trying to balance the range of time and cost, what I would do, if you were my son,
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:21.040]   what I would encourage you to do is I would say, "I believe that it's worth it if you
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:25.720]   are cognitively competent, if academics are not a struggle for you, I believe that it's
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:30.760]   important and worth it for you to be able to check the box that, yes, I have a four-year
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.120]   college degree."
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.040]   Four-year college degree, check.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.640]   I did a show on how to immigrate to Canada as a recent example.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:45.160]   Well, it makes a huge difference if you can check a box on your express entry profile
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:50.600]   to Canada to say, "Look, I have a four-year college degree," or, "I have a master's degree."
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:54.160]   But it doesn't matter what university that's from.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.680]   It just matters that you can check the box.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:01.880]   So what I would do is I would use one of the low-cost online schools, and I would do classes
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:07.880]   online, and I would get the fastest, cheapest four-year college degree that I could possibly
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:08.960]   get.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.480]   And depending on your level of cognitive ability, you can get that in probably a year and a
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:17.600]   half of work, a year, two years, something like that, and your total price tag would
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:20.000]   be under $10,000.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.200]   Now I can check the box that I've got a four-year college degree.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.200]   Now what?
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:29.760]   Well, what I would do with any of those schools, if I wanted a name-brand school or if I discovered
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:34.360]   an area of interest that I really wanted to pursue, I would do that for a master's degree.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:41.560]   Because if you say, for example, "Look, I have a degree from Utah Valley College, but
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:47.440]   I have a Harvard MBA," no one thinks about the fact that you have Utah Valley.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.720]   They just think about the fact that you have a Harvard MBA.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.720]   This is why the community college strategy is so powerful.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.900]   If you go to community college for two years, and then you go to Utah Valley, nobody looks
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:58.880]   down and says, "Oh, you went to Salt Lake Community College."
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.200]   They look down and say, "You went to Utah Valley."
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.640]   They just acknowledge the fact that it all builds.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:08.320]   And so I would get a lot of the low-end classes done just as quickly and fast as possible.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.720]   I would go ahead and just do a four-year college degree.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:17.160]   Now while I'm doing that, I would be really investing deeply in my education, and I don't
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:21.960]   believe that going to college is in any way an efficient way to figure out what you want
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.000]   to do in life.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:31.780]   A $15 book, a biography of a famous person, a book about a certain subject, a career book
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:36.820]   is a whole lot cheaper than enrolling in some class you got to go to three hours a week
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.760]   that you may or may not ever need.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.240]   And so I would dedicate myself to reading.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:43.320]   I would dedicate myself to career profiles.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:45.600]   I would dedicate myself to exposure.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:47.840]   I would spend time in online communities.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:52.560]   I would do things like you're doing right now, calling me, chatting every week, "Hey,
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.040]   here's the things I'm thinking about."
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:58.680]   I would dedicate myself to these things until I figure out a specific area of interest.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.160]   And then once you've figured out that specific area of interest, go from there.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.040]   If you just want money and you're doing well in sales, go with it.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:08.320]   You don't just get the college degree at night, so you've kind of covered that certification
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.320]   need, but do sales.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:14.400]   And you can make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in sales without a college
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.400]   degree.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:19.960]   You can have the college degree sometimes just to get the job, but you don't need to
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:24.880]   go and spend waste tens and tens of hours in a college classroom is the point.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:29.120]   So it's a complex answer because it's a complex issue.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:36.520]   It's not either or, but I would not, if you were my son, I would encourage you get a degree,
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.360]   do an online school where you can do it all at night, do it on your schedule, get it done,
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.520]   year and a half, two years, you should be able to finish that bachelor's degree under
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.800]   10 grand.
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:49.200]   Do that while you're working a full-time job, live somewhere with a fun environment
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.360]   around people that inspire you.
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:55.120]   And then while you're doing that, educate yourself in the areas where you might want
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.120]   to go.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:59:00.360]   And if at some point the college degree seems like a really important piece of that, then
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:05.320]   go ahead and go to an expensive name brand school if it's really a crucial part of your
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.320]   career plans.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:07.320]   >>Toby: Okay.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:10.200]   Yeah, that definitely makes a lot of sense.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.600]   And thanks for helping me think through that.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:14.200]   Kind of a crazy time, lots of decisions to make, but...
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.200]   >>Joshua: It is.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.200]   >>Toby: Thank you so much.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.200]   >>Joshua: Cool.
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.200]   My pleasure.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.200]   All right.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.200]   For our last call of the day, we go back to Texas.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.200]   Welcome to the show.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.200]   How can I serve you today?
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.200]   >>Joshua: Hi, Josh.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:28.440]   I've been taking your advice for a couple of years now and implementing that in different
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:29.440]   ways.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.440]   Appreciate all you do.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.440]   >>Toby: Thank you.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:39.840]   >>Joshua: My question today is I'm working on helping my dad who is 79, retired, and
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:43.040]   has a portfolio with some...
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:49.520]   He's got about a half a million dollars right now in some municipal bond funds, and he's
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:56.800]   got about another $200,000 to $300,000 kind of in cash.
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:02.600]   The goal of all of this is to kind of just create income and try to maximize income,
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:13.800]   and so I'm looking to help him with a strategy to best do that and looking at how to diversify
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:21.560]   some of that income so that it's not all moving in tandem with the stock market, for instance,
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:26.120]   but dividend paying stocks may be a part of that.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.120]   I'm thinking about...
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:31.240]   You've got me thinking about peer-to-peer lending a little bit.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.120]   He's not crazy about real estate.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.760]   He's sold a rent house.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:41.920]   He still has a rental condo unit, but wanted to get your thoughts on how to approach this
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.360]   focusing on income primarily.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.600]   >>Steve: How much are his living expenses?
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.640]   >>Joshua: Probably $50,000 a year.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.160]   >>Steve: How much is his security income?
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.120]   >>Joshua: I don't know.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.760]   >>Steve: Any guesses?
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:05.000]   $30,000 a year, $1,500 a month, something like that?
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   >>Joshua: Yeah.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   >>Steve: Okay.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   So the first thing to do...
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   >>Joshua: He's got a pension.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.360]   >>Steve: How much is the pension?
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.360]   Any idea?
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.480]   >>Joshua: I think it's about $2,000 a month.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.480]   >>Steve: Okay.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:21.040]   So that plus the Social Security should come close to covering his living expenses if your
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.040]   numbers are accurate.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.960]   Do you think that's about the case?
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.720]   >>Joshua: Yeah.
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.280]   >>Steve: Okay.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:33.280]   So the first step is you need to find out about his living expenses.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.320]   Let's assume $50,000 a year for the sake of conversation, but you confirm those through
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.280]   whatever means you can find out.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.040]   Number two is you find out about his current sources of income.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.920]   If he's got a pension of $2,000 a month, that's $24,000 a year.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:54.240]   If he's got Social Security of, I don't know, $1,500 a month, we're up to $3,500 a month.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.400]   We're up to what, $38,000, $40,000 a year?
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:02.960]   So there's only about a $10,000 spread or a $10,000 lack if those numbers are accurate.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.600]   So what you want to do is first analyze those numbers because those numbers are going to
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.060]   make all the difference in the world in terms of what he needs to do.
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:16.240]   If he didn't have a pension, if he didn't have Social Security, and he needed to spend
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:22.760]   $50,000 a year to maintain his lifestyle, that's a very different investment question
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:30.200]   than is him needing $10,000 a year from a $700,000 to $800,000 capital base.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:36.600]   So you need to nail down those numbers and then ask this question, "What is my investment
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.720]   goal?"
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.240]   So what do I mean?
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.840]   Your dad might be the kind of person who's just steady, relaxed, has a great lifestyle,
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.000]   loves where he lives, loves how he lives.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.120]   You said, "Dad, I'm going to make for you $10,000 of income a month."
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.640]   You'd say, "What would I do with the extra $5,000?
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.400]   I just need $5,000."
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.400]   He wouldn't spend the money.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.120]   It would just sit in the bank account.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.960]   On the other hand, maybe he would.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.400]   Maybe if he had more money, it would totally transform his lifestyle.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.720]   He'd buy a Winnebago.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.600]   He'd start going back and forth all around the United States or he'd spend summers in
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.600]   Europe.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.600]   Maybe he would spend the money.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.800]   So you got to get clear on what do you need the money for?
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.760]   What's the goal of the money?
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.400]   And would you spend the money?
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.840]   So let me pause for a moment.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.840]   If your dad had more income, would it affect his lifestyle?
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:29.680]   Is there anything that he would do that he's not currently doing if he had more money?
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.680]   Not dramatically.
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:31.680]   No.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:39.920]   No, he would probably be more generous with his kids and grandkids and his church maybe,
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:46.960]   but no, he's not going to take off all around the world and change his lifestyle in any
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.960]   big way.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.920]   He's pretty steady, conservative guy.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:56.800]   So, the first thing to do is you want to look at the portfolio and you want to think about
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.560]   how do we meet this income?
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.040]   You said he has a rental condo that he also has?
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.040]   Yes.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.040]   Okay.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:07.840]   So, I'm going to guess, just an educated professional guess here.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.240]   I'm going to guess that if you sit down with these numbers and you ask him, if he's got
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:17.520]   a $2,000 a month pension, if he's got social security from a normal working life span,
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.520]   which the reason I know that he's got that is because he's accumulated $800,000.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.640]   That's very unusual for retirees to accumulate $800,000.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.160]   That means that he earned a decent wage.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.400]   He was frugal with his money.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.360]   To your knowledge, is he debt free?
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.360]   Yes.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.760]   Okay, debt free.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.200]   So, he needs $50,000 a year.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:40.660]   If he's got a rental condo, a pension, and a normal social security wage, he's probably
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:44.160]   got at least $40,000 if not $45,000 or $50,000.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:51.080]   So, now the question doesn't become, how do we draw income from a $700,000 nest egg?
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:56.600]   The question becomes, what do we do with the $700,000 nest egg that's going to properly
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.920]   provide for our goals?
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:03.040]   If your dad needs income and he doesn't want to take investment risk, he could do something
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.280]   like buy an annuity.
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:10.440]   That's where if he wanted maximum income, he said, "I don't want risk."
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.520]   He's investing in municipal bonds because he's concerned about risk.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:19.240]   I would sell him, if I still had a life insurance license, I would sell him a variable annuity.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:23.880]   A variable annuity is an awesome solution to a situation like this.
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.760]   You say he wants more money, he's going to spend more money.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:33.800]   An immediate variable annuity, he gives the insurance company, I don't know, $300,000,
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.800]   $500,000.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.000]   The insurance company, they invest it into a portfolio of mutual funds.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.340]   The insurance company will make a deal with him and they'll say, "Listen, we'll give you
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.160]   a check every single month for the rest of your life.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.400]   You will never outlive that money.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:55.320]   We'll put the money into a 60% or 80% stock fund, 40% bonds.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.620]   He's got social security and a pension and he's debt free.
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.520]   That covers most of his living expenses so he can afford to do that."
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.880]   Your dad would be getting thousands of dollars every single month for the rest of his life
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:08.160]   and that would go up every single month basically for the rest of his life depending on the
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.780]   performance of the stock market, but he would never outlive the money.
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:17.080]   If his number one goal is to spend more money, that would be the way to do it because it
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.680]   eliminates the risk of him running out of money.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:24.280]   There would be some investment risk depending on what specific investments he put into that
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:29.240]   variable annuity, but the annuity would elegantly solve an income problem like that.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.840]   Doesn't get him involved in more real estate, very, very simple, just has lots of money.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.520]   But in your situation, that's not the right solution because he doesn't need the money.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.080]   He's not going to spend it.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.320]   So now what does he want the money for?
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.640]   Well, you got some choices.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:47.280]   If he's going to give the money away, then you want to ask him, "Does he want to give
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:51.520]   the money away now or does he want to give the money away when he's dead?
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.600]   And to whom is he going to give the money?"
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.320]   So if his goal is, "I want to give the money to a charity, to my church," something like
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:01.040]   that, I would encourage him not to do that.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.240]   When he's dead, I mean.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.880]   I would encourage him to start doing that while he's alive.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.640]   One of the big dangers if someone doesn't need money is they start giving it away when
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.080]   they're dead.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.800]   Better to give it away while you're alive and you can be sure that people are accountable
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.800]   for it.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.360]   Now the balance, of course, is how much money does he need as an emergency fund?
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.080]   How much money can he give away?
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:23.320]   But if he's just going to keep this money and give it away, then maybe he gives away
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.780]   some of it now.
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.920]   Maybe he invests the money into people now.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.640]   Maybe he's charitably inclined, but he says, "I'm going to do it now."
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.960]   He's going to have it invested into kids' experiences.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.440]   He might invest it in, or sorry, his grandkids' experiences.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.760]   Maybe he does go ahead and buy the RV so that he can take the grandkids around the country.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.960]   Maybe he does.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:49.760]   Maybe he buys a lake house so that you and all the children can have a place where we
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.760]   really want to do that.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:51.760]   Maybe he buys a beach house.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.600]   There are many options there depending on the vision.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.960]   Now if we come back to the investment perspective, let's say he says, "All right, I don't need
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.400]   the money now.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.640]   I want to give the money away when I'm dead.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.000]   I'm not going to give it away now.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   I want to have the money as a backup fund.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.840]   Maybe I need some kind of ongoing care and I need the money.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.280]   I can't just get rid of the money and I don't need the income."
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:18.240]   Well, now we're going to go back and say, "What is the risk that you're concerned about?
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.520]   Are you concerned about the loss of principle or are you concerned about the loss of purchasing
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.640]   power?"
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.200]   The frustrating situation that we're in right now, especially and including with a muni
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:32.120]   bond portfolio, is the interest rates stink.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:37.480]   Doesn't mean that there's no reason to buy bonds, but if interest rates go up, bond prices
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.000]   are going to fall.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.160]   So we've got some significant risk there.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.920]   Are interest rates going to go down?
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.360]   Basically what a bond portfolio can do for you right now is it can basically assure you
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.080]   the preservation of your capital so that you can take advantage of the next opportunity
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.440]   because the rate you're getting on your money stinks.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.360]   And if rates go up, your bond values go down.
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:04.720]   So you kind of got a problem here, which moves us in the direction of a more aggressive investment
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:07.900]   portfolio that's actually going to have a return.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:12.200]   And so the biggest thing that retirees, the biggest mistake retirees make is they're often
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:18.300]   concerned about the volatility of a portfolio rather than having income that actually keeps
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:21.520]   pace with inflation.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.440]   And I'm more concerned about having income that keeps pace with inflation than I am about
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.500]   the volatility of a portfolio.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:31.460]   My aunt called me up a couple months ago and she was worried about stock markets plummeting
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:34.380]   thousands of points every day.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:39.820]   We're all, I'm not, we're all worrying, legitimately so, right?
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:44.300]   Our worries and our fears about the current economic situation, in my opinion, are well
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:46.020]   placed.
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:49.580]   Just because the stock market has come roaring back doesn't mean that our fears are not well
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:50.660]   placed.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:52.820]   And she calls me up and says, "Joshua, what do I do, right?
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:56.420]   I've got X amount of dollars invested.
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:57.420]   It's in the stock market.
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.860]   I don't know what I should do."
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.140]   So I talked her through it, right?
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:03.700]   At the end of the day, I talked her through this analysis and it was exactly the same
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:04.700]   thing.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.660]   Like a similar situation to what your father is in so many ways.
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:11.000]   And I said to her, I said, "Listen, you've got income.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.440]   You don't have debt.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.340]   You can be frugal and live on the income that you have, the income sources that are stable."
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:18.220]   I said, "Don't touch the money.
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:19.580]   Just leave it alone."
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:24.180]   But the benefit, if somebody stays in a stock portfolio that has a higher expectation of
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:29.300]   return, is they have the benefit of the potential of having far more money that can keep up
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:33.900]   with the pace of inflation and possibly leave a lot more money behind.
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:37.620]   So if your dad is 79 years old, and let's say we do a 20-year perspective, and let's
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:39.580]   say he doesn't spend the money, right?
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:42.620]   Put in 20 for our end.
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:45.580]   He keeps $200,000 to $300,000 on the side as his emergency fund, and we've just got
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.100]   a $500,000 portfolio.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:50.580]   So we'll put $500,000 as our present value.
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:53.220]   Let's put no contributions, so no payments.
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:59.300]   And let's compare a 3% return to a 7% return.
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:03.620]   Well, 3% return in 20 years, he's got $903,000.
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:09.640]   A 7% return, he's got $1.9 million.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.860]   That's a huge difference when you're talking about leaving money behind for a charity.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:20.020]   Do you make a $900,000 bequest to a local church or a $1.9 million bequest to a local
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.020]   church?
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:26.500]   Do you make a $900,000 contribution to a trust fund for your grandchildren or a $1.9
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.100]   million trust fund for your grandchildren?
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:32.620]   And those kinds of differences are achievable if he moves in the direction of an aggressive
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.180]   portfolio.
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:40.180]   So I've complicated the answer to demonstrate what he needs is he needs a financial advisor.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:44.880]   He needs to sit down with somebody and talk through and say, "What are your goals?
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.880]   What do you actually want to do with the money?"
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.380]   And then try to find, after you find out the goals, then try to find some kind of solution
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:54.060]   that will fit that.
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:59.020]   At the end of the day, maybe it is muni bonds and cash.
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.180]   Something wrong with it.
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:07.980]   But I want to make sure that he's really clear on why he's doing that because to me, there's
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:12.380]   a big cost to missing out potentially on that $1 million.
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:15.900]   If you're trying to give money away, again, it's valuable to give away that $1 million.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:22.860]   I think it's easier to educate somebody and show them with math what I've just done, hopefully,
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:27.100]   here in public, to show them with math that they don't need to be worried about market
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.620]   volatility.
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:34.060]   If your dad's portfolio had been $500,000 of stocks and it had dropped down to $300,000
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:41.460]   of stocks, and if he had stuck with it, like I got my aunt to do, then the blip in the
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:45.660]   stock market over the last few months wouldn't have affected him because his pension would
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.420]   have still come in, his social security would have still come in, and maybe his rent would
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:49.420]   have still come in.
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:52.340]   He would have, of course, a couple hundred thousand dollars of cash on the side that
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.300]   he could still keep invested.
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:58.380]   Volatility is not something that someone in his situation should be concerned about.
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:59.380]   It's not.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:00.900]   He shouldn't worry about it.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:05.340]   What he should be concerned about is that his investments are actually going to help
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:07.980]   him achieve his financial goals, whatever they are.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:14.020]   In conclusion, if he needs income, if he wants to spend money, I think a variable annuity
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.700]   would be a great solution to provide him with a little bit of excess income.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.380]   I would probably do a hybrid.
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:23.900]   He sounds like he doesn't need a lot of income, but I would do a hybrid, maybe a couple hundred
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.740]   thousand dollars into a variable annuity.
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:29.260]   The reason it's got to be a variable annuity is you want that annuity payment to keep pace
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:30.940]   with inflation.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:35.700]   Buying an annuity would give him the benefit of making sure that he has an income stream
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:40.660]   that he'll never outlive, but that income stream can participate in the performance
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:46.580]   of mutual fund investments, stock market investments, so that it can keep pace with inflation and
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:50.540]   it'll reflect what happens with the overall market performance.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:54.820]   If he needs some more income and he doesn't want to buy more rental houses and whatnot,
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:58.860]   I would think that some amount of money, and at 79 years old, the mortality tables will
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:02.780]   work really well, I would think some amount of money into a variable annuity would be
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:04.220]   a good solution.
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:07.340]   Then I would keep a significant amount of money in cash, but he probably doesn't need
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:08.340]   300 grand in cash.
[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:12.780]   100 or 150 would be more than enough for him to do whatever he needs to do.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:17.180]   Then I would try to put the rest of it into some kind of longer term investment.
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.180]   Now that could be a couple of things.
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:20.460]   It could be the market, if you have a good thing.
[01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:22.740]   It'd be fine for him to buy an index fund.
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:28.780]   I'd be fine if the numbers that we said were true, and if he bought, let's say put $200,000
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:33.500]   into a variable annuity, so he has another $1,500 a month of income, whatever the numbers
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.580]   of the annuity company would come out to be.
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.620]   Now he's got plenty of income.
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:42.380]   I would be fine if he just put 300 grand in a stock market index fund.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:49.020]   That would be a good tax efficient solution, very tax efficient to leave behind.
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:53.060]   If he doesn't want to invest in stocks, then I would think about some kind of long term
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:57.020]   speculative low maintenance real estate option.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:59.260]   So maybe he buys farmland.
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:01.340]   Something like that could work out.
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:03.460]   Could have minimal management needs.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:07.020]   He's not dealing with a lot of toilets and things like that.
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:10.580]   But if you invested the money strategically, maybe that could work out.
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:15.360]   And then if he's leaving it behind as an inheritance, then it would be a very tax efficient thing
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.360]   to do.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.780]   If he invested $300,000 into raw land or farmland, again, I don't know if that's a good investment
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:28.420]   where you are, but let's say you could find $300,000 of farmland or raw land.
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:33.140]   The characteristics of that kind of investment would be really nice for his situation, because
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:35.820]   it wouldn't create income.
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:39.020]   Or if the income did come in, it would be modest.
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:42.180]   Most of the growth in it would be capital gains, because he doesn't need the income.
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:45.180]   Remember, in my kind of play scenario here, he doesn't need the income.
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:48.060]   So we don't want to create income if we don't need it.
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.020]   What we want is capital gains.
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:55.020]   And if he owns the farmland, he doesn't have this money in a 401ks, he just owns it.
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:56.860]   I'm assuming because he has muni bonds.
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:57.860]   Is that correct?
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:01.220]   That the $500,000 is not inside of a qualified account of some kind?
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:02.220]   Correct.
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:03.220]   Okay.
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:04.820]   So he buys farmland.
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:05.980]   It's a capital gain asset.
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:08.460]   He pays $300,000 of farmland.
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:13.740]   That farmland grows over the next 20 years, and it's worth $1.2 million.
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:21.900]   He dies 20 years from now, and he leaves that $1.2 million to somebody or something, family
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:25.820]   trust, children outright, grandchildren outright, local church, whatever.
[01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:29.140]   Now, that's going to be a step up in tax basis.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:33.420]   And so all of the gain from the $300,000 to the $1.2 million, the $900,000 of gain is
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:35.700]   going to be received totally tax free.
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:38.500]   And yet the whole time, he's got that safe asset.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:43.100]   So there are several investments that could work.
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:46.920]   Hopefully there are some creative ideas to get you thinking about the type of attributes
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:50.060]   of an investment that would be good for him that he would actually need.
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:51.060]   Okay.
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:54.860]   Where do you get pricing on variable annuities?
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:55.860]   Talk to an insurance agent.
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:56.860]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:57.860]   You just want to talk to an insurance agent.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:03.500]   So with a variable annuity, what you want to do is you want to talk to the high level
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.820]   companies, the A-ranked companies.
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:11.100]   And so my standard, I'm a little biased because I used to work for one of the big mutual insurance
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:15.140]   companies, but my standard is start with the big mutual insurance companies, call a New
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:21.340]   York Life agent, call a Northwestern Mutual agent, call a Mass Mutual agent, maybe a Guardian
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:22.540]   agent.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:30.380]   The reason why those are important is unlike insurance that's largely brokered in the business,
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:34.620]   the insurance agents that work for those big traditional life insurance companies, they're
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:37.420]   trained a little bit better on insurance products.
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:41.520]   And so an annuity product like that is going to be better.
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.100]   All of those companies mentioned, New York Life and Northwestern Mutual are going to
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:46.100]   be the best.
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.100]   Mass Mutual, also good.
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:48.780]   Guardian, also probably pretty good.
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:56.700]   And all those insurance companies are going to have vanilla, simple, variable annuities
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:57.700]   that are available.
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.820]   And so what you can do is you can't get...
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.460]   So those you put in the principal and you don't get it back, right?
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:09.940]   They look at your mortality and they promise you income based on the principal you put
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:13.460]   in, your mortality, and a little bit of market fluctuation.
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:14.460]   Exactly.
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:22.340]   So you write a check for $250,000, you'll never see the $250,000 again, but the insurance
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.620]   company promises you that you're going to get a monthly payment every single month for
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:26.620]   the rest of your life.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:31.620]   Now, there are about 70 different options that the insurance agent will go over with
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:34.660]   you as far as what those payments look like.
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:38.220]   So again, there's options of variable versus fixed.
[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:40.860]   There are options of guarantees.
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:45.340]   Do you want a guaranteed return of your $250,000 over time, even to your beneficiaries?
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:48.240]   Or are you willing to give that up for a higher monthly payment?
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.060]   What portfolio do you want the money into?
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:53.100]   And so that's the insurance agent's job where they'll model those things and walk you through
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:54.100]   the options.
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:55.100]   But that's...
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:56.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.100]   But correct.
[01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:00.300]   I would start with some phone calls there and then see what the insurance agents have
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:01.300]   to say.
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:02.300]   Okay.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:03.300]   Cool.
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.300]   All right.
[01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:05.300]   Awesome.
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.300]   Very good.
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:09.700]   Thanks for helping your dad and I appreciate you doing that.
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:13.700]   It's one of the biggest things and just kind of last public service announcement that I
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:20.540]   would say is while you're doing that with your dad, make sure that you are facilitating
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:26.740]   this kind of open communication between you as a family.
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:31.900]   Because one of the things you want to take care of, be careful for is elderly people
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:36.140]   are often abused by scams in the financial business.
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:38.820]   And so it sounds like you've got a good open relationship.
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:43.220]   One of the most valuable things that you can do is cultivate that good open relationship.
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:47.700]   If possible, I would ask my dad to make a commitment to me and say, "Listen, please
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:51.220]   don't do anything with money that we don't talk about.
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.220]   Don't invest in anything.
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.060]   Don't do anything with money."
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:57.580]   You have to have a good relationship and mutual trust for him to do that.
[01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:03.280]   But that way you can help to protect him from being taken advantage of by the sharks that
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.340]   are out there in the financial business.
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:10.940]   In addition, while you're doing those things, think through account access, supervision,
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:11.940]   etc.
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:15.260]   Because it just becomes – it's generally demonstrated.
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:18.800]   It becomes more difficult for us to make good decisions with money as we get older.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:23.180]   So in addition to what you're doing, just cultivate that open relationship and that
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.580]   way you'll be able to be an advocate for him.
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:27.100]   That's it for today's podcast.
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.420]   Thank you all for listening and I'm glad that you're here.
