[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.320]   All right, I need everybody to take a deep breath here because I'm about to stress you
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.360]   out. But hopefully at the end, I'll relieve that stress a little bit with some ideas and
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.960]   solutions for you. So I need everybody to just think for a second. Reflect on the past 45 days
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.440]   and think about all the possible things that have gone on in our industry and all the product
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.140]   launches. Let me highlight just a few for you. Notion launched a Granola, Glean, and ChatGPT
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.760]   competitors. Figma launched a Canva, Framer, Illustrator, and Lovable competitor. Atlassian
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.460]   launched a Granola, Glean competitor plus Claude integrations. Anthropic launches a Glean competitor
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.260]   with Claude integrations. Google launches Codex, Lovable, and many other competitors. OpenAI
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.400]   bought a Cursor competitor, launches Codex, and a lot more. Right? This is just one little
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.080]   microcosm of the entire tech industry. But if you look around at all the different categories
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.880]   of software right now, the same exact thing is happening. And I haven't even mentioned the
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.000]   horde of startups, well-funded startups, that are getting funded in every single one of these
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.140]   spaces as well. And among all of this chaos, we have companies that are essentially collapsing
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.500]   in months rather than years. Chegg was one of the first ones to go that declined over 90%
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.140]   in the matter of months. And of course, Stack Overflow was one of the early victims as well
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.060]   when ChatGPT launched. So this gets to the number one question that we all need to be answering.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.000]   Right? A lot of people at this conference are talking about how product is doing more engineering,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.060]   engineering is doing more product work, designs doing more product work, all the tactical, all the
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.220]   technical, all of those different infrastructure. But none of that matters. None of it matters unless
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.960]   you answer this question. What do I build and why will it win? And the interesting thing about this
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.160]   is this was always the job of product. It just happens to be that over the years, it got marred in all of
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.580]   this project management, agile process, all of this type of stuff. But this is what always separated
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.640]   great product managers from good product managers and product leaders. This is Sean Clouse. He's the
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.400]   chief product officer at Confluent. He was formerly chief product officer at MuleSoft. He was the first
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.380]   head of growth at Atlassian as well. And I thought he encapsulated well. He said, you're constantly trying to
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.640]   get ahead. You're trying to find the angle. The question that has not yet been asked that gives you an
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.580]   insight that is not being actioned by other people. It doesn't just have to be an insight. It has to be
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.940]   an insight that others are not actioning. Because if you find that insight and others aren't actioning it,
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:51.600]   that is your competitive advantage. Now, the problem is, is that this question has gotten 10x harder.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.820]   This is a rough map of Gettysburg. And I thought it was a good analogy because this was one of the
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.480]   bloodiest battles in the Civil War. And this kind of represents the map that we are all playing in in the
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.020]   competitive environment right now. We have fast, huge moving incumbents like Microsoft, Google,
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.340]   and Meta. There are these new huge horizontal platforms like ChatGPT and Anthropic that are
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.280]   eating up major use cases. We have foundational shifts in the technology landscape, not on a yearly
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.080]   basis, on a monthly basis. And there are hordes and hordes of startups being funded, including five or
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.560]   six in every single category that has traction by YC, every single cohort.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:40.040]   This is you sitting in the middle of all of this, right? And the question is, is how in the world do you find a
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.520]   seam among all of these players to potentially find some traction and win? That's the question we have to answer
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.000]   before any of the other stuff like technology, infrastructure, or even what our roles are
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.380]   in the organization. I'm Brian. I'm founder and CEO of Reforge. And if you notice, I have a little bit
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.220]   more gray hair and wrinkles from this picture because I've been around in tech for about 25 years, been doing
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.440]   startups the whole time. I played in some pretty competitive environments. I helped HubSpot launch their CRM
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.140]   almost a decade ago. And at that time, that was a crazy competitive category. People thought we were
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.340]   bonkers. My guess is if I took a raise of hand, probably over 50% of your companies are using that CRM
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.820]   today. Now, that was a competitive environment. But what I'm experiencing now and what we're all
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.600]   experiencing is probably 10x that. And so a little history about Reforge is that we've been around for
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.180]   about 10 years. We've helped thousands of product teams, including all the ones you see here, over 100,000
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.700]   professionals. I hope some of you have been part of Reforge in the past. And the way that we've done it
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.700]   is that we've built a community of over 400 experts on the front lines to decode all of their best
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.980]   practices. We started by doing that with 40-plus expert-led courses, including our AI courses. But a
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.380]   couple years ago, we started to take a shift and started to encode all of this knowledge into AI
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.560]   agents. Our first one, Reforge Insights, which acts like your AI product researcher. Our second one,
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.320]   called Compass, is your AI project manager, that takes care of all of those low-level,
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.240]   low-value tasks that involve product management automated for you. We have two more coming later
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.380]   this year. But back to this question. How do you win in the intense environment in the history of
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.780]   technology? I spent a few months with Ravi Mehta thinking about this exact question. He created our
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.900]   AI strategy course. He was the former chief product officer at Tinder. He also was a product leader at
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.040]   Facebook, Microsoft, TripAdvisor, and a bunch more. And the way that we start to answer this question
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.580]   is actually, we need to think about the traps. And the two most common traps are, of course, one,
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.640]   how do you, like reinventing the AI wheel? You do not need to build custom models in infrastructure
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.980]   in order to answer this question. And on the opposite side is the other trap, which is just
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.900]   implementing, copying, and pasting basic AI features like chatbots into your product.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:04.900]   The answer actually lies in the middle, which is treating AI like a series of Lego blocks where you
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.440]   assemble differentiated AI features and products by integrating the best available AI capabilities
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.020]   with your product's data and functionality. Your competitive advantage will come from what is
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:24.360]   uniquely yours. These three things, your data, your functionality, and your understanding of unmet customer
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:31.580]   needs, not the AI itself. So let's think about the anatomy of a winning AI product. What are the major
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.280]   building blocks? What are the major Lego pieces? And how do you stack them together, connect them to create
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.520]   something differentiated? Well, we can start to talk about this, the AI capabilities, because there's a ton of
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.520]   Lego pieces that are emerging every year, whether it's the pre-trained AI models, or the
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:55.520]   abilities to perform tasks, audio processing, imaging process, all of these new capabilities that feel magical now that
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:02.360]   we couldn't do before. But the thing about all of these Lego blocks is you just don't have access to them, everybody
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:10.320]   else has access to them as well. So even though AI products and features, of course, use one of these Legos as its core Lego
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   blocks, this is not where differentiation and competitive advantage comes from. That starts with one of these pieces,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   your data. Because your data is what provides context to an AI model to generate a unique output. The more unique
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.320]   your data is, the more unique output you can generate for your customer. And there's a bunch of different types of data.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.320]   There's real-time data that the models might not have incorporated into their training set. There's user-specific data. There's
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:46.320]   domain-specific data, like we've seen emerging in legal, in healthcare. There's human judgment data around curation, as well as
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:53.320]   data. Now the question about data is, how do you actually combine multiple categories of data together to form some
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:01.320]   uniqueness? As well as, it's not about the quantity of your data, it's about marginal value of your data over everybody
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:10.320]   else, especially the big models. So how much additional value does your data add over what is already trained in the models?
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:17.320]   The third piece is your functionality, because this determines how the AI behaves and it gives your AI product superpowers.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:23.320]   There's multiple types of Lego blocks around your functionality. Specialized workflows, unique algorithms, business
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:29.320]   rules, integrations, whatever it is that's baked into your product. Now the key about assembling all these pieces is that
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   they work like a system. And you have to connect the system in order to build that competitive differentiation.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:46.320]   Let's start with this. Your data is what provides and informs the AI's understanding. It's what helps the AI generate a unique output.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   And that unique output, as a result, is what helps you build an additional repository of unique data so that it continues to flow in a flywheel.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:05.320]   On the other side of the spectrum is your functionality. Your functionality in your product is how your product controls the AI
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:15.320]   actions, how it interacts with AI, when it calls it to create a delightful user experience. And in addition, AI is increasingly able to call
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:22.320]   tools in the functionality of your product itself. And those two things work together as a system as well.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   So, let's take all of this theory and let's put it into practice. Let's talk about a product, granola.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   Just by a raise of hands, how many people have either tried or used granola today?
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:44.320]   Okay, pretty decent amount. That's probably like 40% of the room. A year ago, that would have been zero. And I think this is an interesting case, because they entered a space that already had a horde of
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:51.320]   a horde of other AI note-takers, whether that was Fathom, Otter, Fireflies. There was a ton of them.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   But somehow, they found a seam. And they've garnered 40% of your attention in this room and about $50 million in funding.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:08.320]   So, let's go back to those three fundamental questions in those Lego bricks. What was uniquely theirs? Their data, their functionality, and their understanding of their unmet customer need.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:15.320]   So, I'm going to start with the last one. So, at the time when they entered the market space, this is just a sample of people who are already in
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:23.320]   market, including all of the incumbents like Zoom and Meet that have AI-native note-taking capabilities. But they were all approaching it from the
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   perspective of the product is going to do something for the user. It's going to replace the full job. They want somebody else to take my meeting notes.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:41.320]   What they realized is actually there's a whole other set of customer needs that have been unmet, which is, I don't want you to take all of my notes.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:48.320]   I just want you to help me take better notes, empower me around this specific task and user. And that's what they built the product around.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   Now, in order to start, they used off-the-shelf capabilities. No unique models, no custom training, nothing.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.320]   They used Deepgram for transcription. They used Anthropic and OpenAI for some of their other functionality.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:08.320]   But the uniqueness came in how they assembled the Lego blocks, starting on the left-hand side with Granola's data, right?
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:14.320]   Their context includes both the notes that you take as well as the transcription that they generate.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   They used the AI Lego block to generate a unique output, which is they enhance better notes.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:26.320]   Those notes, over time, form a repository that starts to enable all sorts of other features that they've layered on,
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.320]   like chatting across meetings, their project workspaces, all their downflow actions.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:37.320]   So they have this nice flywheel of unique context in data that's starting to spin.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.320]   That was partially enabled by the right-hand side of the Lego blocks, their functionality.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:47.320]   They used a Mac app so that they could detect when meetings started to access the system sound for transcription,
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   like being right there at the user moment that they needed it to enable the AI to do those things.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:00.320]   And they've also plugged into other tools and integrations like the calendar to get metadata about the meetings,
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   such as attendees. So they assembled these Lego blocks to meet in that unique way to meet that unique customer need.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.320]   Now the question is, is Granola going to survive?
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.320]   I've got no idea, right?
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.320]   It's incredibly competitive landscape.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.320]   Because the realization is that you can't stop here.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   You can't stop by just assembling your initial set of Lego bricks.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.320]   You have to sequence over and over again.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:31.320]   You have to take those first three Lego bricks, leverage them into another unique set that you assemble.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   And you see Granola doing this.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:44.320]   Now that they've enabled this, they've started to create project and team workspaces and start to enable a new set of unique use cases off of the initial layer that they did.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   They've started to integrate downstream actions like connecting to your CRM and HubSpot.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   I just saw them the other day experimenting with a company wiki that auto-updates itself.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.320]   So they continue to sequence these things into a unique set of building blocks.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.320]   The question is, will they keep up?
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.320]   I don't know.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:10.320]   Jamin Ball, a partner at Altimeter Capital, recently wrote a newsletter and he said, the real moat is just a sequence of smaller moats stacked together.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.320]   Each one buys time.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   What you do with that time, how fast you execute, how quickly you evolve, determines whether you stay ahead.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.320]   If the moat used to be six to 12 months, today, it's two to three weeks.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:32.320]   So, to recap, to win an AI, besides being stressed out, right, is to answer, what are your unmet customer problems?
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.320]   That's always been a part of product, right?
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.320]   The second is, what AI capabilities can solve those problems in novel ways?
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.320]   What proprietary data can power those solutions?
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.320]   And then what superpowers can our product give to AI?
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   How do you assemble those three foundational Lego blocks?
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.320]   All right, thank you.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.320]   If you're an AI engineer, we are hiring.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.320]   Our team will be outside.
