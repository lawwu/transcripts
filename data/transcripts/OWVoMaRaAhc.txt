[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   Here on the podcast, we often speak to wives with spiritually apathetic husbands.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.020]   Episode 1315 comes to mind, "My husband is passive.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.020]   What can I do?"
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.360]   But here's a question from a wife in an over half-century long marriage, and in this
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.280]   case the husband is not spiritually passive.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.720]   "Dear Pastor John, I'm married to a wonderfully godly man.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.800]   We have a strong marriage of over 50 years.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.360]   My husband daily spends time in scripture and is a big fan of your writings.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.480]   We pray together over meals and occasionally in particular times of need, but not regularly,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.520]   not in the mornings or evenings.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.520]   We've had many discussions about it.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.800]   It would be my desire to do so.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.840]   He feels like prayer should be personal, and when people pray together, they're focused
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.600]   on what the other one is thinking and feel to relate to God.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.640]   I've heard various speakers and authors say a couple should pray together to strengthen
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.520]   their marriages, and I can think of many good things that are the result of praying together,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.400]   such as feelings of intimacy, knowing my husband's heart better, and being able to encourage
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.360]   others by letting them know we're praying for them as a couple.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.280]   But my husband says those are not reasons to pray.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520]   He read this question and is interested too.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.880]   Can you help us, Pastor John?"
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.120]   Given the uniqueness of this situation, namely a long marriage, a godly man and woman, I'm
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:29.160]   not going to argue that you have to pray together out loud with each other.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.000]   I'm going to argue that this husband should want to.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   That's my argument.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.120]   I'm going to argue biblically that you should want to, not have to, want to, in view of
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:52.640]   the way the New Testament speaks about prayer and in view of your wife's longings.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.040]   And I've got 10 reasons.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.240]   I know this is a short podcast, so let's do these quickly.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.560]   I've got 10 reasons why I think you should want to, and I'll move from the general to
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.640]   the more specific.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.440]   Number one, Jesus taught us to pray our Father who art in heaven, not just my Father who
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.440]   is in heaven.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:28.960]   His assumption seems to be that prayer will be both private, sweet encounter with God—He
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:36.920]   himself went away at night to pray by himself—and a group encounter with God.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.640]   If this is true for a precious church community, a community that we care about, how much more
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.160]   should it be true, it seems to me, of a precious relationship of husband and wife?
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.200]   Number two, over and over in Paul's letters, he prays out loud, so to speak, he writes
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.160]   out loud, that they can hear and read in the presence of his friends so that they hear
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.200]   and know what he's praying for them.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.440]   Paul doesn't merely say, "I pray for you guys," period.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.280]   He says, "I pray for you," and then he does it.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.760]   He does it out loud so they can read what he's praying.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.080]   Now, that would be unnecessary, even misleading, if this were not a good idea for people we
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.720]   care about.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.880]   Prayer is not designed merely for a vertical transaction with God.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.920]   Let me say that again, because it seems like this man has prayer kind of in a pigeonhole
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.560]   of personal intimacy with God.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.680]   Prayer is not designed merely for a vertical transaction with God.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.760]   It is also designed to have a horizontal impact, else Paul wouldn't and Jesus wouldn't have
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.080]   spoken this way.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:01.200]   Number three, Paul illustrates this in gatherings at Corinth by encouraging them to pray out
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.840]   loud and intelligibly in such a way that people can say, "Amen, amen," to what you just said,
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.400]   1 Corinthians 14, 16.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:19.160]   In other words, Paul cultivates a spirit of group or corporate praying precisely with
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.080]   a view to other people, hearing, listening to what you're praying, and then joining with
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.800]   you with the word, "Amen."
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.120]   Yes, I agree with that.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.160]   And Jesus takes this right down to the level of two or three, doesn't he, in Matthew 18,
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.760]   19, and 20.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.820]   If two or three on earth agree about anything that they ask, it will be done for them by
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:52.040]   my Father in heaven, for where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am among
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   them.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.600]   And I can't imagine that it would be more fitting or more desirable for any two people
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.640]   to agree in prayer for something than the two people who live together in the closest
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.340]   bond.
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:16.280]   Number four, 1 Corinthians 11, 5 picture women praying and prophesying in church with culturally
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.120]   appropriate signs of submission to the church leadership.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:29.200]   Now why would it be fitting and helpful for an entire gathering to hear this woman's heart
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.320]   in prayer while her husband doesn't hear her heart in prayer at home?
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.440]   Number five, most of the Psalms are prayers.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.880]   They're not private.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.900]   They are intended to be heard by others.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.800]   The church has always loved it that David and Asaph and the others welcome us into their
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.800]   prayers.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.840]   "Magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together."
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.640]   God delights in His people having the grace to exalt and having the humility to exalt
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   together.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.160]   It makes me want to ask, is there a pride problem here?
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.440]   It takes humility to expose yourself, your soul, your longings, your intimate ways of
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.880]   talking to a spouse.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.880]   It takes humility.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.320]   You've got to be vulnerable.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.080]   Number six, I am glad that you pray at meals.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:35.880]   I assume that you, in praying at meals, give thanks to God out loud, together, and I think
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.380]   that's fitting and beautiful.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.860]   You could keep it private.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.380]   Both of you could bow in silence at the table over your food.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.320]   Why don't you?
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:54.760]   Because you know intuitively and from the Psalms that thanking God out loud together
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.240]   is part of how He intends to be glorified.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.480]   I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.920]   I will sing praises to you among the nations.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:15.260]   If among the nations, how much more naturally among the family, and why only at meals?
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.640]   Number seven, God teaches us to bear one another's burdens.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.920]   Galatians 6.2, "Husbands and wives have many burdens."
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.520]   Oh my.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:33.440]   Why would it be fitting to say to a spouse, "I am bearing your burden to the Lord,"
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.700]   but not let her hear you bear her burden to the Lord?
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:46.900]   James 5.16 says, "Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.900]   you may be healed."
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:55.200]   Why would that be a precious experience of out loud confession and intercession with
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.880]   fellow Christians, but not with our spouse?
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:07.600]   Number eight, "Since a husband and a wife become one flesh, they are the most intimate
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.440]   human relationship that there is on earth.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.400]   There is one other relationship more intimate, namely with the Lord."
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.200]   These two relationships are compared to each other in Ephesians 5.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.120]   Neither is to be characterized by distrust of the other.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:35.240]   When both are as they should be, they blend in intimacy.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.640]   It would be a mark of defect if one of these relationships—the one with the Lord, the
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:46.760]   one with the spouse—if one of these relationships had secrets from the other.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:54.960]   Therefore, a mark of health is when intimate communion with the Lord and intimate communion
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:00.240]   with the spouse blend in moments of prayer.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:09.160]   Number nine, 1 Peter 3.7 says that we husbands should honor our wives as fellow heirs of
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.800]   the grace of life.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:21.640]   Would not part of that honoring her as a fellow heir be an honoring her with the deepest communications
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:29.880]   of our heart to the Lord from whom we will both inherit eternal life?
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.480]   And number 10, "Is it not enough, brother?"
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.840]   I'm talking to you, husband, now.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.160]   Thank you for listening and being gracious enough to let your wife inquire like this.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:47.520]   "Is it not enough, dear brother, that she asks for this?"
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.880]   There are thousands of men who would give their right arm if their wives really wanted
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.120]   to pray for them.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.240]   I mean pray with them.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.800]   Thousands of men who would give their right arm if their wives would say what your wife
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   is saying.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.440]   Please pray with me.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.040]   Outdo one another in showing honor.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.720]   Honor her with this gift—it's a gift—that she's asking for.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:22.440]   You are, as it were, Christ to her, and she is, as it were, the church to you.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:31.360]   What would Christ say if the church said, "Would you speak to the Father with me?"
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:40.160]   So dear, dear friends, you are not commanded in so many words to do this, but I think you
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.160]   should want to.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.840]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that word.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.840]   I appreciate it.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.600]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.640]   If you have not subscribed to Ask Pastor John yet, consider doing so in your favorite podcast
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.400]   app or in YouTube or in Spotify.

[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.600]   Well one of the dynamics of the church is that as you mature in the faith, you learn
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.120]   how to help others mature in the faith.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.720]   We're all called to this work.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.640]   It's called discipleship.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.560]   So how do we become disciples?
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.440]   How do we grow into Christian sages?
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   Pastor John will share one really important factor in this process.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.400]   That's up next time on Wednesday.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.160]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:24.660]   [END]
