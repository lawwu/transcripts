[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.300]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,

[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.860]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need

[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.960]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.340]   in 10 years or less.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.780]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I'm your host,
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.020]   and on today's episode of the podcast,
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.000]   I want to share with you a framework
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.900]   for how to think about investing into your children
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.900]   in the early ages, the early stages of life.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.940]   One of the ideas that I have defended vigorously
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.160]   throughout the history of Radical Personal Finance
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.460]   is the idea that most investments into your children
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.820]   are best made at an early age,
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.020]   rather than waiting for a later age.
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.900]   The best example I would use to introduce this subject
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.100]   is comparing the value of saving
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.020]   for, say, a college education fund
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.980]   as compared to working hard at your child's academic ability
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.940]   at a very early age, perhaps at the age of four,
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.260]   or at the age of eight, or at the age of 12.
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.900]   And I've defended the idea that in virtually all cases,
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.860]   if you have to choose between investing money
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.420]   at an early age versus investing money for use
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.900]   at a later age, you get a much higher return
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.500]   on your investment when you invest it at an early age.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.980]   Now, thankfully, most of us don't have to choose.
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.820]   Most of us have enough money to invest in our children
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.220]   at an early age as well as at a later age,
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.620]   and both are good.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.300]   But if you have to choose,
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.380]   I want you to choose to do it at a young age.
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.960]   I've defended this idea and this thesis
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.540]   in a number of different ways,
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.620]   but I've, to my knowledge and memory,
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.380]   I've never sat down and gone through a philosophy
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.620]   or a framework to help you think about how to apply this
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.580]   at every age, especially at the earliest of ages.
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.820]   And yet, I believe that that's where sometimes your money
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.740]   is most effectively spent and most effectively invested.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.500]   And so on today's episode,
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.000]   I want to share with you a philosophy, a framework,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.100]   and some advice for ways that you can invest
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.220]   into your children at an early age.
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.900]   And then in what I think will be the next episode,
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.540]   I want to walk you through on a daily basis how I do it.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.580]   And I'll share with you in excruciating detail
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.860]   all of the ways that I try myself to invest
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.580]   into my children very, very intentionally.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.260]   Now, clearly this is inspired by recent events
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.340]   in my own life.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.640]   I've been playing Mr. Dad for the last weeks
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.740]   as my wife and I have recently welcomed our fifth child
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.140]   into the world.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.620]   And it's very interesting the difference
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.020]   between my first child and my fifth child,
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.140]   because with now my older children,
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.660]   I've had a chance to see some of my ideas come to fruition,
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.020]   see some of them flourish,
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.560]   and I've had a chance to lay aside some of those ideas
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.580]   that I held when I was younger.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.940]   And in the history of Radical Personal Finance,
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.600]   I also thought this would be interesting to you
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.060]   because all of the history is here recorded in the show.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.180]   When I recorded my first episode of the podcast
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.320]   in July of 2013, my wife and I were expecting
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.880]   our first baby.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.280]   And here we are almost 10 years later,
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.420]   and we have again welcomed our fifth baby.
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.720]   And so at this point in time, for your context,
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.060]   our oldest child is nine, we have a nine-year-old,
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.520]   a seven-year-old, a five-year-old, a three-year-old,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.760]   and now a zero-year-old.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.580]   And so I don't have personal experience
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.060]   with adolescence yet,
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.840]   but I have learned quite a little bit along the way,
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.220]   and I wanna share some of those ideas with you.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.640]   I probably shouldn't make a disclaimer,
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.880]   but I'll make one disclaimer
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.480]   'cause it will help me to feel more confident
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.080]   in what I say.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.080]   I myself am going to try to speak very clearly
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.120]   and about what I know and what I believe to be true
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.400]   in these areas, and I'm going to share
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.560]   as forthrightly as possible my own experience.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.360]   I warn you, I'm rather intense about this subject.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.280]   This is, for me, this area of life
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.280]   is, represents some of my highest personal goals.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.840]   I am fully persuaded that one of the most important functions
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.660]   and roles in a man's life relates to his function
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.640]   in the world, is his role in life as a father.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.140]   And this is, as I can see, a tremendous source
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.080]   of personal joy and fulfillment.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.040]   It is a tremendous source of impact on society,
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.840]   impact on lives and on a community,
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.740]   and indeed is the basic building block of a society,
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.200]   of a healthy and strong society.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.360]   And so I'm very passionate about this subject,
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.440]   and I'm very dedicated to it,
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.400]   both in thinking about it and in practicing it.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.340]   I am imperfect, as is to be expected,
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.580]   but I care a lot about this, and I'm pretty hardcore
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.880]   about my application in some of these things.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.120]   And so when I share things, I'm doing so
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.480]   to try to encourage you and to inspire you,
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.920]   and I'll try to share as forthrightly as possible
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.780]   as to why I think the way that I do
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.560]   and what I've done and what has worked.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.360]   Just know that it's not coming from any desire
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.080]   to be arrogant or to draw attention,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.880]   but it's coming from a desire to encourage you
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.840]   and to give ideas.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.480]   And I, of course, value any ideas that you have
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.600]   or any impact that you might make in my blind spots.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.340]   So in this episode, we're gonna go in detail
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.320]   through a framework for ways that you can invest
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.760]   into the success of your child.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.280]   If you do not have children of your own,
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.100]   then I think this information may still be useful for you
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.920]   because you know children.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.560]   And even if you don't have children, for whatever reason,
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.020]   you know children.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.880]   And one of the most important things that we can do
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.360]   as a society is to invest in a thoughtful
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.480]   and systematic way into our children.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.020]   And regardless of whether you're caring
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.280]   for your own biological children
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.680]   or whether you're caring for children in your community
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.580]   in some way, shape, or form,
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.520]   many of these ideas I think can be implemented
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.660]   and will lead us to a healthier society.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.560]   So I invite even those of you who are not parents
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.600]   to join me in this episode.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.600]   What you should understand is that when you become a parent,
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.960]   much of your outlook on life changes
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.760]   and transforms in a systematic way.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.960]   When you become a parent, you have basically
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.720]   a fairly clear expectation of what the next 15 to 20 years
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.360]   of your life are going to look like.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.680]   And the goals related to your role as a parent
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.720]   quickly filter to the top of your list.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.360]   And over the course of especially the first few weeks
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.200]   of a child's life, first few months of a child's life,
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.880]   you go through this natural transformation as a parent
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.440]   of generally losing a significant amount
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.680]   of your selfishness because you become more other-focused
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.920]   rather than self-focused.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.340]   And so the things that I'm gonna share,
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.920]   if you're not a parent, just recognize
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.160]   that parents will generally resonate with the idea
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.040]   that these are the highest and most important goals.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.940]   Where you see this as an example,
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.000]   I think that is quite commonly visible,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.800]   is in the field of retirement planning
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.760]   versus college planning.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.680]   Financial planners are generally very clear
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.500]   on the importance of your saving for your retirement,
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.800]   even to the exclusion of your paying
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.240]   for your child's education.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.480]   But even though financial planners are very clear
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.040]   about the cold logic of that position,
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.880]   day in and day out, parents will ignore systematically
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.360]   saving for their own financial future
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.960]   in favor of investing into their children's future.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.720]   There's just a very natural flow.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.960]   So let's go to the ideas now.

[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.340]   - Where do we begin?
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.540]   Well, we begin, of course, with babies.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.020]   That's how children start.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.060]   They start as beautiful, wonderful little babies.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.220]   So what can you do to invest into your child
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.440]   at an early age?
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.380]   If we're truly going to approach this topic
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.260]   in a systematic way, we need to begin
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.940]   prior to the conception of the child.
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.780]   And we need to begin by discussing
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.100]   the topic of spouse selection.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.720]   Now, this topic should probably be broken
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.540]   into two different categories.
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:15.540]   The first would be a discussion of basic genetic qualities.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:21.900]   And the second topic would be character qualities
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.300]   or lifestyle qualities, et cetera,
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.140]   kind of the softer things.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.460]   Now, very few of us ever set out
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.960]   with the goal of choosing a spouse
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.480]   in a perfectly analytical way.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.860]   The older I get, the more I have come to appreciate
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.300]   how smart it would be for us to do that.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.340]   When I was younger, and you talked to me
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.640]   about things like arranged marriages
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.600]   that has been common throughout history,
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.820]   I recoiled in horror at the idea
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.620]   of having an arranged marriage.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.500]   I had the idea, well, love is all you need.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.380]   And after all, what if you don't love
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.180]   the person that you're married to?
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.080]   As I have grown older, and as my wife and I
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.660]   have now celebrated 11 years of marriage,
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.980]   I appreciate the concept of love
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.780]   the way that people often refer to it.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.840]   And here, when I'm using the term in this sense,
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.380]   what I mean is I appreciate the concept
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:19.460]   of a basic attraction, one for another.
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.740]   But I think that there's a fundamental component
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.660]   in which compatibility on every level
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.500]   makes a huge difference in the long-term outcome
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.180]   of your relationship.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.780]   And so I think that the practical considerations
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:38.420]   are far higher than many of us have been led to believe
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.540]   by the fairy tales that we've been sold by culture around.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.740]   One of the concerns that I have
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.420]   about relationship formation in the modern age
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:51.060]   is that in many cases, our concepts
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:55.580]   of what is a successful and healthy relationship,
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.780]   what is a successful and healthy family
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.720]   have been formed primarily by fiction writers
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.380]   creating movie scripts, creating stories.
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.980]   And those fiction writers have, in many cases,
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.300]   completely succeeded in helping people
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.300]   to create an idea, an ideal,
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.500]   an expectation of how life should be.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.500]   And yet that script or that image
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.500]   is completely unmoored from reality in any reasonable way.
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.080]   And it is designed primarily to sell movies.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.540]   It's designed to sell books,
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.300]   and it's not designed for human happiness.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.400]   Perhaps a useful example that I would offer
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.840]   would relate to the subject
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.160]   of how a couple should celebrate a wedding ceremony.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   If you were to go and speak to a young 18-year-old man
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.480]   or a young 18-year-old woman,
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.000]   certainly more commonly a woman,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   but I think either sex would share this,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.720]   and you were to ask that young 18-year-old man or woman
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   to describe to you his or her ideal wedding.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.340]   And listen, you would probably get an image
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.080]   that comes to mind that's pretty much
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.220]   the way that you would describe your ideal wedding.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:31.520]   And yet that image would look very much
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.520]   like most ideal weddings that have been presented
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.520]   in pop culture, especially film culture.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.920]   As a financial planner, I see this frequently
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.600]   when we talk about the cost of weddings.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.040]   One reason that young couples give
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.680]   for the idea that they're not married
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.980]   is that they can't afford to get married.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.200]   Now, getting married doesn't actually cost money.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.520]   Weddings can cost money.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.040]   And yet oftentimes you'll have young couples
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.800]   that desire to be married.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.340]   They are already living together as though they are married,
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.880]   but they haven't been able to come up
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.120]   with the money for the wedding.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.280]   I want to ask you something.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.760]   Let's pretend that you had no preconceived ideas
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.400]   about wedding ceremonies and marriages.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.800]   And let's assume that you were giving counsel
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.420]   to a young man and a young woman.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.400]   And that young man or young woman come to you
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.240]   and they say, "Listen, we desire to be
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.920]   "in a relationship together, and we desire to
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.740]   "memorialize or to solemnize the initiation
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.500]   "of that relationship with a party.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.420]   "And so what we're going to do is we're going to spend years
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.860]   "saving money, and we're going to throw
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.500]   "a huge, expensive party, like nothing we have ever done
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.280]   "in our life in any other context.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.480]   "And we're going to host a huge and expensive party
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.660]   "for all of our family and friends.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.420]   "And we're going to spend $10,000, tens of thousands
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.000]   "of dollars, we're going to spend a huge amount of money.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.680]   "Sometimes we'll even borrow money
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.180]   "in order to accomplish this objective.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.660]   "And at that party, our friends and family
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.820]   "will come together, they'll celebrate with us,
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.060]   "and then they'll leave having enjoyed a wonderful day,
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.840]   "and we're going to pay for it.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.300]   "In many cases, we're going to pay for it
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.000]   "over the course of many years."
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.540]   Does that sound like a really lovely thing
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.880]   for the couple in question?
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.880]   And yet, many young couples have had their entire idea,
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.760]   their entire ideal of what a wedding is formed
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:50.640]   such that if it doesn't fulfill what I've just described,
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.640]   then they'll consider it to be something of a failure.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.200]   And yet, who formed that idea?
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.960]   Well, movie script writers with a large production budget
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.460]   have formed that idea and have created that idea.
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.000]   They're the ones who've done that.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.440]   Now, they did it based upon a shred of reality.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.440]   There is a shred of reality, which is the glittering,
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.480]   wealthy, upper class have generally throughout history
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.600]   memorialized and solemnized these events
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.960]   by throwing a huge giant party.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.120]   But of course, these are the people
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.280]   who can comfortably afford to do such a thing,
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.000]   and these are the people that should do such a thing.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.520]   But that's very different than, say,
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.040]   your average 25-year-old couple and what they should do.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.440]   I remember an example of mine,
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.420]   a good friend of mine growing up.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.900]   He and his girlfriend, they were together
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.840]   for a number of years.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.920]   They had three children together
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.840]   before they could afford to have their wedding.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.080]   And he was a blue-collar worker.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.680]   She was busy taking care of babies
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.720]   for a significant amount of time.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.920]   They saved for years to throw a big fancy party
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.080]   at a fancy venue and spend thousands of dollars
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.840]   so that she could have the wedding of her dreams.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.880]   Now, thankfully, they're still married years later.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.200]   They're doing fine, et cetera.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.800]   But the point is, this entire model is broken,
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.680]   but it's a model that is based upon a false image.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.800]   And so you wanna be careful about the images
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.000]   that you have relating to marriage.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.360]   I simply was using the concept of a wedding ceremony
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:31.280]   and what is practical and how you're kind of forming
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.560]   your idea and your ideal as an obvious example
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.940]   that would then relate over to building your relationship
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.280]   on the subject or on the topic of love,
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.980]   defined as some magical sense of attraction
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.820]   to another person without any context of practical thinking.
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.800]   In the same way that many historical wedding customs
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.600]   are much more sensible than our modern Hollywood-created
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   wedding customs, so are historical marriage practices
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.600]   in many ways much more sensible
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.560]   than our modern Hollywood-created marriage practices.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.520]   Historically, if a couple was going to get married,
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.360]   the community threw the couple a party
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.800]   rather than the couple throwing the community a party.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.120]   Historically, if a couple was going to marry,
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.600]   it was a community affair where the community came together
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:31.440]   to launch the couple successfully into their married life,
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.980]   again, by solemnizing the event, making it a public event
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.840]   so that there was clear indication of who was marrying whom
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.840]   and who was now off of the mate market.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.240]   Mate market sounds pretty terrific, sorry, horrific.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.480]   Who was unavailable, who was taken,
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.400]   who was claimed and was no longer single.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.920]   So there was a public nature to it.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.920]   The community traditions for solemnizing the occasion
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.680]   are continuous from one to another.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.520]   The vows or the commitments are consistent
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.360]   and it's something that the community does.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.320]   And the community comes together,
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.320]   provides the couple with a party,
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.820]   provides the couple with presents
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.840]   and things to start their house, et cetera.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.880]   There's just a great sensibility to it.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.680]   Now, again, I'm not opposed to big fancy weddings.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.700]   Certainly wealthy people throughout history
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.480]   and wealthy fathers have been able to throw
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.400]   and loved to throw their daughters incredible weddings.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.620]   That's wonderful.
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.960]   But that is not the norm for all cultures.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.960]   And as Hollywood has created this magic idea around weddings
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.560]   it has eroded the basic fundamental nature
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.640]   of a wedding ceremony.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.440]   Now let's move to spousal selection.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.540]   If you're going to have the best outcome for your children
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:01.920]   you need to begin by carefully choosing a spouse
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:09.000]   that is going to be a high quality parent for your children.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.960]   On the genetic level, there is a real truth to the idea
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.120]   that the person with whom you conceive a baby,
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:26.320]   that basic genetic DNA will in many cases
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.840]   predict a huge component of the child's life.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.880]   And so we want to look at markers such as health,
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.880]   vitality, strength, size, intelligence, et cetera.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.500]   These genetic markers are fundamentally important.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:51.500]   A significant amount of your child's genetic material,
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.900]   basic genetic code is going to be determined
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.900]   by your mate and your ancestors and your mate's ancestors.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.660]   Recently with my family I've been reading a book
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:10.660]   called Deep Nutrition by Carolyn or Carol,
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.980]   someone or other.
[00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:17.980]   This really interesting, really experienced physician
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.740]   in the state of Hawaii.
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.000]   And I really even enjoyed the book.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.180]   And one of the major points that she makes early on
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:29.180]   in the book is that beauty, what we call physical beauty,
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:35.500]   is strongly tied and connected to markers of health,
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.060]   of physical health.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.980]   In our age we have in many cases taken the idea
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.820]   that physical beauty is only skin deep.
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.660]   We've said, well, that person may be beautiful,
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.620]   but you don't have to be beautiful to be healthy.
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:54.340]   And what the author argues in a way that is convincing
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:58.340]   and persuasive to me is that what we call beauty
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.540]   is a consistent and reliable indicator of physical health.
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.020]   She goes into a really interesting set of research
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.940]   about symmetry and how facial symmetry,
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.220]   which is the primary driving force
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.900]   behind what we call beauty, facial symmetry
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.180]   is an indication of basic health.
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.900]   She makes a super interesting argument
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.700]   in favor of body type.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.280]   Let me look up a quick passage, super fascinating.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.220]   When she's talking about female body type,
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:36.100]   there's this classic idea of a woman's figure
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.940]   being certain forms of a woman's figure
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.620]   being more attractive to men.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.260]   And yet there's actually a strong correlation
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:51.260]   between the body type that a woman has and her basic health.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:57.260]   Here is the quote under section entitled,
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.100]   "Female Body Type and Health."
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.860]   Beauty researchers have divided female body types
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.320]   into four categories.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.840]   In order of declining frequency, they are,
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.620]   banana, apple, pear, and hourglass.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.620]   Several studies performed in 2005
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.860]   showed that apple-shaped women with short waists
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.060]   and narrow hips had almost double the mortality rates
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.700]   of women with more generous curves.
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.100]   Why would that be?
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.820]   Voluptuousness is an indication
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.700]   of healthy female sexual dimorphism,
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.060]   while a lack of voluptuousness indicates a problem.
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.860]   Normally, the hips and bust develop during puberty
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.760]   as a result of a healthy surge in sex hormones.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.500]   These developments involve expansion of the pelvic bones
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.120]   along with the deposition of fat
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.620]   and glandular tissue within the breasts.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.080]   But women whose genetics are such
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.380]   that their spines are abnormally short
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.220]   or their hormonal surge less pronounced,
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.300]   or whose diet is such that it interferes
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.720]   with the body's response to hormones,
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.060]   end up with boxier figures.
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.300]   If they're thin, they'll end up as bananas.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.340]   If they put on weight,
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.940]   it gets distributed in a more masculine pattern
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.380]   in the belly, on the neck, and around the upper arms,
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.940]   and they'll become apples.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.840]   Today, after three generations of trans fat consumption,
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.580]   which interferes with hormone expression, C chapter seven,
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.520]   and with daily infusions of sugar,
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.780]   which interferes with hormone receptivity, C chapter nine,
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.380]   hourglass figures have become something of a rarity.
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.700]   According to a 2005 study commissioned by Alva Products,
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.800]   a manufacturer of designer's mannequins,
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.740]   less than 10% of women today
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.660]   develop the voluptuous curves universally recognized
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.880]   as the defining features of a healthy
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.060]   and attractive female figure.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.660]   In a world of apples, pears, and bananas,
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.860]   writer Nancy Etkoff has suggested
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.880]   that the most beautiful among us are genetic freaks.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.920]   It's not an insult.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.740]   She is merely referencing the statistical improbability
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.460]   of someone growing up to look like,
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.780]   to use her example, Cindy Crawford.
[00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.780]   But the suggestion seems to capture
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.420]   Etkoff's general thesis accurately.
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.680]   When a stunningly beautiful person is born,
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.460]   it's largely the result of genetic chance.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.340]   These select few, the thinking goes,
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.080]   play the genetic lottery and won big.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.080]   But I couldn't disagree more.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.260]   Why would biology program us to be hot for genetic freaks?
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.900]   It seems to me far more probable
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.720]   that we are attracted to beautiful bodies
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.460]   because they advertise superlative health.
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.940]   In keeping with this idea,
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.460]   researchers studying the effect
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.120]   of these four female body types on lifespan
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.800]   find that women with the most attractive
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.340]   of the four body types, the hourglass,
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.640]   not only live the longest, they also live better.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.440]   Statistics consistently show that having a longer,
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.860]   slimmer waist, and more womanly hips
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.600]   correlates with reduced diagnoses of infertility,
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.060]   osteoporosis, cancer, cognitive problems,
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.620]   abdominal aneurysms, diabetes and its complications,
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.120]   and more.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.740]   And of course, all of those are cited sources
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.020]   that you're welcome to look up if you're interested.
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.300]   So the book is called "Deep Nutrition"
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.060]   by Katherine Shanahan, MD.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.380]   And it's a fascinating book.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.140]   And so the comments that I'm making are simply that
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.180]   when you are selecting a spouse,
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.860]   it's important that you think about the basic genetic
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.200]   makeup of that person.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.260]   And don't be ashamed to pursue someone who is beautiful.
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.440]   Don't be ashamed to pursue someone who is healthy.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.060]   Don't be ashamed to pursue someone who is strong,
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:32.060]   who is vigorous, who is vitality, who expresses vitality.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:36.140]   Because these basic things are going to be passed along
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.860]   to your children.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.020]   This is also going to affect everything from,
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.460]   so your child's basic health,
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.940]   and it's going to affect your child's basic intelligence.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:52.140]   In our modern age, which is very cognitively demanding,
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.860]   you wanna be very thoughtful about marrying someone
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.980]   who reflects your personal values
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.660]   and your own personal levels of intelligence.
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.260]   This is fundamentally important, at least in my experience,
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.260]   for your satisfaction and happiness in life.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:13.440]   I would have a very hard time being in a relationship
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.880]   with a woman who was not my intellectual evil,
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.940]   evil, (laughs)
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.640]   my intellectual equal,
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.240]   because it would just be very hard for me to relate.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.180]   And so if my wife didn't understand my little quirky jokes,
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.200]   if she couldn't discuss the way that I wanna live
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.980]   and the ideas and the abstract ideas and concepts
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.480]   that I think about on a continual basis with me,
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.860]   I would find my relationship with her very unfulfilling.
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:44.400]   But one of the side factors is that your genetic,
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.240]   your basic intelligence and your mate's basic intelligence
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.760]   are gonna be passed along to your children.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.240]   Now, this is, I think, increasingly a major challenge
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.700]   in our modern society.
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.780]   I started thinking about this issue myself
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.040]   for the first time years ago
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.000]   when I read Charles Murray's excellent book
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.600]   called "Coming Apart,"
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.320]   in which he analyzes the culture of the United States
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.200]   and some of the things that are contributing
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.020]   to this weird, basically two stories
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.720]   that we have in American culture.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.920]   And it's hard to summarize the entire book
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.760]   in a few sentences.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.080]   But in that book, he talks about
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:28.200]   the increases in cognitive homogamy.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:33.200]   And so homogamy, the word, it's not commonly used,
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.420]   but homogamy refers to the interbreeding of individuals
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.480]   with like characteristics.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.840]   Educational homogamy occurs when individuals
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.440]   with similar educations have children.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.940]   Cognitive homogamy occurs when individuals
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.120]   with similar cognitive ability have children.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.680]   Let me read an excerpt here
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.040]   because it'll put this into focus
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.040]   in terms of how things like basic intelligence
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.700]   are transmitted generationally
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.980]   and what this can and is increasingly resulting in
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.240]   in our modern society,
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.760]   from a section called "The Increase in Cognitive Homogamy."
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.080]   "Before the age of mobility,
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.960]   "people commonly married someone from the same town
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.500]   "or from the same neighborhood of an urban area.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.040]   "The events that threw people together
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.540]   "seldom had anything to do
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.380]   "specifically with cognitive ability.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.200]   "Similar cognitive ability was a source of compatibility
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.160]   "between a young man and a young woman,
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.740]   "and some degree of cognitive homogamy existed,
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.960]   "but it was a haphazard process.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.520]   "Meanwhile, educational homogamy was high
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.640]   "because hardly anyone went to college.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.520]   "In large proportions of married couples,
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.680]   "both had less than a high school education
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.060]   "or both had a high school diploma.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.720]   "As the proportion of college graduates increased,
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.140]   "so did the possibilities
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.880]   "for greater educational homogamy at the top.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.240]   "As college graduates found,
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.080]   "they had more potential marriage partners
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.280]   "who were also college graduates.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.680]   "Drawing on the extensive technical literature and the CPS,"
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.720]   which is, I forget what the acronym stands for,
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.160]   basically a large, standardized,
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.600]   continually collected body of survey data,
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.840]   "sociologists Christine Schwartz and Robert Mayer
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.920]   "examined trends in, quote, assortative marriage,

[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.280]   "They found that homogamy has increased
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.560]   "at both ends of the educational scale.

[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.040]   "to marry other high school dropouts.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.680]   "For our purposes," which is trying to understand
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.280]   how the new upper class came to be,

[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.400]   "may be seen in a simple measure.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.000]   "In 1960, just 3% of American couples
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.680]   "both had a college degree.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.300]   "By 2010, that proportion stood at 25%.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.100]   "The change was so large that it was a major contributor
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.180]   "to the creation of a new class all by itself.
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.180]   "But increased educational homogamy
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.280]   "had another consequence that the academic literature
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.320]   "on homogamy avoids mentioning.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.320]   "Increased educational homogamy
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.780]   "inevitably means increased cognitive homogamy.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.000]   "A college education, starting with admission

[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.200]   "and that in turn requires logical mathematical ability
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.920]   "in roughly the top decile of the population.

[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.060]   "To graduate means passing all these tests

[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:57.300]   "implies a mean IQ for people attaining that level
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.340]   "that has been remarkably stable among whites
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.020]   "at least since the beginning of the 1980s."
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.360]   And here the author goes and shares a paragraph
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.700]   on why he is limiting this data to whites only.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.120]   Most of the book is whites only data.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.680]   He has an appendix on non-white data,
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.440]   but whites only data avoids a lot of the racial issues
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.760]   in America over the course of the 20th century
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.160]   and gives for better analysis.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.800]   Then he presents a chart showing how basically
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.080]   the IQ levels for degree attainment
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.140]   are very, very obviously driven
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:35.140]   by the height of educational attainment, right?
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.640]   For the mean IQ for persons completing
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.480]   no more than no degree in the year 1982 to '89 is 88.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.960]   2005, it's 87.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.320]   High school diploma, 99, 2005, 99.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.160]   Associate's degree, 105 and 104.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.320]   Bachelor's degree, 113, 113.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.340]   Master's degree, 117, 117.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:59.920]   And then PhD, LLD, MD or DDS, 126 and 124.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.140]   The stability of the scores over the three decades
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.800]   from the 1980s through the 2000s is remarkable
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.920]   considering that the number of bachelor's degrees
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.000]   expressed as a percentage of 22 year olds
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   increased from 22% in 1981 to 37% in 2008.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   But the country was also becoming steadily more efficient
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.480]   at getting the best students into college over that period
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.100]   so that the greater size of the college population
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.880]   didn't mean a markedly less able population.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.600]   If the mean IQs at the higher levels
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.480]   of educational attainment have been stable,
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.040]   then the growth of two degree couples
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:36.120]   has meant, inevitably, greater cognitive homogamy at the top.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.480]   But that's just the beginning.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.060]   The college sorting machine has also been at work.
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.280]   College brings people together at the time of life
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.760]   when young adults are beginning to look around
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.880]   for marriage partners.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.400]   And the college sorting machine brings the highest IQ
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.280]   young women and young men together
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.360]   in the most prestigious schools.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.360]   As if that weren't enough,
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.600]   graduate school adds another layer of sorting
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.880]   so that the brilliant young woman
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.920]   who went to a state university goes to Harvard Law School
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.020]   where she is brought into the elite pool.
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.140]   For the prospective members of the new upper class
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.660]   who don't find a marriage partner as an undergraduate
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.600]   or at grad school, the names of the schools they attended
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.460]   give them badges that signal their status
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:12.900]   to prospective mates.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.400]   The substance of their education also sorts them
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.600]   into occupations that increase the likelihood
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.120]   that they will eventually marry people
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.260]   with similar characteristics.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.280]   So it's not just that college graduates
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.920]   are likely to marry college graduates,
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.840]   but that graduates from elite colleges
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.440]   are likely to marry other graduates from elite colleges.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.920]   Back in the days when Harvard men and Wellesley women
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.800]   were more likely to be rich than to be especially smart,
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.480]   this meant that money was more likely to marry money.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.480]   In an era when they are both almost certainly
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.960]   in the top centiles of the IQ distribution,
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.640]   it means that very smart is more likely to marry very smart.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.200]   Goes on and talks a little bit about shared culture,
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.000]   how cognitive ability is just kind of a marker
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.160]   for having a shared culture.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.540]   And then we read this section here.
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.040]   Transmission of cognitive ability to the next generation.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.200]   As I read this, pay careful attention
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.480]   to the comments on the durability of wealth.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.620]   Another consequence of increased educational
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:12.520]   and cognitive homogamy is the increased tenacity
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:17.520]   of the elite in maintaining its status across generations.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.860]   The adage, shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:24.100]   in three generations grew out of an observed reality.
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.600]   If the children and grandchildren are only average
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.220]   in their own abilities, money from a fortune one
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.260]   in the first generation won't keep them
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.740]   at the top of the heap.
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.040]   When the parents are passing cognitive ability
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.540]   along with the money, the staying power
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.340]   of the elite across generations increases.
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.020]   Specific numbers can be attached to such statements.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.540]   The stability of the average IQs for different levels
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.040]   of educational attainment over time means
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.740]   that we can predict the average IQs of children of parents
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.940]   with different combinations of education.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.960]   And we can also predict where the next generation
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.460]   of the smartest children is going to come from.
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:01.220]   On average, children are neither as smart
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.300]   nor as dumb as their parents.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.620]   They are closer to the middle.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.920]   This tendency is called regression to the mean.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.360]   It exists independently of genes.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.180]   Regression to the mean is a function
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.740]   of the empirically observed statistical relationships
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:16.840]   between the tested IQs of parents and children.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.420]   Given the parameters in the note on page 366,
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.520]   the expected value of the IQ of a grownup offspring
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.760]   is 40% toward the population mean
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.180]   from the parent's midpoint IQ.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.840]   Suppose we have four white couples
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.400]   with the same level of education,
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:35.400]   plugging in the average IQs for those levels of education
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.740]   as given in table 2.1.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.940]   I added a fifth couple who both have degrees
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.460]   from elite colleges with a midpoint IQ of 135.
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.740]   Here is what we can expect as mean IQs
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.340]   of the children of these couples.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.900]   Parents' education, two high school dropouts,
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.520]   expected IQ of the child, 94.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.460]   Two high school diplomas, expected IQ of the child, 101.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.580]   Two college degrees and no more,
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.660]   expected IQ of the child, 109.
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.420]   Two graduate degrees, expected IQ of the child, 116.
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.020]   Two degrees from an elite college,
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.800]   expected IQ of the child, 121.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.900]   These represent important differences in the resources
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.740]   that members of the next generation take
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.780]   to the preservation of their legacy.
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.460]   Consider first a college graduate
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.460]   who marries a high school graduate,
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.580]   each with the average cognitive ability
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:27.020]   for their educational level, 113 and 99 respectively.
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.860]   Their expected midpoint IQ is 106.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.660]   Suppose they have built a small business,
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.060]   been highly successful,
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.560]   and leave $5 million to their son.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.780]   If their son has the expected IQ of a little less than 105,
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.920]   he will have only about a 50% chance of completing college,
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.520]   even assuming that he tries to go to college.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.860]   Maybe he inherited extraordinary energy
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.440]   and determination from his parents, which would help.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.080]   But those qualities regress to the mean as well.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.560]   Shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.380]   is a likely scenario for the progeny
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.220]   of that successful example.
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.520]   Compare that situation with the one facing the son
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.520]   of two parents who both graduated from elite schools.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:08.220]   If he has exactly the expected IQ of 121,
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:11.020]   he has more than an 80% chance of getting a degree
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.440]   if he goes to college.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.140]   These percentages are not a matter of statistical theory.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.100]   They are based on the empirical experience
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.700]   of both the 1979 and 1997 cohorts
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.260]   of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:27.540]   If you had an IQ of 105 or one of 121 and entered college,
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.700]   those are the probabilities that you ever got a degree.
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.220]   In addition to those differing chances of graduation
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.260]   are qualitative differences between young people
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.980]   with IQs of 105 and 121.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.340]   First, the reasons that someone with an IQ of 105
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.900]   doesn't finish college probably include
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.740]   serious academic difficulties with the work,
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.320]   whereas the reasons a person with an IQ of 121
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.480]   doesn't finish college almost certainly involve
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.780]   motivation or self-discipline.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.180]   No one with an IQ of 121 has to drop out of college
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.300]   because he can't pass the courses.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.140]   Second, there is a qualitative difference
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.580]   in the range of occupations open to those two young persons.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.480]   The one with an accurately measured IQ of 105
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.240]   cannot expect to be successful
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.860]   in any of the prestigious professions
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:14.500]   that are screened for IQ by their educational requirements,
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.460]   for example, medicine, law, engineering, academia.
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.220]   It is unlikely that he can even complete
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.020]   those educational requirements.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.980]   Someone with an accurately measured IQ of 121
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.920]   can succeed in any of them if his mathematical
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.820]   and verbal talents are both strong
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.940]   or succeed in the ones geared to his talents
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.060]   if there is an imbalance between mathematical
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.860]   and verbal ability.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.940]   Now, think in terms of an entire cohort of children.
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.980]   Where will the next generation of children
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.540]   with exceptional cognitive ability come from?
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.780]   For purposes of illustration,
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:47.700]   let's say that exceptionally high cognitive ability
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.300]   means the top five centiles
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.540]   of the next generation of white children.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.860]   More than a quarter of their parents
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.820]   may be expected to have a midpoint IQ of more than 125.
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.380]   Another quarter may be expected to have
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:02.000]   midpoint parental IQ of 117 to 125.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.680]   The third quarter may be expected to have
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.120]   midpoint parental IQ of 108 to 117.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.860]   That leaves one quarter who will be the children of parents
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.860]   with midpoint parental IQ of less than 108.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.260]   Only about 14% of that top five centiles of children
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.140]   are expected to come from the entire bottom half
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.900]   of the distribution of white parents.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.020]   Therein lies the explanation for that startling statistic
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.620]   I reported earlier about SAT scores.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:31.740]   In 2010, 87% of the students with 700 plus scores
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.600]   in critical reading or mathematics
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.340]   had a parent with a college degree,
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:39.000]   and 57% had a parent with a graduate degree.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.880]   Those percentages could have been predicted pretty closely
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   just by knowing the facts about the IQs
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.980]   associated with different educational levels
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.340]   and the correlation between parental and child IQ.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.260]   They could have been predicted
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.140]   without making any theoretical assumptions
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.980]   about the roles of nature and nurture
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.820]   in transmitting cognitive ability,
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.340]   and without knowing anything about the family incomes
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.260]   of those SAT test takers,
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.580]   how many test preparation courses their children took,
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.900]   whether they went to private schools
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.660]   or how ingenious the educational toys in the household were
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.140]   when they were toddlers.
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.780]   In an age when the majority of parents
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.120]   in the top five centiles of cognitive ability
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.840]   worked as farmers, shopkeepers, blue collar workers,
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.040]   and housewives, a situation that necessarily prevailed
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.100]   a century ago, given the occupational
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.500]   and educational distributions during the early 1900s,
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.740]   these relationships between the cognitive ability
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.160]   of parents and children had no ominous implications.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.320]   Today, when the exceptionally qualified
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.600]   have been so efficiently drawn
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.760]   into the ranks of the upper middle class,
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.640]   and when they are so often married to people
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.400]   with the same ability and background, they do.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.520]   In fact, the implications are even more ominous
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.000]   than I just described, because none of the numbers I used
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.120]   to illustrate the transmission of cognitive ability
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.840]   to the next generation incorporated the effects
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.320]   of the increased educational homogamy of recent decades.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.000]   In any case, the bottom line is not subject to refutation.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.900]   Highly disproportionate numbers
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.960]   of exceptionally able children in the next generation
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.240]   will come from parents in the upper middle class,
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.960]   and more specifically, from parents
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.660]   who are already part of the broad elite.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.660]   (sighs)
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:17.100]   One sidebar that was included that I skipped over earlier
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.580]   in the text that's important.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.980]   Which comes first, education or IQ?
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:25.780]   Educational attainment is correlated with IQ,
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.660]   but education does not have much effect on IQ
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.240]   after the child enters elementary school.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.460]   By that, I do not mean that the absence
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.140]   of any education after age six wouldn't make a difference,
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.380]   nor that exceptions do not exist.
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.820]   Rather, I mean that if 1,000 children
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.700]   are administered a good IQ test at age six,
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.940]   and those children then attend a wide variety
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:47.940]   of elementary and secondary schools,
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.340]   their IQs at age 18 will be very similar
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.120]   to what they were at age six,
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.220]   and statistical analysis will not show
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:57.140]   that the children who went to the expensive private schools
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.900]   got an IQ boost as a result.
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.300]   This finding goes back to the famous Coleman Report
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.820]   in the 1960s.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:07.140]   Scholars still debate whether additional years of education
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.540]   are associated with increments in general mental ability
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.140]   or just increments in test scores,
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:14.160]   but no one contends that education routinely transforms
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:19.120]   average children into intellectually gifted adults.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:25.220]   The point that I want you to draw is
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:31.660]   basic, the basic genetic makeup of the person
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.280]   with whom you choose to procreate
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.120]   is going to have a significant effect
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:41.640]   on the long-term results
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.720]   that your children experience in life.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:48.080]   In a perfect world, you would marry somebody
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.000]   who is exceedingly beautiful, exceedingly strong,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   exceedingly healthy, and exceedingly smart.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.500]   In a perfect world, you yourself would be
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:00.160]   exceedingly beautiful, exceedingly strong,
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:03.120]   exceedingly healthy, and exceedingly smart.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.480]   Now, none of us chose the genetic makeup
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.660]   that we personally enjoy,
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.520]   but we all have a responsibility
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.880]   to maximize our own gifts and abilities.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.280]   We have a responsibility to maximize it.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.960]   I was sick the day after Christmas,
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:31.240]   in bed for a day, and every time I get sick,
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:35.120]   I just reflect on the fact of how difficult it is
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.040]   to do anything productive when you don't feel well.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.160]   And one of the great gifts that I have been given
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.560]   has been just enjoying robust personal health.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.160]   For all of my challenges and shortcomings,
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.920]   I've always generally enjoyed good personal health.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.040]   I've generally felt good.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.080]   I've generally lived most of my life pain-free
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.440]   and pretty well cared for.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:00.020]   When I compare, and so when I'm sick,
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:03.320]   I'm just shocked at how much of my own personal success
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.040]   in life has been due to this factor
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.080]   that is significantly out of control.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.640]   I do my best to maximize my health.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.440]   I try to be wise with my decisions, as we all do, right?
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.800]   But at the end of the day, a significant amount
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.320]   of my genetic heritage and my robust personal health,
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.860]   I didn't do anything for it, right?
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.080]   I didn't deserve it.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.240]   It's just my genetic lot in life.
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.920]   And same thing with intelligence,
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.740]   with physical attractiveness, et cetera.
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.880]   None of us did anything to deserve where we are,
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.860]   but we do have a responsibility
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.260]   to maximize those gifts that we have.
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:45.240]   When you're choosing a mate, a spouse,
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:50.520]   I believe that is a time in which you should be,
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.460]   and you have every right to be, perfectly selfish.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:00.680]   I believe that marriage is a permanent institution.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:06.720]   When my wife and I said, "I will," to each other,
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.960]   I signed away my life with no escape.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.480]   I said, "I will have you and hold you, keep you,
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.720]   "in sickness and in health, for better or worse,
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.500]   "no matter what, in poverty and in wealth,
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.360]   "no matter what, till death do us part."
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.600]   That is a huge commitment.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:27.080]   That commitment is a necessary precondition

[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:52.000]   and let's talk about some of the sociological factors.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.560]   As you'll hear as I continue in this podcast episode,
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:03.120]   in discussing the care and nurturing of a baby,
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.120]   care and nurturing of children, et cetera,
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.920]   what will quickly become apparent
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.520]   is that questions of character,
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.720]   questions of personality,
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.760]   questions of virtue,
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.960]   questions of psychology,
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:21.280]   questions of worldview,
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.520]   of religion and theology,
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:30.240]   these questions will be exceedingly important
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.540]   in the care and nurture of your children.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:36.240]   One of the comments I'll make in a little bit
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.160]   when we talk about babies is the importance
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:41.760]   of babies being surrounded by nothing but love.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.200]   Love and caresses
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:49.960]   and gentleness and kindness, et cetera.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.960]   If you marry somebody who is loud,
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.600]   who is harsh,
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.280]   who doesn't know how to express love and care,
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.840]   who doesn't know how to cuddle a baby,
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.220]   who doesn't have the personal patience
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:08.640]   to deal with a crying baby without lashing out
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.000]   and getting frustrated and angry,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.360]   then your hopes and dreams
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.560]   for your children's long-term future
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.120]   are going to be significantly harmed.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:19.040]   And so you wanna be very, very careful
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:24.040]   about the character of the person that you are marrying.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.800]   You wanna be very careful about the character
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:30.000]   of the person with whom you are procreating.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.760]   Because if you have a child
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.720]   with somebody who is of low moral character
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.280]   and you're fundamentally,
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:42.520]   you're running from behind,
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.180]   so what do you wanna look for?
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.160]   Well, you make your own list,
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:49.000]   but I think that of utmost importance
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   is basic issues of virtue and of character.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.680]   You want to be in a relationship with somebody
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.160]   who has high moral character
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.640]   in all of its fullest expressions.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.440]   You want someone who is patient.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.080]   You want someone who is kind.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:06.880]   You want someone who is exceedingly self-disciplined.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:11.880]   You want somebody who is compassionate,
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.860]   loving, tenderhearted.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.020]   All of these character qualities that we can go through
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:21.120]   need to be reflected in your prospective spouse.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.420]   If you were to go through a list of virtues
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:24.760]   and character qualities,
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:29.340]   what you'll see is every single one of them,
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.940]   if present and in its strongest form,
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.500]   can have a very positive impact
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.220]   and influence on your children.
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.700]   And each one of them, if absent
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.100]   or only present in a very weak form,
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.540]   can have a negative impact.
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:51.160]   Think about assertiveness.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:57.120]   If you are in a relationship with someone
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.880]   who is not assertive,
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.020]   then your child may grow up
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.660]   to be the dominant force in a household
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:07.100]   rather than being the submissive one in a household
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:10.460]   and understanding very clearly his role in society
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.380]   due to the assertiveness of a parent.
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:13.700]   Or cleanliness.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:17.940]   If you are in a relationship with someone who is unclean
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.200]   or who is slovenly in his or her manner,
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.240]   his or her dress, his or her deportment,
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:27.100]   his or her way he or she keeps his or her house,
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.540]   then this can negatively impact it.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.420]   If a child is surrounded by a,
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.900]   grows up in a slovenly hovel,
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.580]   then that child is not going to achieve his potential.
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:39.780]   He's gonna have to work to escape it
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:42.700]   rather than growing up in cleanliness
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.420]   and in carefulness, right?
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:47.820]   Helpfulness or moderation or modesty or orderliness
[00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:51.460]   or purposefulness or gentleness or generosity.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.940]   Again, go through a list of character qualities
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:57.020]   and what you'll see is that all of these are important.
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:00.780]   They're gonna be important for the functioning of a parent
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:04.780]   and they're gonna be important for the example
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:08.240]   that is gonna be set in front of your child.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:12.940]   If a child has a positive example set of strong virtue
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.420]   and strong moral foundation,
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:18.580]   then that child will naturally absorb the idea
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.780]   that this is the normal way of living.
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:23.940]   And then that child will be as one who stands
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:26.100]   on the shoulders of the giants before him.
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.820]   But if the child has a strongly negative example,
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:32.780]   that child has to go through this long
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:36.620]   and circuitous pathway of systematically discarding
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:39.380]   the negative example to which he's been exposed
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:41.620]   for all of his formative years
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:45.140]   and then surrounding himself with positive examples.
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:49.000]   So all of these things matter, they matter hugely.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   And even a person of the highest virtue and character
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:00.020]   is going to be tested in the crucible of babies and children.
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:02.780]   I remember distinctly an experience that I had
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.100]   when we had our first baby.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:08.620]   I always had, I continue to have and have always had
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.600]   a fairly high opinion of myself,
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.540]   a strong sense of self-confidence.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:16.020]   I know where my strengths are, where my weaknesses are.
[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:20.220]   And I am generally a fairly patient man, et cetera.
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.420]   But I remember so much when we had our first child
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.300]   and there was a time in which he was just crying
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.100]   and crying and crying and my wife and I were tired
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.740]   and were worn out and up all night and no sleep
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:34.340]   and trying to figure out what is wrong with this baby
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.620]   and is he physically hurt?
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.200]   Is there something that we're doing wrong?
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.900]   We're inexperienced parents, of course, et cetera.
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.460]   And one of the things, by the way,
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:45.660]   that happens in your parenting journey
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:49.500]   is your tolerance for something like crying increases.
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:52.620]   Obviously, none of us want a child to cry,
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.980]   but I remember, or I see sometimes,
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:59.500]   if a single person without children is around
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.940]   and your baby's crying, like the person just like starts,
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.740]   especially men, they start shifting their chairs.
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:04.820]   They're like, "I don't know what to do."
[00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:06.820]   And they're super uncomfortable.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.740]   And as a parent, after a while, you just learn,
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.900]   sometimes children cry and you can't fix it.
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:15.260]   And at least if he's crying, it means he's not dying.
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:16.080]   Right?
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:16.920]   You're okay, okay.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.760]   Crying is annoying, but he's crying because he's overtired.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.860]   We'll be home in 15 minutes.
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:21.940]   He can just cry for 15 minutes.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.020]   We'll get him in his bed, he'll go to sleep, et cetera.
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.700]   But that takes time to learn.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.300]   And so I remember our first child,
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.740]   there was a point in time where I was so frustrated.
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:33.660]   I was holding my baby and all of a sudden,
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:37.020]   I was swept by this overwhelming urge
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:40.320]   to just like frustrated to shake my baby.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.700]   And it scared me to death.
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:44.940]   'Cause all of a sudden I realized,
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.820]   oh, that's why shaken baby syndrome or whatever is a thing.
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:51.160]   Like this is what happens.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:54.140]   You're so filled with frustration and anger.
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:57.740]   And like, you're at the end of your rope and you're tired
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.140]   and you can't fix it.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:00.780]   And you just wanna fix it that you're just like,
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:03.420]   ah, you wanna just lash out.
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.460]   Now I understand why people shake their babies.
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.660]   And I didn't for the record, I didn't.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:09.360]   I put him down in his crib.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:10.980]   I walked out, I closed the door.
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.700]   I walked to the end of the house.
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:15.580]   I sat down, breathed for a few minutes
[00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:17.900]   and then went back five minutes later and started again
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:19.780]   and calmed him, soothed him, et cetera.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:21.860]   But I just vividly remember,
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.020]   it's those times when you come face to face
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.660]   with your own wretchedness as a human being.
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:29.220]   And you realize, wow,
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:33.580]   if I didn't have the self-control that I have,
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.860]   I could have just done something really horrific
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.660]   and harmed my baby.
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.940]   And he's totally innocent in it.
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.980]   And so those things matter.
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:45.460]   They matter hugely, hugely.
[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:50.020]   Now, a couple of important comments specifically to men.
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:52.820]   One of the things that you need to think
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:55.420]   very carefully about,
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.220]   if you want your children,
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.000]   if you desire to have children
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.540]   and you want your children to flourish,
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:07.180]   you need to very carefully choose a woman
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:11.340]   based upon her qualities and her abilities
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.880]   and her aptitude for motherliness.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:19.580]   One of the great challenges that we face in our modern era,
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:23.660]   on the backside of four waves of feminism,
[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:27.980]   is that very few women are ever encouraged
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:32.980]   to develop abilities, skills, qualities,
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:38.240]   or appreciation even of motherly characteristics.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:42.480]   Most young women in our modern Western societies
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:46.880]   are being systematically trained for careers
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:50.680]   in business, in medicine, et cetera,
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.800]   rather than as mothers.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.280]   And so this makes it very challenging
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.440]   to distinguish and navigate
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:03.060]   between a woman who's going to be a good mother
[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:06.360]   versus a woman who's going to be a great career woman.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:10.260]   I see a little bit of a change
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:15.260]   where I see that there are broad swaths of women
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:19.520]   who are wishing that they could have more
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:24.100]   of the old-fashioned motherly style of living
[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.440]   and are feeling frustrated
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.160]   with how they've been basically shoehorned
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:32.160]   into modern business-making, money-making careers.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:36.120]   But it is very challenging because a lot of times,
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:39.440]   the women who are the most successful
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:44.440]   in the modern business world make the worst mothers.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:49.040]   And the women who are probably the best mothers
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.320]   are probably not going to be very successful
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.420]   in the business world.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.600]   It's important that you think about this
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:01.600]   and think about what you want as early in life as possible.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:08.040]   If you desire to be in a relationship with a career woman,
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:10.240]   feel free, it's your life.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:13.880]   If you desire to be in a relationship with a mother,
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:17.560]   it's also your life, and you can choose that.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:22.880]   On this topic, I myself feel like I dodged a bullet
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.880]   when it came to choosing my wife.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.320]   The reason I feel that way is I was not confident
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:32.360]   when I was 20 years old that I wanted a woman
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:36.280]   who was willing to be a great mother and a great wife.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:41.280]   I was so infected with the modern kind of feminist worldview
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.840]   that I thought it was discriminatory for me to say
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:47.040]   that I would want a woman who would be a good mother.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:48.680]   I wouldn't have gone out and done that.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.960]   And there were several women that I was interested in
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.320]   who, in hindsight, it's now blindingly obvious to me
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:57.920]   that it would have been a horrific relationship
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.480]   for me personally because they were very career-driven.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.800]   There were three different girls that I was interested in,
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.400]   all three of whom went on to become doctors.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.720]   And if I had ever ended up in a marriage relationship
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.520]   with those women, it would have been very difficult for us
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.480]   because their careers were very important to them.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.960]   And yet, with my interest in traveling the world
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.680]   and living a free lifestyle, et cetera,
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:26.200]   I would have found it difficult to be married to them
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.720]   because of the many compromises.
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.880]   Now, I'm not casting any aspersions on them.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.920]   I think I haven't, I'm not in touch with any of them.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.120]   I know that at least a couple of them are mothers now,
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.440]   and I'm sure they're wonderful mothers, et cetera.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.280]   But their life decisions have,
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.880]   and the importance of their careers
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.160]   set them on a different track.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.240]   And that track would have been frustrating to me.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.480]   Back to what I said a little bit ago,
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.560]   when you're choosing a spouse,
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.520]   you should be completely and entirely selfish.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.320]   And you should be thinking about your vision
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.680]   for your children, and you should choose the best mother
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.400]   that you can for your children.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.080]   My wife and I, prior to being married,
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:11.120]   it was not like we sat down and kind of had this,
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.480]   you know, tremendous, you know,
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:17.240]   long-term plan that we were gonna go
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.720]   and have five children.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.280]   Kind of just emerged naturally.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.160]   But in hindsight, with experience,
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.480]   I can now see that one of the reasons
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.320]   it emerged naturally is because we had
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.760]   a high degree of compatibility on some of these issues.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.360]   My wife was working, she had a job, et cetera,
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.240]   but she wasn't super career-oriented.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.680]   She wasn't trying to earn a million dollars
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.640]   as, you know, a lady boss.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.120]   She was working 'cause she needed to work,
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.160]   and she was happy to be married to me.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.080]   And in hindsight, it's one of the things
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.920]   that I appreciate the most about her
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:50.600]   is that she can be fully focused on being a mother.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.600]   And I consider that a major asset.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.560]   As you'll hear when I talk about some of the things
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.320]   that you can do with babies and children,
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:02.560]   one of the most important things that you need is time.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.560]   And you especially need time from your children's mother.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.240]   And so if you are attracted to somebody
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.160]   who expresses motherly qualities,
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.680]   or if you're attracted to somebody who has developed skills
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.760]   and ability and knowledge and prepared herself
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.600]   to be an effective mother,
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:27.960]   that's a hugely important thing for you to consider.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.600]   And if you want children,
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:33.180]   and you want your children to be raised well,
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:37.640]   the choice of the mother and her character qualities,
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.120]   her inclinations, her personality,
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.760]   is going to be a choice that you cannot
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.320]   overcome, meaning you cannot go beyond that basic choice.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.760]   You are going to succeed or fail to the degree
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.860]   that she possesses those character qualities that you need.
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:01.400]   Now, I want to speak to my female listeners.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:07.120]   The exact same thing applies to you.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.480]   If you're going to be in a relationship with a man
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:13.680]   and you are thinking and caring about the long-term success
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.560]   and future of your children,
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.400]   you need to be exceedingly discriminatory
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.960]   around choosing a man who's going to be
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.880]   a high-quality, capable father.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:30.000]   You need to be very, very careful
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.400]   about who you conceive children with,
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:36.400]   and make sure that you are only conceiving children
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.400]   with somebody who is going to be a world-class father.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.640]   Because if you wind up raising a child by yourself,
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.680]   your child will never be as successful
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.920]   as he otherwise could be if he were raised
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:54.320]   by a mother and a father.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:00.840]   A child who doesn't have a strong, virtuous father
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:07.720]   in his life is going to begin his life completely handicapped.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:11.400]   And that will express itself more and more
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.840]   as the years go by.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.880]   And so your choice of a man of high moral character
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.560]   and integrity is exceedingly important.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.200]   Your choice of somebody who is going to provide you
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.200]   with the lifestyle that you want is exceedingly important.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.800]   One of the conclusions I've had for years
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.120]   and have proven again over recent weeks
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:37.080]   is if you're going to be a committed parent
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.080]   with young children,
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.120]   I do not believe it is possible to do that
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.120]   as well as it could be if you are trying to also earn money.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.040]   I am a very, very skilled father
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.400]   on the day-to-day functioning of my household.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.520]   And when we have a new baby, as I'll talk about in,
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.480]   I guess at this point I should probably
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.160]   do a separate episode,
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.000]   but when we have a new baby, my wife has one job,
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.320]   be with baby, that's all.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.520]   And so I'm running the household and I'm very good at it.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.440]   I am very skilled at it.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.800]   It actually annoys me when people make jokes
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.800]   about men being incapable of washing their towels
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.840]   and cooking and whatnot.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.800]   I'm very skilled at it.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:22.200]   Even with my skill, I find it very hard to create the time
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.440]   to sit down and do something as simple
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.400]   as recording a podcast for you,
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.080]   even though I know what I want to say,
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:32.080]   because the demands of young children are continuous.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:37.800]   And so if you want to be a full-time mother
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.120]   and be able to pour into your children,
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.600]   you better choose a guy who can make enough money
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.680]   to support you and who wants that,
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.560]   and who's willing to do that with a happy attitude.
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.600]   You better be careful of choosing somebody
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.720]   who's gonna be patient with you,
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.920]   who's gonna be patient with you
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.240]   when you are your most vulnerable.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.480]   One of the times when a woman is in her most vulnerable state
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.440]   is during childbirth and immediately after
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:06.240]   when she's recovering, exceedingly vulnerable.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.700]   And so you need to choose somebody
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.520]   who's gonna provide for you, who's gonna care for you,
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.640]   who's gonna protect you, et cetera.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.960]   So you must be very, very careful
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:18.560]   and very, very discriminatory in choosing someone
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:23.560]   who is the highest quality for you in your relationship.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:28.800]   Don't succumb to the idea that the only thing
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.840]   that matters is the feels.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.640]   Don't succumb to the idea that the only thing that matters
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.220]   is whether your heart goes pit or pat when he looks at you.
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:41.060]   That's important in some measure,
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:45.640]   but it's not in any way the kind of thing
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:48.860]   that's going to survive the decades.
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.800]   And you want something that's going to last.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.420]   And if you want your children to succeed,
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:59.300]   you can't just depend upon the basic genetic material.
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:02.820]   Your goal is not to go out and find a sperm donor
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:05.380]   who is tall, dark, and handsome and has a high IQ.
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:11.160]   You need somebody who has those basic qualities,
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:16.160]   but also is going to be a world-class father.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:22.840]   Be careful and discriminatory in that process.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:28.220]   In summary of what I've said so far,
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:31.580]   if you want your child to invest
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:34.460]   into the long-term success of your children,
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:40.760]   it begins with who the parents of your children are.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:44.580]   And since you're going to be one of those parents,
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:49.580]   the primary choice that you have is who is the other parent?
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:55.220]   Who's going to provide the genetic seed necessary
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.480]   for the growth of this baby?
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:02.720]   And who is going to be there throughout the long,
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:07.720]   challenging life course of this child and of this baby?
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:13.680]   Make sure if you want children that you're marrying somebody
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.980]   that you want to have children with.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.680]   Make sure also, of course, that you talk about it
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.420]   and that you want to have children.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:21.440]   That's a fundamental component, of course,
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.880]   of those important conversations.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:28.880]   But be very, very careful and discriminatory in advance
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:34.500]   of your mate.

[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:12.320]   - I think I'm going to conclude this podcast episode here.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.620]   I was planning to go through every step,
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:19.160]   but I've spoken a little bit in greater detail
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.760]   about these topics than I intended to,
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.000]   but I'm satisfied with what I've recorded.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   I believe it's appropriate.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.360]   So we'll pick it up in the next episode.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.600]   Also, of course, my children have awakened
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.480]   from their nap time and I'm now needed in my household
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.880]   in order to allow my wife to rest and to sleep.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.280]   I can hear them in the other room,
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:40.500]   and so I'm needed for daddy duties.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.760]   So we'll make this into a multi-part series
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.720]   instead of a two-part series,
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.800]   which was the original intention.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.280]   I hope that these ideas have been useful to you.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.320]   I hope that these things have been helpful.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:53.680]   I guess the final comment I would make,
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.240]   it's just simply that for many of us,
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.120]   these things, these decisions are already made.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.240]   For many of us, we already have a child, right?
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.000]   We've already chosen who we're married to.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.920]   We've already chosen these kinds of things.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.820]   The child is already generated and created, et cetera.
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:13.040]   But I do have a significant amount of my listening audience
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.480]   who has not made those choices.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.360]   And I believe that these things matter
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.920]   and they should be considered,
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.560]   they should be talked about, et cetera.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:25.880]   We should be talking, one of the important classes,
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.760]   it's funny, in our homeschool co-op,
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:32.440]   I believe that education should reflect reality.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.960]   And so in our homeschool co-op every year,
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.860]   we talk about, okay, what classes do we wanna have?
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:38.760]   And my wife suggested to the group, she's like,
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.080]   "You should have Joshua teach a class
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.160]   "on espousal selection class."
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:48.020]   And the teenagers, shockingly, didn't jump on the idea
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:50.880]   for whatever reason, but it's certainly a class
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.840]   that I'm going to be teaching systematically
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.440]   in my own homeschool and that I think
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.680]   we should teach to children.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.680]   The life course that people are on is so blindingly obvious
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:07.880]   that if we'll walk away from the Hollywood mumbo jumbo
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.960]   and all the garbage that they create
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:13.320]   about the way life works and we just look at it,
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.120]   it's so blindingly obvious, right?
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.120]   You don't want, character matters, physicality matters,
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.420]   health matters, et cetera.
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:23.400]   This stuff makes a huge difference.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.180]   And what I believe is so important
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:29.900]   is when you build a foundational relationship
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:34.260]   based upon compatibility, respect, et cetera,
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:38.060]   based upon a philosophy and a worldview of love, right?
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:42.060]   My definition of love is that love is an action.
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:43.660]   It's not a feeling, right?
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:46.080]   Love is an action, like Voddie Bachum's definition.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.400]   But love is an action, excuse me,
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.120]   love is, what does he say?
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:54.560]   Love is a decision, love is a, now I'm blanking on it.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.320]   Love, act of the will, that's what it is.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:01.920]   Love is an act of the will, accompanied by emotion
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.060]   that leads to action on behalf of its object.
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:07.800]   I'm surprised I forgot that.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.840]   I find that to be one of the most useful definitions of love.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.280]   Love is an act of the will, accompanied by emotion
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.200]   that leads to action on behalf of its object.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.100]   The idea is love is not something that you just feel, right?
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.840]   Those are chemical reactions and they come and go
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:26.780]   and they're important, but they're not fundamental.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:31.780]   They are the important and worthy and wonderful icing
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:35.640]   on top of the cake that makes the whole cake wonderful.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.400]   But if that cake is just icing, right?
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.440]   Icing is gross, children think icing is great.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.800]   Like, oh, I can just eat icing.
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.380]   Then you reach about 15 and you realize
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:47.580]   that eating icing is not nearly as wonderful
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:52.580]   as eating a really delicious cake with icing on top.
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:57.880]   What Hollywood calls love and what our culture worships
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:01.600]   of these emotional reaction and feeling to another person
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.840]   is the wonderful icing on top of the cake
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.880]   that makes it spectacular, right?
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.840]   Makes it just burst in your mouth with flavor
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:14.600]   and you love it, but it's not the foundation for a cake.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.760]   And so we need to, if we're gonna see
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.700]   our great-great-grandchildren succeed,
[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:21.760]   we need to establish a family culture
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.880]   in which these issues are discussed consistently
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:29.720]   and thoughtfully so that our children arrive
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.360]   at marriage age of 20, 25, 30 years old
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.720]   and they have a clear understanding
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.840]   of what they're looking for and what is available to them.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.120]   So enough for today.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.120]   Thank you so much for listening.
