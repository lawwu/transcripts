[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.740]   in the right direction.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.380]   This is another one of those episodes where the surpassing value meets brain community
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.380]   church.
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.860]   For this episode, I invited Pastor Peter Kim and Pastor Mark Lim to talk about this emerging
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.900]   trend called deconstructionism.
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.620]   If you don't know what it is, I explained it to some degree in the beginning of the
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.580]   recording, but to get us started, let me quote to you Brandon Briscoe, he's a pastor over
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.100]   at Midtown Baptist.
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.380]   He writes this concerning deconstructionism, "In its most innocuous form, deconstruction
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.140]   may be promoted as a healthy reassessment of personal bias and ingrained denominational
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.140]   positions, but upon closer examination tends to institute new bias that is inherently critical
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.080]   to the concept of biblical certainty.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.820]   The Christian deconstructionist approach is often exactly what Derrida intended it to
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.820]   be.
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.380]   The employment of philosophy, liberal forms of literary criticism, scientific theory,
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.860]   historical record, and other human disciplines intended to scrutinize the literality of long
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.140]   held biblical teachings in order to replace them with more abstract and progressive perspectives.
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.020]   Christian deconstruction as a culture and methodology has become more than a re-examination.
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.180]   It is a premeditated tearing down of biblical authority."
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.620]   For the rest of the episode, the pastors and I flesh out what this is, why it's dangerous,
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.100]   and try to expose the inherent deceptiveness of this phenomenon.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.660]   Towards the end of the recording, I quote Spurgeon on this issue because I just found
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.540]   him to be so helpful.
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.700]   I only quoted him once in the recording, but I found myself unable to resist the temptation
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.620]   from quoting him again, so I'll just do that right now.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.340]   Before I do that, I want to read to you 2 Peter 1.10, and then I'll quote to you a portion
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.780]   of Spurgeon's commentary on that verse.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.740]   2 Peter 1.10 reads, "Therefore, brothers and sisters, be all the more diligent to make
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.460]   certain about his calling and choice of you.
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.860]   For as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble."
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:07.200]   Spurgeon regarding that verse says this, "Come, then, here is the second point good advice.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.380]   Make your calling and election sure.
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.220]   Not towards God, for they are sure to him.
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.240]   Make them sure to yourself.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.660]   Be quite certain of them.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.960]   Be fully satisfied about them.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.420]   In many of our dissenting places of worship, very great encouragement is held out to doubting.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.380]   A person comes before the pastor and says, 'Oh, sir, I am so afraid I am not converted.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.220]   I tremble lest I should not be a child of God.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.620]   Oh, I fear I am not one of the Lord's elect.'
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.940]   The pastor will put out his hands to him and say, 'Dear brother, you are all right so
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.620]   as long as you can doubt.'
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.780]   Now I hold that is altogether wrong.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.140]   Scripture never says, 'He that doubts shall be saved, but he that believes.'
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.420]   It may be true that the man is in a good state.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.540]   It may be true that he needs a little comfort.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.420]   But his doubts are not good things, nor ought we to encourage him in his doubts.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.460]   Our business is to encourage him out of his doubts and by the grace of God to urge him
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.940]   to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure, not to doubt it, but to
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.220]   be sure of it.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.940]   Ah, I have heard some hypocritical doubters say, 'Oh, I have had such doubts whether
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.500]   I am the Lord's, and I have thought to myself, and so have I very great doubts about you.'
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.220]   I have heard some say they do tremble because they are afraid they are not the Lord's people,
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.260]   and the lazy fellows sit in their pews on Sunday and just listen to the sermon, but
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.980]   they never think of giving diligence.
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.580]   They never do good, perhaps are inconsistent in their lives, and then talk about doubting.
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.180]   It is quite right they should doubt.
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.500]   It is well they should, and if they did not doubt, we might begin to doubt for them.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.580]   Idle men have no right to assurance.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.900]   The Scripture says, 'Give diligence to make your calling and election sure.'
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.720]   Full assurance is an excellent attainment.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.220]   It is profitable for a man to be certain in this life and absolutely sure of his own calling
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.860]   and election.
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.140]   But how can he be sure?"
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.220]   Remember this because as we delve into this discussion, you'll soon see the relevance.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.100]   And I know I left off with a little bit of a cliffhanger, I'll answer Spurgeon's own
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:34.220]   question with Spurgeon at the end of the episode.
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:43.920]   All right, so as stated, I am joined with Pastor Peter Kim and Pastor Mark Lim.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.840]   I invited them here because I thought it would be helpful if we as a group collective fleshed
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:58.360]   out this phenomenon that's been going on for several years now called deconstructionism.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.320]   It's been in the news a little bit more lately.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.720]   If you don't know the term, I'm sure you're familiar with Joshua Harris.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.440]   Joshua Harris was a big-time celebrity pastor.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:17.280]   He was affiliated with a huge church network that started in the East Coast, and he came
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.600]   out a couple years back saying that he wasn't a Christian, that he deconstructed his faith.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.680]   And that if there was another way to be a Christian, that he might actually be a Christian,
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.760]   but he was still just working on that, so to speak.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.900]   I'm going to quote him in a little bit.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:42.100]   But more recently, there was another Christian celebrity, his name is Kevin Max.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.160]   If you're familiar with the group DC Talk, he was part of that group.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:53.440]   And he came out saying the same thing, that he is going through a stage in his life where
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.360]   he's deconstructing his faith.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:06.520]   If you have a lot of Christian friends, and they're maybe talking about this, thinking
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.760]   about this, wondering about the legitimacy of this, our hope is that you will find this
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.140]   discussion helpful, if not just for learning about the topic, maybe you can minister to
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.140]   other people.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:24.240]   Maybe you're listening to this, and you're thinking to yourself, "How do I think of this?
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.560]   How do I sort through this?
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.560]   Is it biblical?"
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.560]   Et cetera.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.660]   So that's what we want to cover in this podcast.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.040]   Just to set things up, I want to read to you a quote by Joshua Harris.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.920]   He's the famous former celebrity pastor that I talked about in the beginning.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:51.200]   But he said this, and I'm quoting him now, "Significant changes have taken place in both
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.200]   of us."
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.880]   Referring to him and his wife.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.800]   He wrote, "The popular phrase for this is deconstruction.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.900]   The biblical phrase is falling away.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:08.120]   By all the measurements that I have for defining a Christian, I am not a Christian.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.960]   Many people tell me that there is a different way to practice faith, and I want to remain
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.480]   open to this, but I'm not there now."
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.940]   Again, this is a former celebrity pastor.
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.880]   This was a couple years back.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:28.960]   He was huge in the purity culture movement when I was in college, but that was him.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.880]   There was a blog article concerning Kevin Max, I'm going to read to you portions of
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880]   it.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.080]   He's the other Christian celebrity pastor I just spoke about, but this is more recent.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.280]   This was like last month.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.120]   The blog article goes to say this, "Grammy-winning vocalist Kevin Max, a member of the popular
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.400]   Christian band DC Talk, who has released music in multiple genres, revealed over the weekend
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.400]   that he considers himself to be an ex-vangelical."
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:01.480]   "Hello, my name is Kevin Max, and I'm an ex-vangelical," he tweeted Saturday, sparking
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.580]   a large response from many of his Christian followers.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.420]   Some praised the musician's post, claiming they were also ex-vangelicals, a term that
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:15.060]   has been used commonly in recent years to describe individuals who no longer identify
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.180]   as evangelicals.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.780]   Others in social media stated that they had never heard the term, which has been associated
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.940]   with progressive Christians who have left evangelical Christianity due to theological
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.140]   or political reasons in recent years.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:34.060]   In response to a social media user who said Max no longer believed in Jesus, the Jesus
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.940]   Freak singer quipped, "Nope, didn't say that.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.900]   Read text carefully."
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:45.860]   In another post, Max clarified that he still follows the "universal Christ."
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.340]   This is Kevin Max again.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:53.540]   He says, "I have no idea how many people's blogs or podcasts are using that announcement
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.180]   for further division.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.420]   But I'm here for The Grace, and The Grace is capitalized," he assured.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.300]   The musician added further detail on his Twitter thread.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:08.500]   "For all those people using my post as plug-and-play for your own hot take or personal discourse,
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.660]   I offer the lyrics to an upcoming song of my new band, Astronauts' sad album, Adult
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.420]   Fears, titled, 'It's Okay.
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.500]   I'm sorry for being obtuse or difficult, but it's a process I love.'"
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.580]   And then he goes on to kind of quote his lyrics.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:28.460]   Later on in the same article, he goes on to say, "The overall movement is called deconstruction,
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.700]   meaning deconstructing one's faith and leaving the church.
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:39.100]   Many who are deconstructing have spoken out about their experiences getting hurt by people
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.700]   inside the church.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.780]   Others have cited their rejection of biblical teaching on sexuality as a reason they are
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.640]   disassociating.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.100]   Max has made a living as a vocalist in bands that promote Christian message, such as DC
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.600]   Talk, alongside bandmates Toby Mack and Michael Tate.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.220]   He also sang for Audio Adrenaline.
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.380]   Max has been speaking out for some time about his resistance to a particular version of
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.580]   Christianity.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:08.260]   In an interview in December with Decent Christian Talk podcast, Max explained where he is on
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.020]   his journey in deconstructing.
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.660]   "I like to call it deconstruction, reconstruction," he said.
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:18.660]   "Any person that's really changing every day, which we do, you're going to deconstruct or
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.620]   you're going to reconstruct.
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.900]   So it's a combination of both of those things," he said.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.100]   "I've been deconstructing for decades.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.820]   I've always been progressing, as you can say.
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.980]   And then sometimes I regress.
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.420]   But I think where I'm at right now is I've really gone on a journey to find out what
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:41.300]   I truly believe in by reading a lot, thinking a lot, keeping my eyes and ears open."
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.220]   The musician has always been vocal about his thoughts online.
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:49.500]   While his comments online have been met with resistance, Max said he's always been a believer.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.820]   "But I'm questioning a lot of things and I've got more questions than answers," he says.
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.700]   So it kind of goes on, the blog article kind of goes on, and then it concludes with this.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:04.700]   "I believe in a God of the universe and I believe that he can hear me.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.380]   And that in itself is just plain kind of crazy.
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:13.980]   But if I believe that, then I truly believe that he cares about my progression and asking
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.460]   questions and wanting to know what is real and what isn't real," he ended.
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:24.060]   "I don't think the God that I believe in is going to just all of a sudden ignore me because
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:29.660]   I don't believe every single thing that's written down somewhere."
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:34.140]   So that was a bit of a long setup, but if you're not familiar with deconstruction, I'm
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:41.060]   setting that up because I want you to be aware of what we're talking about, the backdrop
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.060]   of this.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:48.860]   I'll include the article that I've read from in the info section for the podcast, but I
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.340]   just kind of want to open it up.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.500]   Pastor Peter, Pastor Mark, what do we make of all this?
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.140]   How do we think through this and how do we sort this out?
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:07.980]   Well, let me share briefly about when I first became a Christian, I started off from the
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:15.540]   get-go questioning everything because the Christianity that I experienced growing up,
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:21.420]   I hated because I saw a lot of just cultural Christianity.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.820]   I've met a lot of Christian, in the Korean community, Christian celebrities, mega church
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:33.140]   pastors and not seeing the genuineness of what they were preaching, at least from behind
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.140]   the curtain.
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.860]   And it wasn't until after I became a Christian I realized that the biblical Christianity
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.820]   I saw in Scripture didn't look anything like what I saw growing up.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.060]   And so that, right off the bat, caused me to question everything.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.540]   What's biblical?
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.540]   What's right?
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.540]   What's wrong?
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:14:00.140]   And so, now, when I hear people saying that they're deconstructing or backsliding, however
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:08.300]   you want to call it, it seems like to me that they kind of committed to the cultural Christianity
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.660]   to begin with.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.260]   And maybe for the first time in their life, or maybe this was going on behind the scene
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:20.860]   and they were pretending in the front, and for the first time, taking a step back, realizing
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.940]   that their faith was not genuine.
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:32.260]   And so my concern with this movement is that the primary concern was themselves, like what
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.700]   they committed to, why they committed it to, if they had genuine faith or not had genuine
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:36.700]   faith.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:42.820]   But instead of turning that toward themselves and asking the question about what they genuinely
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:48.300]   believe, they turn it and then they're attacking the church and saying the reason why they
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.140]   are the way they are is because the church is the way it is.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:59.060]   And so, not that everything that's happening in the church is right or wrong, but I think
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:06.340]   the attention really should be self-focused, you know, instead of making this a proclamation
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.620]   like oh, we need a movement, you know, to break away.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.540]   And rather running toward Scripture, you're running away from Scripture.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.340]   And so that's where I see the danger.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:22.540]   So asking yourself, you know, like is my faith genuine or not, I think that's a good question
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.540]   for them to have.
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:30.020]   But then for that to turn into, because my faith was not genuine, everybody's faith isn't
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.060]   genuine.
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.780]   And I think that's where the danger lies.
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:40.940]   I think also for me, you know, we could talk about how to minister to somebody who is experiencing
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:48.700]   doubt, but even if somebody came to my office telling me that, the worst forms of deconstructions
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:53.340]   that are happening now and what you read from Joshua Harris, I would just give a fair warning
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:58.300]   like you have to be careful because you can end up deeply offending God.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:05.420]   When we talk about doubt just generally, are we not talking about doubt in either God's
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.900]   plan, God's church, or God himself?
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.340]   And if that's the case, then it could be very similar to the Exodus generation where he
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.340]   brings them out of Egypt, but they ask him where were you, why didn't you feed us, how
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.780]   come we don't have a leader, where is he?
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:25.460]   And these questions, yes, perhaps on a human level you can understand, but you have to
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.220]   be careful because then you're completely forgetting God.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:34.300]   And what's kind of eerie is even if you listen to the way that Kevin Max is talking, the
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.620]   beginning portion of a discussion where he's talking about his progression and his thoughts,
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.460]   that portion of it doesn't really involve God.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:48.380]   That's him thinking through his thoughts and then having a lack of consideration for the
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.260]   will of God, the thought of God, etc.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:56.420]   So the danger with the worst forms of deconstruction actually is something that could be very deeply
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.180]   offensive to God.
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:05.940]   Yeah, you know, just kind of researching this topic before this podcast episode, what's
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:11.660]   interesting is that the term deconstructionism, and this is for the listener here, the term
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.660]   deconstructionism actually was coined by a philosopher.
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:22.180]   And I remember this philosopher in college because I took a couple classes, but his name
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.060]   is Jacques Derrida.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:34.940]   And what deconstructionism is, from the actual secular philosophical term, is Jacques Derrida,
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:43.760]   he is seeking to loose the meaning between text and what is actually being espoused.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:51.760]   So if you go down that road, what you're essentially saying is that objective truth is unknowable.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:58.980]   And if objective truth is unknowable, well, we espouse the Bible to be objective truth.
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:04.220]   And so if you're saying the Bible is unknowable, that the text in the Bible is unknowable,
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:09.100]   then what you're saying is the Bible doesn't have authority because I don't know what the
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:13.160]   Bible says, you don't know what the Bible says, which is why I think Kevin Max can say
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.260]   things like, "Well, I still believe in God," or, "I still believe in the universal Christ."
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.940]   He can say these things.
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:23.620]   And before, we understood if you didn't believe in the authority of the Bible, then we knew
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.780]   that you weren't a Christian.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:30.060]   But the dangerous thing is you have people like Joshua Harris and Kevin Max who's saying,
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.100]   "Well, maybe there is a way I can still be Christian, but lose the authority of the Bible."
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.060]   And we're saying, "No, no, you can't."
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:41.880]   And I kind of want to bring this back, Pastor Peter, to what you talked about and you were
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:48.820]   kind of honing in on, is that we are in no way saying that you can't have questions or
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:55.420]   you shouldn't ask questions or that people who love God do not experience doubt in any
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.420]   way, shape, or form.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:01.260]   We are not saying that at all, and in fact, anyone that knows us knows we love questions
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:06.220]   because if you have questions and you ask, these are genuine questions, you come out
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.980]   more convicted about your faith because the Bible withstands scrutiny.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:15.380]   There is no scrutiny that the Bible is scared of.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:23.420]   There are no questions that the Bible needs to hide behind, like how was the Bible formed?
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.980]   Can we trust the Bible?
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:31.740]   Things like this, there are great, great answers for.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.620]   There's been plenty of material written about this.
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:40.120]   If there was anything, if there was any smoking gun that would reveal any falsity in the Bible,
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:46.060]   the way that the Bible's been attacked for the past thousands of years, and for the New
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.780]   Testament past 2,000 years, it would have been revealed.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:57.940]   But the New Testament, the Bible altogether, it outlives all its critics for a reason.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.220]   It outlives all its critics for a reason.
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.100]   So we're going to keep talking about this, but I want to say that if you're listening
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:10.460]   to this podcast and you do not leave with the impression that somehow we are in any
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:16.300]   way espousing that asking questions is ungodly, we're not saying that at all.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.340]   Asking genuine questions and searching is great because your conviction comes out more
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.900]   refined and more strong.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:29.060]   I had so many questions about the existence of God, all the usual questions about why
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.420]   does good God allow suffering, can we trust the Bible, what about evolution, what about
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.420]   dinosaurs, all these questions have long been answered.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:45.820]   So we want to make sure that there isn't a conflation, that you don't leave this podcast
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:51.660]   thinking, well, asking questions will somehow lead to ungodliness.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:57.140]   And I think that's part of the confusion is that it's playing on this idea of asking questions
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:02.980]   as being genuine, but then conflating it with some noble task of rejecting the Bible.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.340]   Yeah, I think that's a very good point.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:12.620]   And the reason why we're here isn't because young Christians or non-believers are asking
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.060]   good questions.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:20.500]   The reason why we're here is people who have had the title of leadership, who are answering
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.540]   these questions while saying they themselves doubt.
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.220]   So that's the problem.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:32.380]   People that young Christians are going to, who they looked up to and assumed that they
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:38.700]   were spiritual leaders, are saying things that you wouldn't expect spiritual leaders
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:39.700]   to say.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.060]   Because in one sense, they're representing God, saying God says this and the Bible says
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.740]   this and we believe this.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:50.300]   And then at the same breath saying, I actually never believed any of that and I'm testing
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.300]   all of that.
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.300]   So the problem is not that there's questioning.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:22:00.860]   The problem is that maybe the people who have been in leadership should not have been there
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.420]   to begin with.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:08.420]   We live in this celebrity culture where if they're gifted and talented, there's no filter
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.780]   in bringing people into ministry.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.420]   And all of a sudden they have a large following and so they feel the pressure to live up to
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.620]   this calling of leadership.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:22.660]   Not this calling of we want to represent God properly, but to live up to the expectation
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.460]   of the gathering of people that they've stood in front of.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:35.700]   And so for years they've had doubts, but they were never able to address these doubts because
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.220]   they had to live up to the expectations of these people.
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.860]   But they came to a breaking point where they couldn't live up to that anymore.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.860]   And whether it was a moral failing or whether they just felt like a hypocrite or they weren't
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.860]   growing, whatever it was, they came to a crisis of faith and now for the first time they're
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.480]   revealing where they've probably been all this time.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.660]   So the real problem is they probably shouldn't have been in leadership to begin with.
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:04.660]   They should have stayed where they were, asking those good questions and sort of kept on learning.
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.220]   And then come to a point where they may have realized, "Man, I don't believe this," and
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.460]   walk away from their faith.
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.380]   And if that's what happened, we wouldn't be here now.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.020]   It's because these celebrity pastors have taken on that role that behind the scene they
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.860]   probably shouldn't have been there to begin with.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.820]   So that says a lot about our Christian culture.
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:30.300]   Yeah, talking about that Christian culture, I do think we live in a generation of fear.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:34.140]   A lot of people make their decisions based on fear.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.780]   But what's really interesting is one of the great fears of this generation is they're
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.500]   going to commit to something they don't like.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:45.820]   And when you talk about the kind of revelation of what's indicative of this Christian culture,
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:51.220]   a lot of people who are commenting about deconstruction, they'll say a lot of it starts from they've
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:56.580]   entered the church and what they don't like is a doctrinal stance against LGBTQ.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.980]   Or they went into the church and what they didn't like is the conflict they had with
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.980]   somebody.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.340]   What they didn't like is the culture of the church.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.860]   Something like that, right?
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:11.360]   So at that point, you're not actually even asking, "Is what we're doing worthwhile principally?
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.940]   Or is this biblical according to the will of God?"
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.940]   The question being asked is, "Can I live with this?
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.320]   Can I be in the church and actually live like this?
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.140]   How am I supposed to survive in here like this?"
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:28.020]   And so deconstruction becomes a selecting, a choosing of what will I be willing to accept?
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:33.460]   And what's really interesting to me is a senior editor of Gospel Coalition, Brett McCracken,
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:39.500]   he said, "If you go down that route of trying to analyze what do I like, what I don't like,
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.500]   then you do end up in a world of mysticism."
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:47.060]   Earlier you're talking about actually detaching certain elements of meaning from truth and
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.780]   not having a stronghold or foundation of biblical authority.
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.880]   But that's potentially what will result is if you're making decisions based on your fears
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:00.700]   or your emotions of what you'll accept, you'll kind of get to his, you know, kind of a massive
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.700]   statement of, "You know what?
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.420]   I'm actually always going to be progressing.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.220]   I don't think I'll ever stop."
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:12.620]   Because you're then now contingent upon what you feel you can accept in the moment in time.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.820]   Yeah, you know, that's, yeah, that's good.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:23.980]   You know, I was going through, you know, some, I was reading different blogs, actually speaking
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.660]   to different people while I was trying to research about this issue.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.500]   And what's interesting was there's a blog article by this guy named Keith Giles.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:39.040]   And he talks about the six pillars of religious deconstruction.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.580]   And these are the pillars he lists.
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:47.140]   So he writes, "The first pillar of Christian deconstruction is the Bible," right?
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.660]   And then he says in this blog article, he says this, "This is odd, since one would assume
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.700]   that the foundation of the Christian faith would be Christ.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.600]   But that's not the case, unfortunately.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.420]   For most evangelical Christians, especially, the Bible is their authority, and they will
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.140]   gladly affirm this if you're uncertain about it.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:07.380]   Because Christians tend to base their faith in the Bible, they also feel the need to overstate
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.900]   its importance, making it the linchpin for everything they hold dear.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:17.780]   Therefore, once you start to doubt their claims that the Bible is inerrant and infallible,
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.620]   the rest of your faith is soon to crumble."
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.940]   And it's not very hard to prove that the Bible is indeed filled with errors, mistakes, contradictions
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.940]   between prophets.
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:31.100]   And he goes on to talk about how the Bible is incorrect and is not trustworthy.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.500]   But there's other pillars right there to begin with.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:44.820]   But you see how, in terms of deconstruction, where this is headed to is not just doubt,
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:51.120]   it's not just a re-examination of one's faith, but as we've been talking about, it leads
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:58.380]   you to believe that you can be a Christian and doubt what the Bible says.
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.580]   And that is somehow virtuous, right?
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:09.980]   Now obviously, this blog article is massively incorrect, it's just patently false, when
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.940]   it says the Bible is filled with errors.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:17.820]   Anyone that has actually studied the Bible should be able to see that.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:24.340]   And I remember as a young Christian thinking this exact same thought, "How can I trust
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.180]   the Bible?
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.660]   How can I trust the Bible if it's old?"
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:35.360]   And that's a completely different podcast, but I went through that journey thinking,
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:41.700]   "Oh my gosh, just magnifying God because I can indeed trust the Bible."
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:49.460]   And again, deconstructionism, from what I've been reading and from just the people I've
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:58.100]   been talking to, the issue is, people begin to believe that you can hold to this idea
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:03.180]   that the Bible is false and still be a Christian.
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:07.660]   Before, those two concepts were dissimilar.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:13.500]   If you didn't believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, in the infallibility of the Bible,
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.140]   then you knew you weren't a Christian.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.980]   That is actually a better place.
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:23.460]   That is actually a much better place because you know who you are as opposed to, "Well,
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.460]   you know what?
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:30.780]   I can believe the Bible is false and still be a Christian, and everything is okay."
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:40.620]   So the problem with that logic is, for not hundreds, thousands of years, Christianity
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:47.300]   was based on belief of the Word of God in the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.100]   Once you reject that, it becomes relativism.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.700]   So you define whatever you want to define as Christianity.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:29:00.220]   So if a Hindu says, "I'm a Christian because I believe Jesus, and this is the Jesus that
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.220]   I believe."
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:06.380]   So the Jehovah's Witnesses are also Christian, then you have the Mormons, they're also Christian.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.940]   Who's to say they're not?
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:14.100]   If the basis in which Christianity is based on, you reject that as being unreliable.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:19.100]   So you're basically saying that you're going to define from this point on what Christianity
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:25.380]   is to you, and you have no right to question anybody else, LGBTQ, whatever they want it
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.140]   to be.
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:33.700]   The problem is, once you've rejected the Bible, you've rejected Christianity.
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.220]   You've rejected Christianity.
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:43.900]   So if that was your stance, my question is, what was your motive in coming into ministry?
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:50.100]   If you question the reliability of Scripture, what were you trying to do to influence other
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.660]   people?
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.700]   What were you thinking when you were preparing sermons?
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.400]   What were you doing when you were evangelizing?
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.260]   So basically you're saying that you've lived a double life, and no one forced you, twisted
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.100]   your arm to go into ministry.
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.060]   And all of a sudden you wake up and say, "Okay, now I've changed my mind.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.180]   Now I want to be a leader leading the other way."
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.740]   What is your motive?
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:18.600]   So is it truth that's driving you, or is it whatever agenda that you've had?
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:23.300]   But the basis on which you've founded your whole life on, you're throwing it away, and
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.520]   then now you're saying, "I'm going to go the other way, now follow me the other way also."
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.360]   So that's the inconsistency and hypocrisy that I see in all of this.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:36.780]   And so if you say, "I don't trust the Bible," you're being honest.
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.100]   That's what you believe.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.060]   And you should just say, "I'm going to go the other path."
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:49.500]   But to say that everything about Christianity is wrong because now you don't have confidence,
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.400]   to me that's disingenuous.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.740]   It makes me question what motivated you to be into ministry to begin with if you didn't
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:59.980]   have that confidence all along.
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:05.140]   And I do think, and maybe we could talk about this later, that obviously there are different
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:11.900]   degrees of doubt, and we're in some ways obviously addressing the worst form of the deconstruction
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:18.500]   where there is this high-level skepticism to what the scripture says, and a base belief
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.140]   that to just wholeheartedly commit to the scriptures and say it's all true and inerrant
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.620]   is foolish.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:31.580]   But within that, I do think there is a ton of the motivation behind it is not new, it's
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.300]   age-old which is self-justification.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:42.860]   People falsely assumed that God would accept my "righteous" behavior as Meredith so that
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.860]   he would accept me because that's how we operate.
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:50.420]   And so they assume, "Oh, of course God would accept me because I'm majority good."
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.420]   False.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:57.040]   But even if you read the way that Kevin Max talks, it's like, "Oh, God would take my doubts.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:02.640]   He would hear me out," and what you do is you constantly project who you would be unto
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.560]   God even though he's already told you what he's like.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.640]   He demands perfection.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.420]   He demands faith.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:13.200]   And what you have in this desire is to self-justify.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.780]   And people have done it different ways.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:20.340]   But now in the worst form of deconstruction, you just completely flip it upside down.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:25.120]   My doubt rather than it being a cause of concern or something needed to be addressed, it becomes
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.120]   good.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.080]   Jesus will say to us, "Why do you not believe what I said?
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.080]   You have a little faith.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.760]   Why did you doubt?"
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.560]   But instead we say, "No, no.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.560]   Trust me.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.560]   This is good.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.240]   This is a necessary part of what I need to do."
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:44.720]   And you flip the definitions and typically those definitions then now become determined
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.840]   by what I would do.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:52.600]   And I think that's why earlier I was saying highly potential you can offend God because
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.180]   you start projecting unto him how you would do it.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.680]   You start projecting unto him how he should be.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.120]   And I think it again is a really dangerous path.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:10.960]   Yeah, you know, I want to just read 2 Peter chapter 1 verse 10 here because it's pertinent
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.960]   to our discussion.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:19.240]   But Peter says this, Apostle Peter says, "Therefore, brothers and sisters, be all the more diligent
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.760]   to make certain about his calling and choice of you.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.640]   For as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble."
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.000]   Verse 11 says, "For in this way, the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.880]   Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you."
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:41.520]   So the admonition in Scripture, the admonition in Scripture is to make all the more diligent
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.680]   and certain about his calling and choice of us.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:58.080]   The virtue in somehow rejecting doctrines that sincere Bible-believing Christians have
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:05.560]   had for centuries, that somehow that's virtuous, that somehow that's what God desires, that's
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.080]   completely false.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.080]   As you can see even just from the one passage I read.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:17.160]   And when you think about how the Word of God, because this is an attack on the Word of God.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.360]   It's very simple here.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:24.240]   People like to think that there's this idea of neutrality, am I in charge or is God in
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.520]   charge?
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.520]   Let's start from the middle.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.040]   Let me tell it to you right now.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.160]   Neutrality is a myth.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.680]   Neutrality is an absolute myth.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.720]   There's no such thing as neutrality.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:39.560]   This is the law of non-contradiction, the law of the excluded middle.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.280]   I mean, go ahead and look that up.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.480]   There really is no neutrality in the way we envision it.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:49.200]   Either God is God or we are God.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.200]   It's one or the other.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:54.000]   And God has spoken to us through his Word.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   That's the way he has revealed himself to us in a very specific way.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.840]   We can know about God through what we see, however, if we want to know about salvation,
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.600]   we go to the Scriptures.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:14.080]   So once you lose the authority of the Scriptures, you lose the authority of God subjectively
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.160]   in your life.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.520]   And at that point, you erect an idol.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.520]   And that idol is yourself.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.040]   And you're saying, "Well, this is the right way to interpret reality.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.720]   This is the right way to interpret morality.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.080]   This is the right way to even interpret God."
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:33.360]   But Peter here, in 2 Peter 1, verse 10, he's saying, "Therefore, brothers and sisters,
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:38.000]   be all the more diligent to make certain about his calling and choice of you."
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.200]   So I think part of that is asking questions.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.720]   You have a genuine question about how the Bible was formed, because I did, and I got
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.720]   them all answered.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.480]   You have a genuine question about church history and how Christians have survived through all
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.720]   these years and why we can hold to these certain doctrines?
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.720]   Good, because I had those same questions and I looked into it.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.320]   Do you have a question about evolution?
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.320]   Good.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.440]   I had that same question and I looked into it.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:07.160]   Every single question about whether it's good and evil, whether it's empirical data, whatever
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.160]   it is, my questions have all been answered.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:16.600]   And us three of us, we're skeptics, but naturally we're skeptics.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:23.440]   But we're also convicted about the authority of Scripture, which is why we're here.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:28.480]   But this conviction is absolutely born through genuine questions.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:34.640]   My point is there is a distinction that needs to be made between genuine questions that
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:41.720]   need to be asked and what deconstructionism is positing and what deconstructionism is
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.720]   proposing.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:49.120]   So if you're talking to your friends and they're going through this phase, there is this kind
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:57.680]   of push to not merely ask questions, but to go beyond that and to actually believe that
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:03.280]   you can be a Christian and disregard the claims of Scripture.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:12.000]   Yeah, let me say this because I'm approaching this, or at least from what I'm seeing, there's
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.880]   been issues with Christianity, again, way before even before I became a Christian.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:26.160]   And yeah, I mean, I'm not a fan of modern day Christianity myself.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.960]   I think the church is sick.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:33.520]   I think the way that people come into ministry, what's being taught and been being practiced
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:39.880]   and almost sometimes like circus kind of atmosphere that churches have in order to draw people
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.880]   to the church.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.720]   All of this stuff is stuff that I have a problem with.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:49.800]   So the fact that we are deconstructing or examining or questioning in and of itself
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:58.920]   is not a bad thing, but the fact that it's coming from leaders who are not only questioning
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:05.460]   certain fundamental things that really should have been asked to begin with, one, do I really
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.080]   believe this God?
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.920]   Two, do I believe that the Bible is inerrant?
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.000]   Like this is God's word given to me.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:22.720]   And if you had doubt in these two fundamental questions, you shouldn't have been in ministry.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.600]   Why would somebody who doubts the law go into the legal field?
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.520]   Why would somebody who doubts medicine go into the medical field?
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.520]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:37.160]   Like I don't trust Western medicine, but I'm going to give 13 years of my life studying
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:42.520]   this and then at the end of it and saying, I don't know if I would practice this.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:48.200]   So right off the bat, they probably shouldn't have gone into ministry, right?
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.240]   But here's the other part.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.640]   Christianity is not something that you just learn objectively.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.880]   There is a subjective aspect where God opens your eyes and you see the glory of Christ.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:03.780]   But the Bible makes it very clear where God says, you will seek me and find me when you
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.000]   seek me with all your heart.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.020]   No one casually sees God.
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:14.160]   No one kind of like tests the waters and then God shows up and begging you to come to the
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.540]   other side.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.560]   God says to make up your mind.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.360]   If you are going to worship God, worship him.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.680]   If you're going to worship the world, worship the world.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:26.720]   But according to scripture, whether you believe it or not, we've offended God.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.920]   And so the first question that a non-believer asks is, do I believe that?
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.720]   Do I believe what he says about my state?
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:40.080]   And so once you make that decision, you repent of your sins and then you search him with
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.760]   all your heart.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.780]   And that's what causes you to see an increasing evidence of God's glory, which increases your
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.540]   faith.
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:54.340]   But the problem that we have now is we have a generation or a cultural Christianity where
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.660]   even in the leadership, they're not diligently seeking God.
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.340]   They're dabbling with the world, concerned about everything else that everybody else
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:09.180]   is concerned about, and they're objectively thinking that they're going to read a book
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.580]   or they're going to find something and something's going to cause them to open their eyes.
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:18.500]   So almost kind of like demanding God to prove himself, even as they are claiming that they
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.180]   know God.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:25.500]   And so after a while, they don't encounter God, not because God is not revealing himself,
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:31.220]   but because they maybe have never committed themselves to fully seek after God.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:35.540]   And then instead of questioning where they are, they start questioning God because God
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:40.740]   didn't jump when he asked them to jump, when they thought like, "Oh, come," and he didn't
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.740]   come.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.740]   So maybe it's not real.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:48.900]   Not realizing maybe where they are is not where God wants them to be to begin with.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:53.540]   And the problem is if this was happening with people at church, we would counsel them to
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:56.900]   encourage them to continue to seek, continue to ask.
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:00.260]   But we're not talking about people in the church who are asking.
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:03.380]   They're not, and they're not asking questions right now.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.700]   They're making a statement.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.980]   They're not saying like, "I doubt, you know, like I really need to know.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.900]   I really, like somebody answer my question."
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.420]   They're not asking that.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:17.540]   They're saying, "I have all the answers and here's my latest answer," which contradicts
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.620]   everything I said before, right?
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:27.820]   So I think at the minimum, they need to be self-aware and take a step back and say, "Maybe
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:31.460]   I shouldn't have been a leader to begin with," you know what I mean?
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.700]   Instead of blaming all of Christianity and the Bible and everything else, that maybe
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.620]   their faith was never in the place where they should have been leading.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:44.540]   And that's really what's causing this problem because it's confusing a lot of young Christians.
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.380]   We thought they were mature, and that's what mature Christians look like.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.340]   No, that is not what mature Christians look like, and that's where the confusion is coming
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.340]   from.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:42:01.100]   I'm really glad you mentioned that about definition of what is actually mature faith, you know.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.340]   In this generation, I think there is a lot of confusion because some people maybe wrongly
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:10.580]   assume that you literally have to wait 10 years after receiving some kind of doctorate
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:15.140]   degree or something like that in a highly intellectualized faith.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:19.740]   But I definitely want to just, you know, for anybody listening who's just feeling like,
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:22.660]   "Oh yeah, there are a lot of voices in this generation.
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.900]   Our Lord commended childlike faith."
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:31.820]   Even in the discussion of critical thinking, am I the fool to say, "My God is my Father.
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:35.780]   He loves me, so everything He says, I trust Him."
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.100]   Am I the fool for saying that?
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:41.300]   No, that's commended as mature faith.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:49.180]   And so to think that perhaps in a maybe well-intended but sloppily applied thought that to be real
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:56.900]   is to be more mature, to be like constantly expounding every doubt you have or to expose
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.540]   since everybody experiences this, since this is the communal experience, like this is to
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:06.300]   be more glorified, that goes against how Jesus is defining more mature faith.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:12.220]   So I didn't, I don't like it when, yes, leaders of this day are trying to project that actually
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:18.060]   doubting your, the resurrection of Jesus or doubting the existence of God or doubting
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:22.900]   the church, which is Christ's bride, is somehow more mature, right?
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:32.100]   The definition always has been, no, your ability to take God's Word and fully trust and then
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:38.380]   take His character into account and therefore fully invest yourself into what He has said
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:43.620]   and prove it to be true by the commitments of your life, that's maturity.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:47.340]   But they're flipping it on its head and that's again very dangerous.
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:53.780]   Yeah, you know, if I can just read some passages here, look at what Scripture says about Scripture.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:59.660]   Psalm 119, 105, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:05.260]   And we, 2 Peter 119, "And we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:10.940]   will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place."
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:15.380]   Deconstructionism doesn't view the Word of God as a lamp.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:20.540]   It doesn't view the Word of God as something you should pay attention to as a lamp shining
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.180]   in a dark place.
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:27.060]   Second Timothy 3, 16, 17, "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching,
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:31.460]   for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:35.300]   be competent, equipped for every good work."
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:39.420]   Second Timothy 3, 15, right before that it says, "The sacred writings, which are able
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.900]   to make you wise for salvation."
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:46.100]   Deuteronomy 6, 4, "Hear, O Israel."
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.060]   "Hear, O Israel," that, that, "Hear, O Israel," what?
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.140]   "The Word of God."
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:56.620]   So we see that, you know, an attack on the Word of God is an attack on God himself.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:01.540]   When you attack the Word of God, you are going to make someone else God, either yourself
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.900]   or some other idol you see in the culture.
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:08.220]   Now, if you're honest about that, that's one thing.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:17.820]   But if you see cognitively, okay, how that makes sense, my concern is people who tear
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.100]   down the authority of the Word of God cognitively don't even see that.
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:27.020]   And kind of just what Pastor Peter, Pastor Mark have been talking about, it kind of starts
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.940]   with the leaders, right?
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:33.900]   I mean, the Word of God says all this, but quite frankly, younger Christians don't know
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.660]   what the Word of God says.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:42.560]   So when people who are in positions of leadership say, "Oh, this is actually what the Word of
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.560]   God says."
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:51.060]   Now, you might not verbally, explicitly articulate it in that way, but when you express any,
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:57.460]   when you cast a light that the scriptures are not worthy to be trusted, you get into
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.620]   all kinds of trouble.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:03.860]   And what's interesting here is that in that same blog post article, "The Six Pillars of
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:09.380]   Religious Deconstruction" by Keith Giles, the second, the first pillar is getting rid
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:10.380]   of the authority of the Bible.
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:13.020]   And then after that, everything else just crumbles, right?
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.880]   You stop believing in hell.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:20.740]   You stop believing in penal substitution or atonement.
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:25.520]   You cannot reconcile suffering in the world with a good and holy God.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:30.620]   You stop believing, you have a weird form of eschatology.
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:39.940]   And ultimately here, the sixth pillar that he writes is you ultimately leave the church.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:44.180]   You ultimately just leave the church because, you know, the church at that point, you know,
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:48.700]   any sound Bible teaching church, if you don't agree with that, you're going to kind of view
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.220]   that as "abuse."
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:57.580]   They keep saying that the Bible is authoritative and it's abusing me, right?
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:03.700]   It's abusing me so it's unhealthy to be here because they're ramming this unhealthy thought
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:08.780]   that I can trust everything in the Bible and then you ultimately leave.
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:15.820]   And I think now kind of moving into the idea, you talked about failure and leadership.
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:22.860]   There is a sense when leadership has to prepare the congregation to be strong for the hardships
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.180]   ahead, the suffering ahead that they'll experience.
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:30.420]   And again, I can point to the theme, there's a, you know, a lot of people who talk about
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:36.440]   people who fall into deconstruction because of experience where maybe they had real scenarios
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:42.080]   where they were hurt or pained very deeply, but there's a sense in which the church or
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:47.540]   again leadership didn't prepare them to think about that kind of suffering in their lives
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.020]   in a godly fashion, right?
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:54.380]   Perhaps to expect nothing more than blessings from God when scripture very clearly asks
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:59.560]   this question, "Shall I accept only blessing and not calamity from the Lord?"
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:03.220]   Or even to think through the New Testament where it talks about looking at the various
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:08.500]   trials that we will face and receiving it with hope, joy, strength in Christ because
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:12.060]   we're living that life of faith, right?
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:17.260]   So it's sad to me that individuals who do experience genuine suffering are kind of relegated
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:21.200]   to wonder, like throw their hands up and wonder, "How can I be strong like this?"
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:26.100]   And it is sad, even more sad if those individuals are looking to leaders for strength and their
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:30.420]   leadership rather than trying to strengthen their faith and bolster their faith, they're
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:31.420]   just agreeing with them.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.060]   You're right, I don't know either, right?
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:35.720]   That to me is a sad state of affairs.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:40.100]   So scripture commands all brethren, whether you're a leader or not, it says, "Take care
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:45.180]   brethren that there not be in any of you an evil unbelieving heart that falls away from
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:49.500]   the living God, but encourage one another day by day as long as it is called today so
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.580]   that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin," right?
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:49:00.300]   And I think we have to really ask the question again, how am I actually ministering and causing
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:06.980]   an individual who is perhaps experiencing a level of doubt and causing them to be strengthened
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:13.660]   as opposed to just simply validating all the woes and maybe even angst and complaints that
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:14.660]   they may have.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:19.540]   Again, I think there's a large conflation between, "Oh, there's critical thinking and
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.540]   genuine questions."
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:25.260]   Actually, if I read the articles from the leaders that are coming out online, they're
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:28.940]   just complaining about the church, they're complaining about their lives and complaining
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:33.260]   about the cars that God dealt them, and they're throwing their hands up like, "Which ones
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.860]   are we willing to accept or not?"
[00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:36.980]   And we can't conflate the two.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:44.780]   Yeah, I mean, in some sense, again, I can't read their mind and their heart, but it's
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:52.300]   hard to see the genuineness in some of the things that they're saying because it's
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:58.260]   kind of like, again, people may not like this, but like what Russell Moore did, he was the
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:02.740]   head of the ethics committee in the Southern Baptist and then he resigns and then he goes
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:07.540]   to - basically, he takes his hand off and then now he's ripping on everybody that he
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.760]   basically led.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:16.420]   To me, it's so disingenuous because you are in a position where that would have - if they
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:20.580]   did a - if all of these things that you're saying, how these people were swept, you know,
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:25.380]   sexual misconduct under the rug, you would have been the most guilty because you were
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:31.020]   the leader there, you know, and then you come out and then you say, "Look what they're
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.940]   doing."
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:37.140]   And I see the same thing with like, you guys were leaders.
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:42.320]   And so you influenced some of the culture that you are ripping on.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:47.540]   And for you to come out and say, "Look at those people," instead of saying, "I
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:48.960]   was wrong," right?
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:52.020]   Even though we may disagree with you, at least you can say, "I was wrong.
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:55.900]   I had doubts and I didn't deal with it for all these years.
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:59.780]   And so now I'm going to deal with the doubts that I should have dealt with years ago."
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:04.340]   Instead of saying that and being humble about it, you come out and saying, "Now that I'm
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:09.760]   out, I want to tell you all the things that are wrong with them."
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:16.140]   It's really hard to see that as a genuine wrestling with their faith, you know, because
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.580]   of the way that they're coming out and saying that.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:22.140]   It's kind of like you had one platform that didn't work out, now you're seeking another
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:23.140]   platform.
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:26.460]   And again, I can't read their heart, but it's from a distance.
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:31.540]   It's hard not to see it that way unless I see otherwise.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:36.980]   Because how can you be in charge of the ethics community and then resign and then rip on
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:39.980]   the ethics community that you are in charge of?
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:42.980]   Yeah, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:51.780]   Yeah, and so as I think about that, man, I think about like, there may be people who
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:57.380]   actually are struggling with doubt, you know, and then scripture says, "Be merciful to those
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:58.380]   who doubt."
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:02.820]   First Thessalonians talks about, "There are the unruly who need to be exhorted, but then
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.540]   there are the fainthearted who need to be encouraged," right?
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:11.900]   But my encouragement then would be, if you're doubting, then don't be a defensive doubter,
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:12.900]   right?
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:17.940]   So if I give this example, there are a lot of people who, in this busy generation where
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:22.780]   people are working late, have lots of responsibility, they're fainthearted and they're growing weary.
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:26.180]   But then they read scripture and scripture commands them, "Do not grow faint and weary
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.080]   hearted," right?
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.380]   So you have two options.
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:35.060]   One is to say, "Man, I'm fainthearted and weary and you're just going to tell me don't
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:36.060]   do it?"
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.060]   Right?
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.060]   And you get defensive.
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.960]   Like, "You don't understand how much I have on my plate.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.780]   You don't understand the experiences that I had.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.140]   You don't understand the pressures that I go through."
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:49.500]   Or you can be humble and receive the exhortation and say, "You know what?
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.100]   I am weary right now.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.380]   I'm fatigued," right?
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:58.780]   You could have a humble reception where there's a greater brokenness, that if I have doubt,
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.940]   then now it's a raise of concern.
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.100]   "Why do I have this doubt?
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:08.160]   What did I expect that perhaps need to be corrected in terms of my expectation, right?
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.620]   What false belief that I actually have, not they have, but what false belief that I have
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.540]   that I need to correct now?
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.860]   Why am I actually feeling so discouraged?"
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:17.860]   That should be the question.
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.540]   And that Pastor Peter, that's what you're getting at.
[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:24.880]   It's like, if you're really introspective on yourself, then now you're actually surrendering
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.120]   and submitting more to the exhortation of the scripture as opposed to being defensive
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.120]   about it.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.300]   It's like, "Don't tell me I'm wrong.
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:32.740]   I'm right."
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:38.280]   You can't come to the table like that and then expect God to somehow listen to that
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.280]   kind of heart.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.120]   You can't be a defensive doubter.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:53.960]   And you know, as I think about the convergence of celebrity Christian culture and within
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:54:01.740]   that kind of reality, the existence of, you know, faint-hearted Christians who need encouragement.
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:06.000]   And when I see the faint-hearted Christians who need encouragement get caught up and get
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.560]   misled, it's hard.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:10.560]   It's sad.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:17.140]   It's hard to deal with that because, you know, as shepherds, you have to love someone enough
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:22.960]   that you are willing to endure saying the truth, even if it means they dislike you or
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.160]   hate you.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:27.160]   Because you love them enough to tell them the truth.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.780]   You have to endure that.
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:36.520]   But if you're not willing to endure that, and you'd rather say some type of nicety,
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.420]   you really hate their soul.
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:42.000]   You must really hate them.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.860]   It's the strangest thing to me.
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:49.100]   And you know, Pastor Peter, you bring up Russell Moore, I mean, you know, anyone that, me personally,
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:55.860]   anyone that knows, I've had huge issues with, I can name a lot of people, but one person
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:00.220]   in particular, me personally, is Tim Keller.
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:08.020]   And I'm sure he personally loves the Lord, but I've been very disappointed with many
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:11.780]   of the things that he's been saying.
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:18.100]   Over the years, I've been disappointed with T4G and Gospel Coalition.
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:19.100]   I've been disappointed.
[00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:22.900]   Now, I'm not saying that it's all bad or anything like that, but I've been disappointed.
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:31.500]   And the reason, again, the reason we're disappointed is because we hate to see the young Christians,
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:37.540]   the faint-hearted Christians, get caught up in this and, you know, ultimately walk away
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.540]   from their faith.
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:42.100]   Now, of course, we understand that God is sovereign and that the ones who will persevere
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:46.340]   will persevere, but we work in the convergence of that.
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:50.660]   I don't believe in the sovereignty of God and not evangelize because, well, whoever's
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:52.900]   going to be saved is going to be saved.
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:58.820]   I believe in the sovereignty of God, and that makes me work harder because I'm more confident
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:01.260]   of who's in control, you know?
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:06.460]   And so, man, I'm going to hold myself back.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:10.820]   I can just burst like a dam when I think about that aspect of it.
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:17.140]   - Yeah, I mean, even within our church, we have different level of maturity, different
[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:21.340]   level of faith, and different level of commitment to the church.
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:24.460]   We have people who are coming to church who are not members of the church.
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:29.060]   They may be Christians, but they haven't committed, and we don't know if they're Christians because
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:30.060]   we don't know them, right?
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:33.700]   And so, they may have doubts, they may be questioning inerrancy, and then they may hear
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.380]   certain things and say, "Oh, I don't belong in this church because I don't believe what
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:39.180]   they believe," right?
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:40.540]   That's expected.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.160]   That's expected in that crowd.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.160]   That's why we have membership.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:47.200]   So, when you become a member, we make sure that, do you genuinely believe?
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.200]   Have you genuinely confessed?
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.680]   Because we wouldn't baptize you, right?
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.200]   And you wouldn't want to be baptized.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.600]   So, we want to make sure that the membership in the church are from genuine Christians.
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:00.680]   And to be a genuine Christian, you have to believe the Word of God is the Word of God.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:04.760]   If you don't believe that, then your faith is not based on anything other than, "I was
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:07.800]   taught this, and I choose to believe this, I choose not to believe this."
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.080]   So, what you believe, there's no boundaries.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.960]   You're just regurgitating something that you heard.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:16.800]   So, one of the first things as a member in the church, and even as members, you may have
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:18.280]   different degrees of faith.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:24.640]   So, we would expect, like you're searching, you've made a decision that, "I believe it's
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.800]   the Word of God," and you're genuinely saying, "I believe.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:29.800]   Help my unbelief.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   I want to grow in my faith."
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.560]   We expect that from that group.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.680]   And then within the church, you have people who are mature, right?
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.480]   Who can defend the faith.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:44.040]   They're still growing, they still have questions, but they're more mature than an average believer
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:47.480]   in the church, and that's why they're leading certain things.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:53.920]   In the eldership of the church, in the pastoral, like when we go through ordination, we assume
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.280]   all of that.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.120]   Because we've gone through the gauntlet through all of that.
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.560]   All of that is assumed.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:05.800]   We don't come into the leadership meeting asking, "Are we committed to this church?
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:07.520]   Do I actually believe what you're telling me?
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.400]   Like how can I trust you?"
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:12.400]   You know, "Is the Bible really real?"
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:19.640]   We don't expect that because we're committed to expound this, to teach this.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:25.520]   We're committed to plant churches, make sacrifices, and then teach other people, answer other
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.620]   people's questions.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:33.280]   But the fact that you have people who are in leadership, that they're not church hoppers,
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.580]   they're not just members of the church, they're not small group leaders, and they're not even
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.020]   just regular elders.
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:44.120]   These guys are people who put themselves in a position where they're writing books, going
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:53.000]   on tours, and then telling people in the thousands that you ought to believe all of this.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.480]   And then to say, "I've changed my mind.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:59:00.840]   In fact, not only did I change my mind, the right thing to do for everybody else is to
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:04.200]   do exactly what I'm doing."
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.620]   That's the problem.
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:12.860]   If they were church visitors, if they were even just brand new Christians, we could be
[00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:13.860]   patient.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:17.060]   You know, we try to answer questions like, "Oh, what is your doubt?
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:18.060]   Where is that coming from?
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:20.460]   Why do you doubt the Word of God?"
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:26.760]   But you sold yourself as a leader, you know, that you probably shouldn't have been there.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:34.540]   And so really, to be honest, there is no credibility in what you're saying because you contradicted
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:38.740]   everything that you propagated yourself with your mouth.
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:41.440]   And then you say, "I doubted all of that."
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:44.780]   So how do we know what you're saying is true now?
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:46.600]   How do we know that?
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:53.420]   So the content of what you say really is irrelevant, you know what I mean?
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:59.460]   Even if it has merit, it's irrelevant because you've contradicted yourself.
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:07.580]   I think the natural thing that a thinking person would do is to step out of the spotlight
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.780]   and to deal with your doubt.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:17.160]   And if you find yourself to reject the Word of God, then move away from your faith.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.740]   Become what you think you are, you know?
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:24.960]   But stop trying to lead, you know what I mean?
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:29.660]   By definition of what you're saying, you can't lead because you rejected what Christianity
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.820]   stands for.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:34.060]   So to me, this is very personal.
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:38.900]   This is not just objectively, you know, something's going on subject that I committed in my life.
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:44.540]   This is the God that I serve, that I love, that I'm willing to give my life for.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:50.940]   And for other people who are standing on a pulpit like I'm standing on and to reject
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:57.640]   the God that I love and to say that now that the guy that I know, he's the real God.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:04.680]   You are deceiving yourself and you are deceiving others and you are the wolf that the Bible
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.880]   talks about that is trying to lead people astray from God.
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.960]   And that is personally, again, it's very offensive.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.680]   And that's why we're doing this podcast because there is no gray area here.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.200]   This is not, this is not an in-house debate.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.200]   Absolutely.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:32.760]   And as you think, as we think through that, I mean, it's eerie how far and wide that chasm
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:39.800]   is between those who would affirm this process of deconstruction versus for us, we're saying
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.880]   God's grace to us has been to give us this truth, the revelation of the gospel.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.440]   And we hold on to that dear life, like that's everything, you know.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.080]   And then now as we're sitting here together thinking through this, you're right, it is
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:59.340]   personal in the sense because, again, like you said, James and Pastor Peter, like we're
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:04.080]   shepherding people and we're trying to counsel people who do sometimes struggle with the
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.280]   assurance of their salvation.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:13.840]   What has God given us to battle those moments and to rise out of those situations?
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:18.920]   He's given us in this generation, his precious truth that will stand the test of time and
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.440]   last forever.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.440]   He's given us the spirit of God to illuminate that word to us.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:30.080]   And so the only source that we have, the main, like the power of God and Jesus, you know,
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.040]   in his day, he would rebuke the people and say, "You didn't read the scripture, neither
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.080]   do you know the power of God."
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.520]   If you go down this path of deconstruction, you're going to miss it just like the previous
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.520]   generations.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:53.820]   You know, in a culture where it is anathema to say anything negative, I want to read Ephesians
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:03:01.040]   5.11 here says this, "And do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040]   even expose them."
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.400]   Let me read that again.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:10.560]   Ephesians 5.11 says, "And do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.280]   even expose them."
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:19.680]   So when you hear the pastors here talking about why this is personal to them, you have
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:28.880]   to understand that these are pastors who week in and week out are meeting with people, praying
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:36.120]   with people, praying that they will grow in their faith and not fall away from the faith,
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.280]   but grow in their faith.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:46.320]   So then when you see out in the culture, not just some fringe group here, but a phenomenon
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:53.920]   of where it is virtuous to lose your faith, to scale back on it, and at the ultimate end
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:59.760]   of it to disbelieve in the authority, to not believe in the authority of God, and to somehow
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:05.880]   even maintain that you are a Christian, that's incredibly deceptive.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:11.680]   And again, it's one thing to be on your way to hell and to know it.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:16.400]   That is infinitely better, because at least you know you're on the way to hell.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400]   There's hope for you.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.600]   But if you're on the road to hell and you believe you're on the way to heaven, that
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:26.040]   is exponentially worse, because you don't even know which way you're going.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:31.640]   So for the listener here, when you hear the pastors say that this is personal to them,
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:37.480]   I really want you to kind of put yourself in their situation.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.760]   How they're meeting with people of various ages, but people who are struggling to know
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:47.480]   God, and then all of a sudden you hear out in this Christian culture that you can be
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:54.480]   a Christian and not have the authority of God in your life.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:59.000]   The authority of the Bible is the authority of God, to not have that in your life.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:05.720]   How dastardly that is to hear that.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.080]   It's already been an hour here.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.080]   We're approaching 58 minutes.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.440]   I'm looking at it.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:14.280]   We can go on and on and on, but that's not realistic.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.600]   I just want any closing comments, Pastor Peter, Pastor Mark?
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:23.260]   I just want to reiterate what Pastor Mark said in the beginning.
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:30.120]   My frustration is not with young Christians who have questions, because our church is
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.360]   filled with people who have a lot of questions.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:37.560]   They're in the beginning process of growing in their faith.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.920]   How do you answer these questions?
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.940]   And this is all part of sanctification.
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:49.240]   My frustration is with people who claim to be leaders, and they are not.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.440]   By definition, they are not.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.720]   A leader is somebody that others look to because they're ahead of you.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.320]   They're ahead of you in faith.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.760]   They're ahead of you in their walk with God.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:08.780]   But when somebody who is ahead of you are saying things, and clearly, by definition,
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.840]   they're not ahead of you.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:18.840]   They're maybe even behind you, but yet they refuse to get off the spotlight.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.440]   Those are the people that I want to give warning to.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:30.280]   And so I want to encourage, and again, we're doing this for our church members, and don't
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:37.280]   be afraid to come and ask questions, just like what Elder James said, even inerrancy.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:41.720]   How are you going to be confident about inerrancy, about the church, why we do certain things,
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:45.520]   why we preach certain things, what the Bible says, if you don't ask.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:51.300]   The Bible welcomes questions, right?
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:55.720]   But don't go from that to, "Now I'm going to lead the church."
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.520]   Don't be asking those questions and then be frustrated that you're not given leadership.
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.960]   Because by definition, that's not where you ought to be.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:08.580]   So again, I just want to reiterate, we welcome questions.
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:14.160]   Those of you who are doubting in your faith, to come and search, seek, ask, knock.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.900]   And Jesus said that he won't answer, he'll open the door.
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:20.840]   And so that still stands, and we welcome that.
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.800]   And that would only strengthen the church.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:29.080]   - Yeah, and you know, just real quick, ask us questions about anything, whether it's
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.140]   inerrancy or evolution or philosophy.
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:37.440]   I mean, anything, and there's no subject that is off limits.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.660]   I just want to just add that real briefly.
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:45.080]   Two things for me, riding off of the topic of leadership.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.520]   For us as leaders here, there's going to be a tension.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.400]   For us too, we're leading, but we have to be humble with it.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.400]   How do you accomplish that?
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:56.360]   Is I make sure that what I am speaking comes from the authority of the scripture, therefore
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.440]   it's not me, right?
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.880]   But the problem that I see with this movement of deconstruction, a lot of times they'll
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:07.160]   ask, sometimes within articles and conversations, they'll say, "Well, scripture says certain
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:11.800]   things like if you're doubting, you're double-minded, that the unbelieving heart is evil," all that
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.040]   kind of thing.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.920]   But even me as a pastor, I doubt, and therefore now it's okay.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:21.120]   And what you see is a legitimization based on you as a leader, right?
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:26.920]   I've mentioned that because a good Christian leader speaks on behalf of God to the people,
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:32.600]   saying this is what the word of God says to you so that you would find life in it, right?
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:33.600]   In Christ.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.920]   The idea there is, but what I see in this movement is, I think it's being popularized
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:44.280]   because some of the leaders more so say things that people can maybe resonate with, and they're
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:49.160]   more so speaking on behalf of the people, saying, "Yeah, that's our struggle too."
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.440]   He's articulating what I'm feeling, right?
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:53.760]   That only goes so far.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.760]   It's so short, right?
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:00.080]   Just like if a pastor gets up in the pulpit and say, "You know what?
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.080]   I'm just like you.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.080]   I struggle with porn.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.860]   I struggle with porn this week."
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:08.660]   You're not going to say, "Oh, even leaders struggle with porn, so it's okay."
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:09.660]   You wouldn't do that.
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.480]   You say, "He shouldn't be leading."
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.060]   But why does a pastor come up and say, "I doubt all of these things."
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:17.060]   Oh, he's a pastor.
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.300]   Even the pastor does, so this is okay.
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:26.040]   We should apply the same consistent standard in all areas, right?
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.760]   So we wouldn't think, "Oh, I committed adultery."
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:32.200]   I happen to be, "Oh, pastors commit adultery too, so that's okay.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:33.800]   That's not okay.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.880]   They shouldn't be in that position."
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.760]   And then my second point, sorry, I'm going a little long here.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.840]   My second point is, my greatest admonition to Christians thinking about this deconstruction
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:50.040]   thing is, there has been an age-old sinful pattern where we pick and choose what we like
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.400]   about God and his church.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.280]   This movement to me is no different.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.760]   Don't call picking and choosing just general doubt or critical thinking.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.680]   Again, there's different forms, and we've already acknowledged there's different degrees
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:07.680]   by which people come to situations where they're doubting or they're hurting and they have
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:08.680]   experiences.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.840]   But what's being promulgated upon some of these articles and these Christian leaders,
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:17.040]   they are picking and choosing, and we dare not do that with God, right?
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:23.200]   And that's the biggest warning and caution, you can't pick and choose and have it on your
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.200]   terms.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:31.280]   You know, I want to kind of just end with a quote by Spurgeon.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.400]   He says a lot of great things on this topic, but this is a shorter quote, but this is Charles
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.760]   Spurgeon in "The Clue of the Maze."
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:44.880]   Charles Spurgeon in "The Clue of the Maze," he says this, quote, "Doubt dims and chills
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.880]   the day.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:53.120]   A fog is over all things, and men move like Egypt's ancients when they felt the darkness.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.280]   Oh, that this mist would lift.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:02.280]   The best we can hope is that the present gloom may pass away right speedily and that the
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:09.360]   cloud may leave a dew behind to nourish a more intelligent and unquestioning faith.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.880]   In this clammy skepticism, no race but the punies can be nurtured.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:21.400]   Men who are greatly good are hillborn and love the fresh air of the mountains of truth."
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.260]   The paragraphs of this little book are not supposed to be an argument.
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:29.720]   It was not my aim to convince an opponent, but to assist a friend.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:36.520]   How I have personally threaded the labyrinth of life thus far may be of helpful interest
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.560]   to some other soul which just now is in a maze.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:47.360]   I hope that by these pages some true heart may be assisted to fight his doubts and gather
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.360]   strength.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:54.800]   Let no man's heart fail him, for the prevalent skepticisms are but specters of the mind.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.600]   Face them, and they fly.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:01.920]   A great poet let fall the expression "honest doubt."
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.880]   How greedily it was clutched at.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:11.000]   Modern unbelief is so short of the quality that it sees the label, and in season and
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.140]   out of season, it has advertised itself as "honest doubt."
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:19.680]   It was in dire need of a character.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:27.160]   Feeble as our voice may be, we lift it on behalf of honest faith.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:30.400]   That's in The Clue of the Maze by Charles Spurgeon.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.920]   There's a lot more quotes here.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.120]   I'm not going to quote them now because then that'll be an hour long.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:43.280]   But if you think about that, what Spurgeon is saying was doubt was in such need of character.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.760]   So some poet just said let's call it honest.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:56.320]   And we view doubt on this pedestal when faith, when faith should be viewed on the pedestal.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:04.040]   So Pastor Mark, can you kind of close us in prayer?
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.040]   Sure.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.040]   That's great.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.240]   Heavenly Father, our faith comes down to you, Lord.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:17.140]   It's you that you have initiated your grace by sending to us your Son, sending to us your
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:21.440]   truth, and we receive it with grateful hands, Lord.
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:28.920]   I pray, Father God, that we would truly be immersed in that love, that we would recognize
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:35.160]   that the biblical authority is not just simply an intellectual exercise, but you revealing
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.660]   yourself through the Scripture.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.200]   That is to us mercy and grace.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:43.240]   And I pray, Father God, that rather than look at it with suspicion, rather than look at
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:46.920]   it with doubt, help us, Father God, to fully trust you.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:50.720]   I pray, Father God, that we actually would hang on every word.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.200]   I pray, Father God, that we would truly bank our entire lives, our future, our livelihood,
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:01.760]   our well-being, whether mental, heart, or more, that we would truly be devoted to you.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:06.440]   I pray for anybody who is struggling because ultimately we struggle with the things that
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.440]   we see with our eyes and experience with our flesh.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:13.280]   But I pray, Father God, that you would provide growth and faith.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280]   More love to you, Lord.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.760]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.760]   Amen.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:17.760]   Amen.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:22.600]   All right, guys, we will see you soon.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:29.800]   As you could probably tell, my podcast equipment for group settings is a little less than my
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.400]   solo gig.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:35.680]   I bring that up because as I was listening to that last portion of the recording, I was
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.280]   worried it might have been a little marred from the background noise, and it does appear
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:43.920]   that more background noise was picked up than I had hoped for.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.600]   You're going to have to forgive me for that since we were recording at church and people
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:53.040]   were getting ready for an event, and they had no idea we were recording.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:15:01.640]   But in any case, as I promised to answer Spurgeon with Spurgeon, here he is, "How then, says
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:05.480]   Spurgeon, am I to make my calling and election sure?
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:11.720]   Why, thus, if you would get out of a doubting state, get out of an idle state, if you would
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:17.080]   get out of a trembling state, get out of an indifferent, lukewarm state, for lukewarmness
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:22.360]   and doubting and laziness and trembling very naturally go hand in hand, if you would enjoy
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:27.280]   the eminent grace of the full assurance of faith under the blessed Spirit's influence
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.360]   and assistance, do what the Scripture tells you, give diligence to make your calling and
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.200]   election sure.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.500]   Wherein shall you be diligent?
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:42.320]   Note how the Scripture has given us a list.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.360]   Be diligent in your faith.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:49.120]   Take care that your faith is that of the right kind, that it is not a creed but a credence,
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:54.160]   that it is not a mere belief of doctrine but a reception of doctrine into your heart and
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.420]   the practical light of the doctrine in your soul.
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:02.240]   Take care that your faith results from necessity, that you believe in Christ because you have
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.640]   nothing else to believe in.
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:10.440]   Take care it is simple faith, hanging alone on Christ, without any other dependence but
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.080]   Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:18.600]   And when you have given diligence about that, give diligence next to your courage, labor
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:23.520]   to get virtue, plead with God that He would give you the face of a lion, that you may
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:29.040]   never be afraid of any enemy, however much he may jeer or threaten you, but that you
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:34.280]   may, with a consciousness of right, go on boldly trusting in God.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:40.000]   And having, by the help of the Holy Spirit, obtained that, study well the Scriptures and
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.360]   get knowledge.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:45.560]   For knowledge of doctrine will tend very much to confirm your faith.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.440]   Try to understand God's Word.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:50.540]   Get a sensible spiritual idea of it.
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.960]   Get if you can, a system of divinity out of God's Bible.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.000]   Put the doctrines together.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.080]   Get real theological knowledge founded upon the infallible Word.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.560]   Get a knowledge of that science which is most despised, but which is the most necessary
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:13.040]   of all, the science of Christ and of Him crucified, and of the great doctrines of grace.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.920]   And when you have done this, add to your knowledge temperance.
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:18.160]   Take heed to your body.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:19.600]   Be temperate there.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.120]   Take heed to your soul.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.640]   Be temperate there.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.180]   Be not drunken with pride.
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:26.240]   Be not lifted up with self-confidence.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.480]   Be temperate.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:32.400]   Be not harsh towards your friends, nor bitter to your enemies.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:38.680]   Get temperance of lips, temperance of life, temperance of heart, temperance of thought.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:39.820]   Be not passionate.
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:43.760]   Be not carried away by every wind of doctrine.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:47.840]   Get temperance, and then add to it, by God's Holy Spirit, patience.
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:53.120]   Ask Him to give you that patience which endures infliction, which, when it is tried, shall
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.680]   come forth as gold.
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:59.040]   Array yourself with patience, that you may not murmur in your sickness, that you may
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:03.800]   not curse God in your losses, nor be depressed in your afflictions.
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:08.640]   Pray without ceasing, until the Holy Spirit has nerved you with patience to endure unto
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.920]   the end.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.480]   And when you have that, get godliness.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.560]   Godliness is something more than religion.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:21.000]   The most religious men may be the most godless men, and sometimes a godly man may seem to
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.640]   be irreligious.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.000]   Let me just explain that seeming paradox.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:32.360]   A real religious man is a man who sighs after sacraments, attends churches and chapels,
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:35.200]   and is outwardly good, but goes not farther.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.840]   A godly man is a man who does not look so much to the dress as to the person.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:44.780]   He looks not to the outward form, but to the inward and spiritual grace.
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:48.460]   He is a godly man as well as attentive to religion.
[01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:53.040]   Some men, however, are godly and to a great extent despise form.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:56.080]   They may be godly without some degree of religion.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:00.920]   But a man cannot be fully righteous without being godly in the true meaning of each of
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:05.120]   these words, though not in the general vulgar sense of them.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.800]   Add to your patience an eye to God.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.800]   Live in His sight.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:15.420]   Dwell close to Him.
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:18.680]   Then to that, add brotherly love.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:22.060]   Be loving towards all the members of Christ's church.
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.460]   Have a love to all the saints of every denomination.
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:31.060]   And then add to that charity which opens its arms to all men and loves them.
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:36.180]   And when you have got all these, then you will know your calling and election.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:42.060]   And just in proportion, as you practice these heavenly rules of life in this heavenly manner,
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:45.580]   will you come to know that you were called and that you are elect.
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:50.340]   But by no other means can you attain to a knowledge of that except by the witness of
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:55.220]   the Spirit, bearing witness with your spirit that you were born of God, and then witnessing
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:20:01.700]   in your conscience that you were not what you were, but are a new man in Christ Jesus,
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:08.540]   and are therefore called and elected."
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:12.220]   That was Charles Spurgeon.
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:19.220]   Now before I end, I want to give into temptation one last time.
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.260]   This is a lot shorter, okay?
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:24.780]   But I want to leave you with some more Charles Spurgeon.
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:30.860]   This is regarding unbelief, and he states this elsewhere in the Clue of the Maze.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:39.180]   In the Clue of the Maze, Spurgeon states, "How is it that no such trophy has ever been
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:42.560]   raised to the honor of unbelief?
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:48.500]   Will the poet of infidelity and the historian of skepticism yet appear?
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:51.820]   If so, what will be their record?
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:57.580]   Working righteousness and obtaining promises are rather out of the line of doubt, and it
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:03.780]   is not likely to endure much suffering to obtain a better resurrection, for it sneers
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.940]   at the mention of such a thing.
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:11.060]   The eulogist of doubt would have to content himself with lower achievements.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:12.860]   But what would they be?
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:16.780]   What hospitals or orphanages has doubt erected?
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:21.120]   What missions to cannibal tribes has infidelity sustained?
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:27.760]   What fallen women or profligate men has skepticism acclaimed and new created?
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:35.960]   Sing, muse, if such a theme, so dark, so wrong, may find a muse to grace it with a song.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:41.200]   The Milton of this subject may well turn out to be like him whom Gray describes in his
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.460]   elegy as mute and glorious.
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:47.340]   By their fruits ye shall know them.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:53.840]   What are the precious outcomings of modern thought, which is the alias for new-fashioned
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.760]   unbelief?
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:00.840]   We hear the shouts of the craftsmen as they repeat their cry, "Great is Diana of the
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.520]   Ephesians!"
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:08.760]   But where are the holy and happy results of the advanced criticism which is so busily
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:16.760]   undermining the foundations of faith?
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.480]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:23.060]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:50.620]   To him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:58.260]   Amen.
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:00.840]   (upbeat music)
