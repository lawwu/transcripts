[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   I think one of the most important factors, as you're trying to interpret any passage
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.560]   of Scripture, is to check the cross-references.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.880]   I think it was John MacArthur who told me years ago that he thought the most valuable
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.120]   English Bible study tool he had is a treasury of Scripture knowledge, which is essentially
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.180]   a book-length collection of cross-references on every verse in Scripture.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.080]   It always helps the interpreter to compare Scripture with Scripture, and the cross-references
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.620]   tell you, usually, where Scripture has said something similar or something that colors
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.920]   the meaning of this text.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.480]   So I would never try to preach on a verse or study a passage of Scripture without actually
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.000]   consulting the cross-references.
