[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.160]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.240]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.360]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited you're here today.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.720]   Now, last September, I flew out to Austin for one of my favorite conferences,
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.000]   FinCon, and while I was there, I managed to catch a keynote from Vanessa Van
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.600]   Edwards.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.240]   Now, I'd never heard of her before, but I was totally captivated.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.360]   So we spoke after the talk and she agreed to come on the show as soon as she
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.720]   finished writing her next book.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.480]   Well, that book came out yesterday, March 1st, and here she is today.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.000]   So who is Vanessa?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.600]   She's the lead investigator at Science of People, a human behavior research lab.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.760]   She's the best-selling author of Captivate, the science of succeeding with
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.280]   people.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.480]   She's taught over half a million people worldwide on how to succeed in business
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.920]   and life by understanding the hidden dynamics of people.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.920]   And she just published her latest book, Cues, Master the Secret Language of
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.280]   Charismatic Communication.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.760]   We're going to talk about how to control and leverage those tiny signals you're
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.320]   sending from your stance or your facial expression to your word choice or your
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.600]   vocal tone to improve your personal and professional relationships.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.440]   We'll also talk about the science behind becoming charismatic, how to optimize
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.760]   even your video call background, and so much more, including her top picks for
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.960]   your next trip to Austin.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.680]   That is a lot to cover.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.920]   So let's jump in.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.560]   Vanessa, thank you so much for being here and congrats on the book launch.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.560]   Oh my goodness.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.600]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.680]   It's like we're celebrating.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.760]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.400]   So I read the title of the book at first, Cues, Master the Secret Language of
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.720]   Charismatic Communication.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.440]   I had two reactions.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.280]   First, yes, please.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.440]   I want to master that secret language.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.080]   But second, and this is my first question for you, what is a cue?
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.400]   I know, I know.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.760]   So a cue, very easy, is the social signal we send to each other.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.840]   So these can be nonverbal, body language, facial expressions, gestures.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.120]   They can be vocal.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.440]   That's the one people mostly forget.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.760]   How we sound, our volume, our pace, our cadence, our accent.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   Verbal, the words we use, those are the cues we're most familiar with.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.320]   And lastly, imagery, colors, fonts, props, what's behind me in my
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.960]   background, those are all imagery cues.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.360]   Wow.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.480]   And what is the tie between cues and this kind of charisma or
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.720]   charismatic communication?
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.360]   So I have always been fascinated by charismatic people.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.760]   That's probably because I do not feel very naturally charismatic.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.840]   I joke that I'm a recovering awkward person, still very much in recovery.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   And I was the kid on the playground who would watch the cool kids and be like,
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.720]   wow, they have that it factor.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.560]   And for many years, I think this is a myth that I'm hoping to bust with this
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.360]   book is I thought you either were born with it or you weren't, you either born
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.640]   charismatic or you weren't.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.920]   And what I've come to learn and what the research also says is no, actually
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.960]   charisma absolutely can be learned.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.280]   And there is a small percent of the population who are born charismatic,
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.120]   like out of the womb.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.280]   They're just like entertaining parties and like name dropping.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.360]   And like they're super charismatic, but most charismatic people actually
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.560]   develop it over time.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.600]   And the way that we do this is through our cues.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.120]   So what I didn't realize is that, and about 17 years ago, I started to catalog
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.320]   the cues that I was seeing.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.320]   And at the very beginning, I had no idea this would end up being a book, by the
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.400]   way, I started a little folder on my desktop called curious cues.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.480]   And these were just cues that I was noticing across business, politics,
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.360]   athletics, that very highly charismatic people were using the same cues over
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.920]   and over again.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.640]   It didn't matter their industry.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.440]   It didn't matter their talent.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.400]   They were using these cues over and over.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.480]   And I thought, what are they doing?
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.200]   How is it they captivate us?
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.640]   How is it they can pop onto an interview or come on video and we immediately
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.480]   want to watch them.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.880]   So a cue is how charismatic people socially signal their charisma to others.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.640]   Yes.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.640]   And I know you've talked in your previous book and a lot about what charisma is.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.040]   Could you kind of break it down?
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.440]   Because like you've said in the past, like, you know, it's something that we
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.040]   all know, but we don't actually have a way to describe.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.640]   And I think that might be a good starting point.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.920]   This is exactly it.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   We, we feel like charisma is like this kind of mysterious behavior, but
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.240]   actually it's not mysterious at all.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.760]   There is a formula for charisma.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.080]   And this, by the way, when I read this in the research, it was like relief.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.240]   So what the research finds is that highly charismatic people, this is
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.000]   research out of Princeton university from Dr.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.440]   Susan Fisk, is that highly charismatic people rank off the charts in two
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.520]   specific traits.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.040]   They have to be both warm and competent.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.520]   So when you meet a highly charismatic person at the same time, they're signaling
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.680]   likeability, trust, worth, collaboration, openness.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.600]   And at the very same time, they're signaling competence, capability,
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.240]   efficiency, productivity.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.600]   And the reason why highly charismatic people are so captivating is they're
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.360]   always hitting that balance.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.880]   We both want to be around them and want to work with them.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.680]   We both trust them and also take them seriously.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.560]   That is the formula for charisma.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.720]   And is there a way someone listening could evaluate where they are?
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.200]   I mean, is it a spectrum?
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.520]   Could you not even be on the spectrum?
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.040]   I think that, um, I like to think of it as sort of a scale.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.520]   So this is what I talk about in the book is that you can either be highly warm
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.000]   leaning or highly competent leaning.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.520]   And this is why there's different flavors of charisma.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.640]   So when you think about warmth and competence, a way to sort of self assess
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.680]   or I'll give yourself a little audit is which sounds more like you ready for a
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.320]   little test.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.600]   Okay.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.960]   So is it called a, would people describe you as collaborative, a team player,
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:37.240]   patient, compassionate, friendly, that's column a column B would people describe
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:44.760]   you as competent, impressive, powerful, efficient, memorable.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.920]   So which column had more?
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.720]   Yes.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.960]   People would describe me as that.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.400]   So usually people have a leaning, right?
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.960]   They have like more warm, more competent, or if you have a mixture of both
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.120]   amazing, you're one of those very rare birds, highly charismatic.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.560]   If I read those two lists, I think this is actually more common.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.280]   If we're really honest with ourselves, this was me.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.560]   If I said those two lists and none of those sounded like you, you're like, I
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.400]   don't think I can genuinely say that anyone would describe me as those things.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.720]   That is okay.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.080]   That's where I was when I first started this research.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.720]   I call that the danger zone.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.800]   You're in the danger zone.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:26.400]   If you don't feel that you are signaling or queuing either warmth or competence,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.280]   and this is the problem of very smart people.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.960]   Most of my students, like I think most of your listeners are high achieving,
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.880]   high earning, high performance, smart, talented, capable individuals.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.080]   The problem is, is that very smart people often rely too much on their ideas.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.160]   They know they have really good ideas.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.440]   They know they have really good training.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.800]   They know they have really good skills.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.600]   So they double down on that.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.320]   But the problem is, is they don't think about how to communicate those ideas.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.640]   So they walk into a boardroom or they go in a presentation or they're asking to
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.880]   raise their rates with clients, or they're asking for a raise from their boss.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.560]   And they don't understand why the other person doesn't see their smarts.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.200]   Cues are how we communicate the warmth and competence of our ideas.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.000]   So I want to get out, get into getting out of the danger zone for people who are on
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.280]   either spectrum, how to fix it, but I thought a good place to start is could you
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.960]   tell me about the cues you brought to this conversation?
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.160]   And I'm hoping that by the time this happens, we'll start putting things out on
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:29.560]   YouTube.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.920]   Maybe someone could watch the video.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.920]   If not stay tuned, it'll happen.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.560]   But what did you bring to set an example of how you wanted to be conveyed?
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.520]   Before Vanessa answers, I just want to let you all know that I was actually able to
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.120]   start putting the videos of all the hacks on YouTube, starting with today's episode.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.520]   So if you want to check it out, just go to all the hacks.com/video to watch.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.840]   And I have video from almost every episode I've done to date.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.800]   So please hit the subscribe button on YouTube and the rest of these videos will
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.840]   be coming out soon.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.800]   Okay.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.040]   I'll get back to letting Vanessa share what cues she brought to our conversation
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.480]   today.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.560]   Sure.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.960]   So actually let's start with vocal.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.480]   So for people who are listening or watching, this would be helpful.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:18.240]   So I know, and the research shows that the way that we say our words, our vocal
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.800]   power is a very important aspect of how people judge our charisma.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.520]   Our vocal cues are really essential for communicating both competence and warmth.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.600]   And so a study that I share in the book, which I'll stay here, cause I just think
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:36.880]   it's mind blowing is they had doctors record 10 second voice tone clips, short
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.440]   clips where they said like their name, where they worked in their specialty.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.480]   So it sounded like this.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.200]   Hi, my name is Dr.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.840]   Edwards.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.240]   I specialize in oncology and I work at the children's hospital.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:46.880]   Okay.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.480]   Very simple.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.400]   It took these clips and they were bold, the words.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.160]   So you could hear the volume, the pace, the cadence, all the vocal cues, but none
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.240]   of the actual words.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.760]   Then they asked participants to listen to these clips and rate the doctors on
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.640]   warmth and competence.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.680]   The two things that we know are essential for charisma.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.440]   What's incredible is imagine this for a second.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.320]   You're given a clip of gobbledygook, right?
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:09.760]   Hello.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.840]   Like I said, the clips kind of sound like a little bit like totally distorted.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.320]   And you're asked, how smart is this person?
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.000]   How friendly is this person?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.080]   Like your base, this is based on almost nothing.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:29.440]   What they found incredibly is the doctors who had the lowest ratings of warmth and
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.320]   competence had the highest rate of malpractice lawsuits.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.680]   Now this indicates, yeah.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.400]   Wow.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.120]   We don't just sue doctors based on their skills.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.280]   We sue doctors based on our perception of their skills.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.800]   And that happens within the first 10 seconds of hearing them.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.640]   So what I brought to this interview, I know that the first 10 words out of my
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.800]   mouth, not only what the verbal cues are, but also how I share those first 10 words
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.560]   are going to set me up for warmth and competence for the entire interview.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.920]   And the biggest mistake that I used to make that I hear a lot of people make on
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.400]   their video calls or on their interviews is they hold their breath and they wait to
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:13.800]   start.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.440]   And then they say their hello on the highest end of their range.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.320]   They go, hello.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.800]   Oh, hi.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.480]   Hi.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.200]   How are you?
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.280]   And then they go down into their lowest range.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:31.280]   So one is when we analyzed video calls and the vocal power behind videos, often
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.920]   people's highest note was the first word.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.360]   So make sure number one, just as I try to do right when I hopped on is as you were
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.360]   saying hello, I made sure to speak on the outbreath.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.760]   So instead of, Hey, I'm happy to be here all the way up here, I was, Hey, I'm so
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.600]   happy to be here.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.200]   Those sound totally different, but they both come from me.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   And that is simply an effect of breath.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.960]   So one is I made sure I was in the lowest end of my range.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.760]   Uh, and then second, I also made sure that, and that's a vocal competence.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.960]   So we are always sitting for lower end of range for, uh, confidence to hear
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.800]   competence, to hear our, is someone feeling good about what they're going to say?
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.640]   Are they holding their breath?
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.280]   Are they nervous?
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.520]   And the second thing is I also try to bring vocal warmth.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.720]   So I truly am grateful to be here.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.600]   I feel very, very supported by you in supporting this book launch.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.640]   And I need your help, right?
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.720]   Like the only way that I can reach your listeners is with you.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:31.640]   So I was keeping that gratitude at the very front of my brain so that when I
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.880]   said, I'm so happy to be here, you could actually, so if you listen, just if you
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.320]   close your eyes for a second, or if you're listening, just listen to the
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.200]   vocal power, smiles, change the timber of our voice.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.440]   They've actually detected that a smile can change the way that your voice sounds.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.880]   We can hear a smile.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.720]   So if I were to say, and this is a mistake that a lot of speakers make, they say
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.560]   verbal words that are good, but they sound bad.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.840]   So they'll say, yeah, I'm so happy to be here.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.240]   Now, verbally, I said, I'm so happy to be here, but I don't sound very happy.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.520]   And someone will hop on a video call and be like, uh, Hey everyone.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.080]   Uh, so happy to have you all here.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.320]   Doesn't sound very happy.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.240]   Like instinctively we're like, no, that doesn't sound very happy.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.360]   Whereas I'm going to smile so you can hear it.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.360]   I'm going to smile all the way up into my eyes.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.080]   An authentic smile reaches all the way up into these, uh, upper cheek muscles.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.520]   So if I smile all the way with my face, all the way up into my upper cheek
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.040]   muscles, and I say, I'm so happy to be here, it sounds different.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.880]   We can literally hear the warmth.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.120]   And so I want to start to pair.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.440]   And that's what I try to do in my interviews is how can we
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.200]   pair our intentions with our cues?
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.600]   That was a long answer.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   Sorry, Chris.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.840]   That was great.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.080]   That's part of what you brought to this.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.200]   And you said the first 10 words are important and you talked a lot about how
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.880]   to deliver them with your breath, with your intonation, with all that, with
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.240]   smiling, what about the actual words?
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:52.880]   Yes.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.280]   Okay.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.480]   So once you have the nonverbal and vocal down, and that's sort of like a
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.840]   foundation, that's how I kind of like to think about it is if you have your
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.400]   nonverbal foundation, your vocal foundation down it, that's a much easier
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.720]   way to deliver almost any kind of verbal content.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.560]   However, your verbal cues matter.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.840]   And so when we look at verbal cues, we instinctively all know
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.880]   that our words matter, right?
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.320]   Like everyone listening can be like, of course our words matter.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:22.040]   But what I don't think we realize is that our words are cues for behavior.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.640]   In other words, especially as we're doing more and more virtual communication,
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.720]   our brains are constantly hunting, searching for listening for how should I
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.880]   act, how should I behave?
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.160]   How should I feel?
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.320]   And what research has found, and this is across a lot of different studies, and
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.920]   this is kind of a fun one that I'll share.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:47.680]   Brian Wansink wanted to know if a verbal cue could change someone's attitude.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.160]   What he did was he blindfolded people in his labs.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.280]   They couldn't see anything.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.680]   And then he gave them a bowl of strawberry yogurt.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.520]   So I actually don't even talk about this study in the book.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.400]   I think it's so fun.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.200]   He gave them a bowl of strawberry yogurt and they're blindfolded and he has them
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.320]   eat the strawberry yogurt.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.280]   So they're blindfolded.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:04.760]   They're eating it.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.440]   They're tasting their strawberry yogurt.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.960]   And then he asked them to rate the yogurt on its strawberry flavor.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.080]   So how strawberry do you feel this yogurt is?
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.320]   59% of the participants rated the yogurt as having a nice strawberry flavor.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.120]   There was a catch.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.040]   The yogurt was chocolate.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.480]   Totally different flavor profile, right?
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.880]   Like it wasn't like strawberry and raspberry.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.080]   It was like strawberry and chocolate, which tastes totally different.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:36.720]   This is the first of many studies that shows that when the brain heard
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.720]   strawberry and then was asked to look for strawberry, the mouth tasted
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.560]   strawberry, why I think this is important is because again, the
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.080]   brain is always looking for cues.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.560]   We're always looking for, how should we feel?
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.240]   How should we taste?
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:51.920]   How should we act?
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.480]   When you set up a calendar invite, the first 10 words of that meeting
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.000]   are the title of calendar invite.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.240]   Like your meeting started the moment someone invited you to that calendar
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.600]   invite, your meeting started the moment someone opened the calendar invite
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.200]   or saw your name in their inbox.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.960]   That's the first 10 words they heard.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.800]   When someone sees your email, the subject, and maybe the opening line,
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.680]   that's your verbal first impression.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.960]   And those matter because people are looking for what's the flavor.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.440]   Is it strawberry?
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.480]   Is it chocolate?
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.000]   What should I be searching for?
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.560]   And so my argument is what if we think about how we want someone to
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:36.120]   feel before, during, and after interacting with us, do we want them to be warm?
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.160]   Do we want to inspire openness and collaboration and trust?
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.080]   You should be using verbal cues in the warm category.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.960]   So if you want a collaborative meeting, call it collab session or team collab.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.720]   If you want in an email to trigger more warmth, say hi team or hi friend or hi
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:01.560]   partner, those labels are actually cuing people to feel in fact, more collaborative.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.360]   It literally prepares their brain for more collaboration.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.000]   On the other side, if you got to get it done, right?
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.160]   If you're like, no, no, no, no warmth today.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.080]   I got to get it done.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.960]   We got to be competent.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.880]   We got to be productive.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.520]   Okay.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.000]   Set people up to be productive, right?
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.360]   Call it a goal session.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.360]   Call it 2022 wins, right?
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.000]   The more that we use, let's be productive.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.880]   Let's get it done.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.280]   I have an agenda attached.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.000]   I can't wait to power through this.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.720]   You're actually helping the other person's brain get ready to win, to
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.080]   power through, to achieve, to be efficient.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.360]   And so I think that that's a gift that we can give people that these verbal cues,
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.760]   especially the 10 first 10 words, not only help you be more charismatic and
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.800]   purposeful, but they're actually setting people up to more successful themselves.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.960]   I feel like I'm in a choose your own adventure novel where I'm like, gosh,
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.480]   there's six places I want to go with this conversation.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.320]   I kind of love that.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.120]   I love it.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.360]   I'll pick one and hopefully we'll come back if we need to, but.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.520]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.320]   the cracks start to emerge.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.440]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.400]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:21.040]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025, one 37,000.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.560]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.920]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.480]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.040]   accounting, financial management, inventory, HR, and more 25.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.160]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.000]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less close their books in
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.720]   days, not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.320]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.920]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.760]   system with one source of truth.

[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.960]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.840]   the companies I've run makes everything so much better.

[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.840]   allthehacks.com/netsuite, N-E-T-S-U-I-T-E.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:33.040]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.760]   is actually so good for you.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.520]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.400]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.360]   to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:49.480]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.920]   250 year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.680]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.040]   toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.520]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.760]   pre-measured quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.520]   and are so travel friendly.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.760]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.480]   Pu-erh for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-erh, which helps kickstart
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:26.640]   digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good and probably
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.280]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.880]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.160]   benefits of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.600]   and then be happy that Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.440]   than all other teas in the world.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.000]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.800]   offers free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:54.400]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.680]   tea samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peak, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:06.240]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.440]   I noticed that nowadays with all these virtual meetings, people show up and the
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.720]   meeting hasn't started and you have this banter back and forth.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.400]   And what I hear you saying about verbal cues is they're going
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.520]   to set the tone of the meeting.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.280]   But I feel like so often the start of it is like, ah, you know, I was so, it's a
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.520]   long day, I got a lot on my plate.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.000]   Is that completely counterproductive to what we should be doing?
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:29.680]   Okay.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.320]   Thank you for bringing this up because here are my least favorite words
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.200]   at the beginning of a meeting.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:35.720]   Are you ready?
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.920]   Like when I hear these words, I want to crumple to the floor and go to sleep.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.320]   Okay.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.440]   Here's what they are.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.240]   We're going to wait while everyone logs on.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.520]   Oh, oh no.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.760]   It's like telling everyone your time isn't valuable.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.480]   My time is invaluable.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.120]   We're going to do nothing for the next few minutes, except
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.280]   worry and check our email.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:05.080]   So one is I want you to work as much as you possibly can to make
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.680]   those first few minutes productive.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.280]   And this doesn't necessarily mean you get started right away, although it can.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.240]   So you can make a rule that when everyone is on, you're starting,
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.480]   you're not waiting for everyone.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.520]   So you can go right into it.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.680]   We don't need to have rapport and chit chat to be charismatic.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.320]   Absolutely not.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.280]   In fact, competence is about productivity.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.240]   It's about getting things done.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.080]   So if you want to install competence, if you're leaning towards competence,
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.080]   you've got to get it done.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.320]   Start right away.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.440]   Like it doesn't have to include rapport.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:37.000]   Another way of being productive is also to have productive rapport.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.520]   Here's what unproductive rapport looks like.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.360]   And this is accidentally happening all over the, all over
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.600]   the place, especially in COVID.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.320]   Unproductive rapport building is when we start off the meeting like this,
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.400]   we're going to wait for everyone to get on unproductive, right?
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.600]   We're all wasting our time.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.600]   And then gosh, those COVID numbers.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.120]   Did you see that the terrible storm that's happening on the East coast?
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.560]   Oh, it's been so busy, huh?
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:08.880]   We accidentally start negative in some of these meetings and that derails
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.520]   any kind of warmth or competence.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.240]   That's danger zone.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:16.480]   Danger zone is when you're using words like stress, busy, complicated, weight.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.160]   You're literally triggering people to think about stress,
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.880]   busy, challenging, weight.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.040]   So what I'd rather you do is if you're going to have that chit chat and let
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.920]   people log on, make it productive, start priming people to get
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.160]   in that right mind space.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.040]   So this could be anyone doing anything exciting this weekend.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.440]   So at least you're priming for some kind of excitement, right?
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.320]   Or you can say what's good guys.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.840]   I think good happening today.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.400]   So in my team calls every Tuesday, we have a team call.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.080]   Every single team call.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.200]   We start with something good.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.760]   And the moment everyone logs on, even if people are straggling in whoever's
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.120]   on the call starts with something good.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.080]   And that's been a great exercise because it's taken unproductive waiting time
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.440]   into very purposeful rapport building.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.280]   It also has changed the nature of waiting in the sense that a lot of our team
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.200]   members have said, instead of checking my email or running through my to do list
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.800]   before I hop on a call, I'm thinking about my something good.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.720]   I'm like, what's good.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.120]   What's good.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:13.520]   What happened?
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.400]   What's something fun I can share.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.040]   And that becomes a way that we can all celebrate.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.800]   It becomes a way that we can all have a win.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.600]   I learn about my team members.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.600]   And so it's only four minutes at the most, but it's taken a sort of like
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:31.280]   feet dragging, sometimes accidentally negative time into purposeful goodness.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.200]   And so whatever that means for you, just make it productive.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   That can be warm.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.160]   That can be competent.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.480]   I just want it to be purposeful.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.800]   And so that's the beginning of the meeting.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.920]   I actually think the most awkward time for me, and maybe this is even true on
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.560]   like personal phone calls with friends is like ending the conversation.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.200]   You had a good conversation, whether it's a meeting or a catch up and you're
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.720]   kind of at the end, it's like, we don't really have anything to talk about.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.720]   I feel like, all right, well, that was good.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.160]   Bye.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:02.720]   Like, is there a way to productively end conversations, work or friends?
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.800]   One of my favorite topics is leaving a lasting first impression.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.000]   So I think that we talk a lot about how to make a good first impression, but a
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.440]   lasting impression is just as important.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.840]   You can have a great meeting, but if it ends a slow, awkward death, just like
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.560]   you're saying, like, so yeah, okay, great talking to you.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:17.880]   Yep.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.720]   Okay, good.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.360]   And bye.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.560]   Like that's a horrible last impression.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.880]   This can work in person.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.760]   This can work on video.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.600]   That can work on the phone.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.600]   The very first thing that you want to do, if you know that you're heading towards
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.200]   the end of interaction is you can use a future mention.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.960]   So typically when someone mentions a future, something in the future, we know
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.920]   that we're about to wrap up.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.600]   So that could be great.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.080]   I'll follow up with you on XYZ that we talked about.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.560]   So we kind of instinctively know, ah, okay, we're getting, we're getting to wrap up.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.960]   It could be, I hope you have a great time this weekend.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.920]   I loved hearing about, about your daughter's softball.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.120]   I hope that's wonderful.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.960]   That could be, well, this has been awesome.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.640]   I hope you have a really nice rest of your day.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.600]   Thanks so much for spending your Wednesday morning with me.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.240]   Right?
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.080]   So it's some kind of future mentioned there.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:04.200]   We instinctively know that that's a wrap up and then it's using, I don't know if
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.720]   this is an official term, but I call it the end tone, like the end tone of voice.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.000]   So the end tone of voice, it's just like what I just said.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.640]   So I'm using a tone of voice.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.000]   It's like, I'm going off.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.840]   So if we were in the middle of a conversation, I'm talking like this,
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.440]   but if we're wrapping up, I'm going to change my tone to sound like this.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.200]   Well, this has been great talking.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.800]   I've absolutely loved it.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.280]   And I'll follow up with everything that we shared.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.200]   And thanks so much for your Wednesday morning.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:34.760]   Like I'm just cuing you with that end tone.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.120]   And that's a really great way for people to know that we're wrapping,
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.600]   wrapping, wrapping, wrapping, wrapping, and we're out.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:46.160]   So we talked a lot about meetings in person, conversation, verbal.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.320]   Does a lot of this also apply to written communication, whether
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.480]   that's emails or text messages?
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.000]   Yes.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.880]   So when we talk about the four different aspects of the book, obviously, if we're
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.720]   in person, we can use all four, right?
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.080]   We can use imagery, the colors we're wearing.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.120]   We can use vocal, non-verbal and verbal.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.280]   In email, we're just limiting the amount of communication modes that we can use to
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.040]   pretty much just verbal and a little bit of imagery.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.360]   I mentioned imagery.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.520]   Cause I think it's also a forgotten one is even fonts have personality.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.680]   There are researchers, real researchers who have looked at
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.120]   the personality of fonts.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.880]   For example, Chris, you want to do a little game?
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.220]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:22.860]   Okay.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:23.680]   I love games.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.880]   What do you think is the least funny font?
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.960]   According to the research, least funny font.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.240]   I'm going to go with Times New Roman.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:33.680]   Okay.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.680]   That was my guess as well.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.180]   Nope.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:42.800]   It is ironically comic sans, comic sans called comic, least funny font.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.080]   They found that when people write things in comic sans, people do not find it
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.120]   funny, even if the joke is funny.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:53.760]   So even our font can come across in our emails, including colors, including
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.320]   images that we might be using in our, like either graphics or icons.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.720]   So sometimes an email, we can have imagery too, not as much as in
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.360]   person or like on a zoom background.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.000]   Like I'm very purposeful about the props I use behind me in my videos, but
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.160]   you can have some of those emails in emails.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.280]   You have to be queuing people constantly, right?
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.120]   An email is so few.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.160]   It's it's only one mode of communication.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.960]   So you have to be really purposeful with it.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.960]   You want to make sure, and this is not just about making your emails longer.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.920]   And the biggest mistake that people make is they try to be charismatic by adding.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.880]   And I don't think that being verbally charismatic is additive.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.120]   It's about being purposeful.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.160]   So it's using words that trigger something.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.640]   I think a lot of our verbal communication has become sterilized, right?
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.720]   So we send emails that are like, hi, I'm following up the proposal.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.000]   I'll send it to you next week.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.120]   Thanks for the meeting.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.440]   Bye.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.160]   Right.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.080]   Like super, super sterile.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.840]   Can you swap out even a couple of words with something that are going
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.480]   to change people's perception and the way that they tested this, the reason,
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.120]   the reason I know that even just a couple of verbal cues matter, this isn't
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.120]   additive, it's just being purposeful is what the researchers did is they had
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.240]   people come into their lab and they split them up into two different groups.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.400]   The first group got a set of basic directions and they had to complete
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.440]   some tasks like math problems and some basic like intelligence tasks.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:17.920]   The second group have the exact same quiz, the exact same questions, but in their
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:24.880]   directions, they swapped out three or four words with achievement oriented words.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:31.200]   So achievement oriented words are words like win, succeed, master, achieve.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.880]   Those are achievement oriented words.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.240]   They just sprinkled them in just a couple of swaps, three or four of these words.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:42.680]   They found that the group that read the achievement oriented words did better on
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.920]   the task, which is insane.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.640]   If that three or four words can make people do better on an intelligence
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:53.920]   test, they worked harder and longer on the problem set and they had more
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.720]   motivation, so they actually enjoyed that problem set more.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:03.880]   The reason I share this is because if three or four words swapped out in a
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:09.880]   subject or your profile, like your LinkedIn profile or your calendar agenda or the
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:15.880]   slides behind you in a presentation, if that can make your folks, your listeners
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.640]   feel more motivated, wouldn't we want to give them that gift?
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.560]   Like what a gift that we can give to the world with our charisma actually makes
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.800]   them more charismatic.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:31.040]   So what I'm hearing is that you can actually have a charismatic email if you
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.520]   have the right balance of words.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.520]   Is it the same thing?
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.280]   Add a little warmth, add a little competence to an email?
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:36.880]   Exactly.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:42.600]   So here's the hack in your subjects, your greeting and your sign off.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.400]   I want you to match the words with your charisma goals.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.960]   If you want to be warm, use warm words.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.760]   Hi partner.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.800]   Good morning team.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.200]   So happy to see you all.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.440]   Best, right?
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.560]   Signing off best, best is a very warm word.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.200]   If you want to be competent, use competent words and your opener and your sign off
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.400]   on words, let's do this.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.760]   Can't wait to work together.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.880]   Those are competent openers and words.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.240]   So yes, you can match your charisma goals in your emails.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:14.080]   And if you want to kind of come off more charismatic, as you say, is the goal to
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.200]   balance what's natural for you with those words.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.760]   So if at the beginning of this conversation, you reflected and said, wow, I'm
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:25.720]   probably more of the competent person, let's add a little warmth, or is the goal
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.120]   to put both of them out there to have a balance in the email?
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:29.680]   Okay.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.440]   So this is where we get into the advanced, the advanced tips.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.760]   So level one, balance.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.240]   So if this is all new to you, I want as balanced as possible.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.040]   So a little bit of warm words, a little bit of competent words, same thing, a
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.040]   really easy hack that we can use here is like on your LinkedIn profile, look at
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.840]   your headline, look at the first two sentences of your LinkedIn profile, count
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.600]   the number of warm words versus competent words.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.280]   Now this is more art than science.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.760]   So we'll get a little bit, um, more creative here, but warm words.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.880]   When I say warm words, I mean, warm words kind of make you feel the worm and
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:08.720]   fuzzies worms, like words like collaborate team best, both together, happy, great.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.840]   Those are warm words.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.120]   They have more warmth in them.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:16.560]   Competent words are words like efficient, streamline, chart, data, science, right?
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.120]   Those are all more competent words.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.720]   So a little art, not necessarily science.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.880]   Actually, I have a glossary in the book.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.480]   If you want a more specific list, I want you to look at your LinkedIn
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.920]   profile and a way to count how many warm words, how many competent words you're
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.480]   using and level one goal is to make it a mix.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.040]   So try to have an equal amount of warm words and competent words.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:39.960]   So even when I was writing the book, I tried to have a balance of warm and
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.840]   competent words on the pages that mattered.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.640]   So in the introduction, in the description behind the book, in the
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.160]   description on Amazon, because I know that I want to hit both warm
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.400]   readers and competent readers.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.680]   So I try to have a balance of both in any and all public facing things,
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.200]   including like my slides.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.640]   So I give a lot of keynotes.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.800]   I have an exact equal balance of warm slides and competent slides.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.200]   My competent slides are graphs and data and research.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.360]   And for every single competent side, I have a warm slide, a personal
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.760]   story, a funny gif, a joke, right?
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.920]   So those balance out.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.080]   So I try to hit that balance level two, and this is for my advanced
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:20.760]   learners is if you are with a VIP, if you're with a boss or an important
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:26.440]   client or important customer, and you really want to respect them
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:31.920]   charismatically, you can dial up into their warmth or their competence.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.440]   So for example, I have some VIPs in my life that are super high in competence.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.360]   And so to respect and honor them when I am engaging with them,
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.760]   I also dial up my competence.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.080]   I still use warmth, but I just sort of edge more into the kind of words
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.280]   and nonverbal that they use to honor and respect where they're at.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.400]   So that's kind of level two.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.120]   That's the ninja, ninja level.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.080]   I actually, I have a practical application that I'm now going to apply this.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.960]   I'm probably more of a warmth writer with an exclamation point at every
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.120]   end of thing, always signing off best smiley faces and everything.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:11.760]   But my takeaway is I'm going to go read like the LinkedIn profile
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.600]   or the bio on the website and try to figure out, OK, is this person
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.280]   that I'm about to email who I don't know?
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.800]   It's really easy if it's your boss, you know, is you're the boss,
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.120]   the person that hugs you when you come in the room, that's super,
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.840]   you know, always talking about life or they very matter of fact, competent.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.560]   But I imagine I could go read the tweets, the blog posts,
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.440]   the LinkedIn profile, identify who this person is,
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.440]   and they probably are going to be less excited about an email
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.320]   filled with exclamation points and smiley faces
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:45.080]   if their entire writing on the Internet is very charts, percents, data science.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.920]   Exactly. So like watching their YouTube video, watching their TED Talk,
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.600]   looking at their profiles, matching them as a much.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.840]   It's a way of literally saying, I want to be on your page.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.400]   I respect you so much that I want to use your language.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.840]   You also made a very good point.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:04.560]   So exclamation points, emojis and words like yay, fab, whoop.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.280]   Those are all warm.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.320]   So they count as one warm point.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.680]   In fact, every exclamation point I count as one warm point.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.880]   So if you have three exclamation points, that's three warm words.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:19.400]   And for my data heads, charts, percent, numbers or data,
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.800]   those count as one competent word.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.480]   So just consider that when you're doing your little audit on your profile.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.040]   Yeah, you could just score an email plus one, minus one.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.200]   And so I love people to do a little audit where I ask them
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.840]   and you can do this after this call is print out your last five
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.400]   important emails that you sent out.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.560]   Whatever five important emails set out, print them out.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:42.400]   Yellow for warm, blue for competent and count them.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.840]   How are you coming across?
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:47.120]   If you have a mostly yellow email, you are coming across as too highly warm.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:47.880]   Right.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.000]   If you have a mostly blue email, you are overwhelming them in competence.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.240]   And remember, the research shows competence without warmth
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.000]   leaves people feeling suspicious.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.480]   That is literally what they found, the people who are super smart
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.160]   but don't have enough warmth.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.280]   They are less likely to believe your competence.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.040]   So all blue is too much confidence.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.560]   And if you have none at all, so no yellow, no blue, it means you're under signaling.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.320]   OK, I'm going to do that after this call.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.320]   Yeah. But before that.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.520]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.240]   And Trade Coffee is a great addition to your new year routine.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.840]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.280]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.200]   that sources the best coffee across the country
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.680]   and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.560]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.760]   so you can enjoy their craft from the comfort of your own home
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.720]   at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.920]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.720]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:55.320]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.200]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.360]   But this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee, Do Stuff in Tahoe.
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.280]   It's called Bark the Moon, and it's so delicious.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.840]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.880]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:17.360]   when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:22.960]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.480]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:31.640]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to Chef David Chang
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.520]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.040]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.440]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.560]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.040]   of microwave cookware from Anyday, I'm a total convert.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.240]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.360]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.200]   from scratch in the microwave.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.240]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.760]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:06.360]   The cookware is 100% plastic free, and you can cook, serve, store,
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.520]   and reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.320]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.760]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure,
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.560]   I highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.480]   It is so good.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.920]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black Ayo Collection
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.560]   they launched last year, you have to check it out.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.320]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.280]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:38.760]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.800]   Before we get back to the episode,
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.560]   I just want to thank you for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.800]   One thing we didn't talk about when it comes to nonverbal cues.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.120]   What about our hands?
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.280]   What about our backgrounds?
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.400]   What about that kind of stuff?
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.600]   Oh, goodness. OK, there's so many things.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.440]   So let's talk about backgrounds for a second is
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:18.120]   I think that first of all, there is a little bit of early research.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.200]   This is kind of new area,
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.760]   but there's a little bit of early research out of Harvard Business Review
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.440]   that found virtual backgrounds that are like blurred or fake
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.280]   increase our cognitive load.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.640]   It's our brain wants to see what's behind you.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.560]   So if you have a blurred out background or a fake background, it's like
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:37.160]   the other person can't help but be like, what's back there?
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.680]   What's going on back there?
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.360]   So one is try not to have a fake background.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.240]   Also, your hands disappear sometimes.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.080]   Have you ever noticed that?
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.400]   Like if someone I can't I'm personally not a fan of the blurred
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.320]   the virtual, it kind of drives me nuts.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.160]   It drives me nuts.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.640]   Like that's I'm so glad you said it. It drives me nuts.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:59.160]   Like if we could all just stop having virtual backgrounds.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.200]   And the research is beginning to show that as well.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.280]   So that's one is I'd rather have it be real.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.600]   Two is you can balance your warmth and competence with your background.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.040]   So remember, like awards, degrees,
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.240]   pictures of you with famous people or books.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.040]   Those are all competence cues.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.920]   You want to balance those out with family photos, a stuffed animal,
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.680]   a game that you put on your desk, what you put on your desk,
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.480]   what you put on behind you.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.280]   Those are also sending signals about your warmth and competence.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.160]   Behind me, I have a world map.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.400]   And this actually is the second way that you can think about props
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.880]   teaching AIDS.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.600]   So I've experienced it with a lot of different props behind me.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.680]   And one thing that I learned early on was that I used to have chemicals
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.760]   behind me for about two years.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.280]   I had my favorite social chemicals.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:49.600]   So I had oxytocin, serotonin and dopamine behind me.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.400]   Super high competence, right?
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.120]   Having chemicals behind me, it was super high in competence,
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.040]   but it intimidated people.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.800]   People were like, I'm not good at science.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.200]   I failed chemistry.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.440]   I don't I don't want to see that.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.560]   So I was accidentally turning people off.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.040]   Then I decided to do a world map because I realized
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.120]   the biggest question I was getting was, are these universal?
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.000]   The funny thing is, the moment I put the map behind me,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.120]   I stopped getting that question.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.720]   This is amazing.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.000]   What does my background say?
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:17.800]   Is it neutral?
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.480]   Is it go anywhere? Neutral.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:23.520]   So I see behind you have some black and white images that look abstract.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.520]   So I know that this is kind of neutral.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.040]   I also see that it's black and white.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.520]   So you're trying to not signal anything too big.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.520]   In fact, I would think as an interviewer, that's great, right?
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.920]   Because you're trying to get the focus to be on the person you're interviewing.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.520]   So I kind of love it.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.080]   Oh, great.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:40.160]   This is all just what we had in the house.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.640]   So that worked out great.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.640]   And hands, anything hands up, down.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.840]   So hands are a really critical part of our charisma.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.440]   I talk about this in my TED Talk.
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:54.400]   If you're I do a whole hand gesture demo in my TED Talk.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.680]   If you're curious about watching it.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.280]   What I really want people to understand about gestures
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.680]   is they are like a nonverbal highlighter.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:06.200]   So gestures add depth of meaning to your words.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.880]   So like a highlighter, you wouldn't want to highlight an entire page.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.840]   So I wouldn't want to just have gestures all the time.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.920]   If I have constant gestures, it's like having a whole page of highlights.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.040]   It's too much.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.920]   Like our brain can't remember any of them.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.080]   What I do want you to think about is how can I add a gesture
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.720]   to underline or emphasize my words?
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:27.160]   So if I'm talking about three things, I'm going to hold up three fingers.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.640]   If I'm talking about a big idea, I'm going to show you how big it is.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.000]   I'm going to hold a big bowling ball big. That's how big it is.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.240]   If something is no big deal, it's really small.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.400]   I don't worry to my customer or clients. No big deal.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.480]   I'm going to hold up a little tiny thing that shows look how small that is.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.720]   It sounds sort of silly,
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:47.720]   but that actually is a way that our brain highlights our important points.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.720]   So I like to think of gestures as highlighters.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.960]   OK, I hope this video is out and people can watch it.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.840]   I'll link to the TED Talk in the show notes in the time we have left.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.080]   I want to do kind of like a rapid fire of a few things
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.760]   that I know that you've talked about.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.240]   And also you mentioned a glossary of words in the book.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.920]   I was surprised a lot of times you look at books and it's just a lot of text.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.080]   You have like pictures of facial expressions and how to rate
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.040]   how people are looking. And so there's actually a lot of like,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.160]   it's not just words, it's stuff that you can't convey all the time.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.640]   So it's fantastic. Definitely check it out.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.080]   Thank you. My rapid fire thing. Yes, let's do it.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:27.520]   They're kind of like hacks that I picked up from you or want to.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.120]   What do you do to get someone to stop interrupting you?
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.280]   You open your mouth like a fish so you can go up.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.000]   We know that usually means someone wants to talk.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.400]   You can also hold your hand up like a stop sign.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.800]   People usually can recognize, oh, they have something they want to say.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.640]   Yeah. And what about where to sit?
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.120]   So where to sit should match your intentions.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.920]   So I have a little seating chart in the book where I break down the Last Supper
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.120]   as an example of seating, because I just think it's like a
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.320]   basically it's a it's a medieval conference table, basically the Last Supper.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.800]   If you're in charge, if you want people to pay attention,
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.280]   you want to be at the head of the table facing the door, facing the door.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.600]   That's the big one people mistake.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.840]   Leaders want to see faces as they come in and they want to see who sneaks out early.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.320]   So that's usually the leadership position.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:15.240]   If you want to be noticed, if you want to influence the influencer,
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:16.440]   you don't want to be in charge.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.320]   You want to sit to their right or their left to call those the flanking positions.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.520]   If you want to challenge the leader or you want to really be seen
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.160]   taking a strong stance, you want to sit opposite the leader
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.880]   or opposite the person who's leading.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.440]   And if you don't want to be noticed, you want to sit along the side out of eyeline.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:34.800]   That was a very, very fast overview of I wish I had visuals.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.480]   I was a very fast overview of that section.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.880]   Yeah, there are visuals in the book.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:39.920]   So check that out.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.720]   Last total tangent.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.880]   You live in Austin.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.760]   I do. I got three questions.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.880]   Best meal, Loro.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.320]   OK, best place for a drink.
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.000]   I don't really drink.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.160]   So I would say Merritt coffee.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.240]   Merritt. OK, perfect.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.440]   I didn't say what kind of drink. That's right.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.880]   And then and then an atypical thing that someone should see or do in Austin.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.840]   Oh, yeah. Stand up paddle boarding along Lady Bird Lake.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.320]   People forget that we have like a ton of water sports here.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.240]   I know people think of Texas is dry, but stand up paddle boarding
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.040]   or running along Lady Bird Lake. Oh, the best.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.240]   Yeah, perfect. So I always like to ask that.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.800]   You mentioned that there are some files and scripts
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.360]   related to cues that you want to give listeners.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.080]   Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.680]   Yeah, sure. So if you go to science of people dot com slash charisma,
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:30.040]   you can actually take the official charisma diagnostic.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:33.160]   So we talked about earlier, how do we know for warmer competent?
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.480]   I have a free diagnostic.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.320]   You can take it as many times as you want.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.360]   I also have a bunch of the bonus material in there.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.680]   So if you go to science, you'll dot com slash charisma, take the official quiz
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.200]   and bonus, have someone in your life take it as you.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.280]   This is a great way to self check.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.480]   You might think you come across as highly warm or highly competent.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.840]   But what does your colleague say? What does your partner say?
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.200]   So screenshot your results and then have them take it as you
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.160]   and screenshot the results they got for you.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.160]   It is a super interesting self check.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.480]   I'm literally going to ask my wife to do that right after this.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.440]   And like people I work with.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.800]   OK, so the book's out.

[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:18.360]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
