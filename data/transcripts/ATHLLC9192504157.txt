[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.060]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.940]   investments.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.980]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.140]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.680]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.240]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of all the hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.360]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited you're here today.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.720]   Now, last September, I flew out to Austin for one of my favorite conferences,
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.000]   FinCon, and while I was there, I managed to catch a keynote from Vanessa Van
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.560]   Edwards.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.240]   Now I'd never heard of her before, but I was totally captivated.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.360]   So we spoke after the talk and she agreed to come on the show as soon as she
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.720]   finished writing her next book.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.480]   Well, that book came out yesterday, March 1st, and here she is today.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.000]   So who is Vanessa?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.600]   She's the lead investigator at Science of People, a human behavior research lab.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.780]   She's the best-selling author of Captivate, the science of succeeding with
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.280]   people.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.480]   She's taught over half a million people worldwide on how to succeed in business
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.880]   and life by understanding the hidden dynamics of people.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.880]   And she just published her latest book, Cues, Master the Secret Language of
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.240]   Charismatic Communication.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.720]   We're going to talk about how to control and leverage those tiny signals you're
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.280]   sending from your stance or your facial expression to your word choice or your
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.600]   vocal tone to improve your personal and professional relationships.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.400]   We'll also talk about the science behind becoming charismatic, how to optimize
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.720]   even your video call background, and so much more, including her top picks for
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.920]   your next trip to Austin.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.640]   That is a lot to cover.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.920]   So let's jump in.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.520]   Vanessa, thank you so much for being here and congrats on the book launch.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   Oh my goodness.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.560]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.640]   It's like we're celebrating.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.720]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.360]   So I read the title of the book at first, Cues, Master the Secret Language of
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.680]   Charismatic Communication.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.400]   I had two reactions.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.000]   Tell us.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.240]   Yes, please.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.400]   I want to master that secret language.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.080]   But second, and this is my first question for you, what is a cue?
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.400]   I know, I know.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.720]   So a cue, very easy, is the social signal we send to each other.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.840]   So these can be non-verbal, body language, facial expressions, gestures.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.080]   They can be vocal.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.440]   That's the one people mostly forget.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.720]   How we sound, our volume, our pace, our cadence, our accent.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.760]   Verbal, the words we use, those are the cues we're most familiar with.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.320]   And lastly, imagery, colors, fonts, props, what's behind me in my
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.920]   background, those are all imagery cues.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.360]   Wow.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.440]   And what is the tie between cues and this kind of charisma or
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.720]   charismatic communication?
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.360]   So I have always been fascinated by charismatic people.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.760]   That's probably because I do not feel very naturally charismatic.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.840]   I joke that I'm a recovering awkward person, still very much in recovery.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   And I was the kid on the playground who would watch the cool kids and be like,
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.720]   wow, they have that it factor.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.560]   And for many years, I think this is a myth that I'm hoping to bust with this
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.360]   book is I thought you either were born with it or you weren't, you either born
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.640]   charismatic or you weren't.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.920]   And what I've come to learn and what the research also says is no, actually
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.960]   charisma absolutely can be learned.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.280]   And there is a small percent of the population who are born charismatic,
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.120]   like out of the womb.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.280]   They're just like entertaining parties and like name dropping.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.360]   And like they're super charismatic, but most charismatic people actually
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.560]   develop it over time.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.600]   And the way that we do this is through our cues.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.120]   So what I didn't realize is that, and about 17 years ago, I started to catalog
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.320]   the cues that I was seeing.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.320]   And at the very beginning, I had no idea this would end up being a book, by the
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.400]   way, I started a little folder on my desktop called curious cues.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.480]   And these were just cues that I was noticing across business, politics,
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.360]   athletics, that very highly charismatic people were using the same cues over
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.920]   and over again.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.640]   It didn't matter their industry.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.440]   It didn't matter their talent.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.400]   They were using these cues over and over.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.480]   And I thought, what are they doing?
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.200]   How is it they captivate us?
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.640]   How is it they can pop onto an interview or come on video and we immediately
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.480]   want to watch them.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.880]   So a cue is how charismatic people socially signal their charisma to others.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.640]   Yes.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.640]   And I know you've talked in your previous book and a lot about what charisma is.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.040]   Could you kind of break it down?
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.040]   Because like you've said in the past, you know, it's something that we all know,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.040]   but we don't actually have a way to describe.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.640]   And I think that might be a good starting point.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.960]   This is exactly it.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.920]   We, we feel like charisma is like this kind of mysterious behavior, but
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.240]   actually it's not mysterious at all.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.800]   There is a formula for charisma.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.120]   And this, by the way, when I read this in the research, it was like relief.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.240]   So what the research finds is that highly charismatic people, this is
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.000]   research out of Princeton university from Dr.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.440]   Susan Fisk, is that highly charismatic people rank off the charts in two
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.520]   specific traits.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.040]   They have to be both warm and competent.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.520]   So when you meet a highly charismatic person at the same time, they're signaling
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.680]   likeability, trust, worth, collaboration, openness.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.600]   And at the very same time, they're signaling competence, capability,
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.240]   efficiency, productivity.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.640]   And the reason why highly charismatic people are so captivating is they're
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.360]   always hitting that balance.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.880]   We both want to be around them and want to work with them.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.680]   We both trust them and also take them seriously.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.600]   That is the formula for charisma.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.760]   And is there a way someone listening could evaluate where they are?
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.200]   I mean, is it a spectrum?
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.560]   Could you not even be on the spectrum?
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.040]   I think that, um, I like to think of it as sort of a scale.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.520]   So this is what I talk about in the book is that you can either be highly warm
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.000]   leaning or highly competent leaning.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.520]   And this is why there's different flavors of charisma.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.640]   So when you think about warmth and competence, a way to sort of self assess
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.680]   or I'll give yourself a little audit is which sounds more like you ready for a
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.320]   little test.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.600]   Okay.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.960]   So is it called a, would people describe you as collaborative, a team player,
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:37.280]   patient, compassionate, friendly, that's column a column B would people describe
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:44.800]   you as competent, impressive, powerful, efficient, memorable.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.000]   So which column had more, yes, people would describe me as that.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.440]   So usually people have a leaning, right?
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.000]   They have like more warm, more competent, or if you have a mixture of both
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.160]   amazing, you're one of those very rare birds, highly charismatic.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.600]   If I read those two lists, I think this is actually more common.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.320]   If we're really honest with ourselves, this was me.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.920]   If I had said those two lists and none of those sounded like you, like you're
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.000]   like, I don't think I can genuinely say that anyone would describe me as those
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.440]   things.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.760]   That is okay.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.120]   That's where I was when I first started this research.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.760]   I call that the danger zone.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.800]   You're in the danger zone.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.440]   If you don't feel that you are signaling or queuing either warmth or competence,
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.280]   and this is the problem of very smart people.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.000]   Most of my students, like I think most of your listeners are high achieving,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.920]   high earning, high performance, smart, talented, capable individuals.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.120]   The problem is, is that very smart people often rely too much on their ideas.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.160]   They know they have really good ideas.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.440]   They know they have really good training.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.800]   They know they have really good skills.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.600]   So they double down on that.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.320]   But the problem is, is they don't think about how to communicate those ideas.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.640]   So they walk into a boardroom or they go in a presentation or they're asking to
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.400]   raise their rates with clients or they're asking for a raise from their boss and
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.560]   they don't understand why the other person doesn't see their smarts.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.200]   Cues are how we communicate the warmth and competence of our ideas.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.000]   So I want to get out, get into getting out of the danger zone for people who are on
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.240]   either spectrum, how to fix it.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.880]   But I thought a good place to start is could you tell me about the cues you
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.960]   brought to this conversation?
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.200]   And I'm hoping that by the time this happens, we'll start putting things out on
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:29.560]   YouTube.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.920]   Maybe someone could watch the video.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.920]   If not stay tuned, it'll happen.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.560]   But what did you bring to set an example of how you wanted to be conveyed?
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.520]   Before Vanessa answers, I just want to let you all know that I was actually able to
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.160]   start putting the videos of all the hacks on YouTube, starting with today's episode.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.520]   So if you want to check it out, just go to all the hacks.com/video to watch.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.840]   And I have video from almost every episode I've done to date.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.800]   So please hit the subscribe button on YouTube and the rest of these videos will
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.840]   be coming out soon.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.840]   Okay.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.080]   I'll get back to letting Vanessa share what cues she brought to our conversation
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.480]   today.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.560]   Sure.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.960]   So actually let's start with vocal.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.440]   So for people who are listening or watching, this would be helpful.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.240]   So I know, and the research shows that the way that we say our words, our vocal
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.800]   power is a very important aspect of how people judge our charisma.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.520]   Our vocal cues are really essential for communicating both competence and warmth.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.640]   And so a study that I share in the book, which I'll say here, cause I just think
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:36.920]   it's mind blowing is they had doctors record 10 second voice tone clips, short
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.480]   clips where they said like their name, where they worked in their specialty.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.520]   So it sounded like this.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.240]   Hi, my name is Dr.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:42.880]   Edwards.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.280]   I specialize in oncology and I work at the children's hospital.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:46.920]   Okay.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.520]   Very simple.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.440]   It took these clips and they were bold, the words.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.200]   So you could hear the volume, the pace, the cadence, all the vocal cues, but none
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.280]   of the actual words.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.800]   Then they asked participants to listen to these clips and rate the doctors on
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.680]   warmth and competence.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.720]   The two things that we know are essential for charisma.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.480]   What's incredible is imagine this for a second.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.360]   You're given a clip of gobbledygook, right?
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:15.840]   Like that's how the clips kind of sound like a little bit, like totally distorted.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.320]   And you're asked, how smart is this person?
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.000]   How friendly is this person?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.040]   Like this is based on almost nothing.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:29.440]   What they found incredibly is the doctors who had the lowest ratings of warmth and
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.320]   competence had the highest rate of malpractice lawsuits.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.400]   Now this indicates, yeah, wow.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.120]   We don't just sue doctors based on their skills.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.240]   We sue doctors based on our perception of their skills.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.800]   And that happens within the first 10 seconds of hearing them.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.600]   So what I brought to this interview, I know that the first 10 words out of my
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.760]   mouth, not only what the verbal cues are, but also how I share those first 10 words
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.560]   are going to set me up for warmth and competence for the entire interview.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.920]   And the biggest mistake that I used to make that I hear a lot of people make on
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.280]   their video calls or on their interviews is they hold their breath and they wait
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:13.800]   to start.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.440]   And then they say their hello on the highest end of their range.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.320]   They go, hello.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.800]   Oh, hi.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.480]   Hi.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.200]   How are you?
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.280]   And then they go down into their lowest range.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:31.280]   So one is when we analyzed video calls and the vocal power behind videos, often
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.920]   people's highest note was the first word.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.400]   So make sure number one, just as I try to do right when I hopped on is as you were
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   saying hello, I made sure to speak on the out breath.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.800]   So instead of, Hey, I'm happy to be here all the way up here, I was, Hey, I'm so
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.640]   happy to be here.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.240]   Those sound totally different, but they both come from me.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.200]   And that is simply an effect of breath.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.000]   So one is I made sure I was in the lowest end of my range.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.800]   Uh, and then second, I also made sure that, and that's a vocal competence.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.000]   So we are always sitting for lower end of range for, uh, confidence to hear
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.800]   competence to hear our, is someone feeling good about what they're going to say?
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.640]   Are they holding their breath?
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.280]   Are they nervous?
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.520]   And the second thing is I also tried to bring vocal warmth.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.720]   So I truly am grateful to be here.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.600]   I feel very, very supported by you in supporting this book launch.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.680]   And I need your help, right?
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.720]   Like the only way that I can reach your listeners is with you.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:31.640]   So I was keeping that gratitude at the very front of my brain so that when I
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.320]   said, I'm so happy to be here, it, you could actually, so if you listen, just
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.320]   if you close your eyes for a second, or if you're listening, just listen to the
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.200]   vocal power smiles, change the timber of our voice.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.440]   They've actually detected that a smile can change the way that your voice sounds.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.880]   We can hear a smile.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.720]   So if I were to say, and this is a mistake that a lot of speakers make, they say
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.560]   verbal words that are good, but they sound bad.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.840]   So they'll say, yeah, I'm so happy to be here.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.240]   Now, verbally, I said, I'm so happy to be here, but I don't sound very happy.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.520]   And someone will hop on a video call and be like, uh, Hey everyone.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.120]   Uh, so happy to have you all here.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.360]   It doesn't sound very happy.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.240]   Like instinctively we're like, no, that doesn't sound very happy.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.760]   Whereas I'm going to smile.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.400]   So you can hear it.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.360]   I'm going to smile all the way up into my eyes.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.120]   An authentic smile reaches all the way up into these, uh, upward cheek muscles.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.520]   So if I smile all the way with my face, all the way up into my upper cheek
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.040]   muscles, and I say, I'm so happy to be here, it sounds different.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.880]   We can literally hear the warmth.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.120]   And so I want to start to pair.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.440]   And that's what I try to do in my interviews is how can we
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.200]   pair our intentions with our cues?
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.600]   That was a long answer.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.560]   Sorry, Chris.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.840]   No, no, it was great.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.080]   That's part of what you brought to this.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.200]   And you said the first 10 words are important and you talked a lot about how
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.880]   to deliver them with your breath, with your intonation, with all that with
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.240]   smiling, what about the actual words?
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:52.880]   Yes.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.280]   Okay.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.480]   So once you have the nonverbal and vocal down, and that's sort of like a
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.840]   foundation, that's how I kind of like to think about it is if you have your
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.400]   nonverbal foundation, your vocal foundation down it, that's a much easier
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.720]   way to deliver almost any kind of verbal content.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.560]   However, your verbal cues matter.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.840]   And so when we look at verbal cues, we instinctively all know
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.880]   that our words matter, right?
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.320]   Like everyone listening can be like, of course our words matter.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:22.040]   But what I don't think we realize is that our words are cues for behavior.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.640]   In other words, especially as we're doing more and more virtual communication,
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.480]   our brains are constantly hunting, searching for, listening for how should
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.840]   I act, how should I behave?
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.120]   How should I feel?
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.280]   And what research has found, and this is across a lot of different studies, and
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.880]   this is kind of a fun one that I'll share.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:47.640]   Brian Wansink wanted to know if a verbal cue could change someone's attitude.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.120]   What he did was he blindfolded people in his labs.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.240]   They couldn't see anything.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.640]   And then he gave them a bowl of strawberry yogurt.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.520]   So I actually don't even talk about this study in the book.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.360]   I think it's so fun.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.200]   He gave them a bowl of strawberry yogurt and they're blindfolded and he has them
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.320]   eat the strawberry yogurt.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.280]   They're blindfolded.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:04.760]   They're eating it.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.440]   They're tasting their strawberry yogurt.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.960]   And then he asked them to rate the yogurt on its strawberry flavor.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.080]   So how strawberry do you feel this yogurt is?
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.320]   59% of the participants rated the yogurt as having a nice strawberry flavor.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.120]   There was a catch.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:25.480]   The yogurt was chocolate, totally different flavor profile, right?
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.880]   Like it wasn't like strawberry and raspberry.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.080]   It was like strawberry and chocolate, which tastes totally different.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:36.720]   This is the first of many studies that shows that when the brain heard
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.720]   strawberry and then was asked to look for strawberry, the mouth tasted
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.560]   strawberry, why I think this is important is because again, the
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.080]   brain is always looking for cues.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.560]   We're always looking for, how should we feel?
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.240]   How should we taste?
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:51.920]   How should we act?
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.480]   When you set up a calendar invite, the first 10 words of that meeting
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.000]   are the title of calendar invite.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.240]   Like your meeting started the moment someone invited you to that calendar
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.600]   invite, your meeting started the moment someone opened the calendar invite
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.240]   or saw your name in their inbox.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.960]   That's the first 10 words they heard.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.800]   When someone sees your email, the subject, and maybe the opening line,
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.680]   that's your verbal first impression.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.960]   And those matter because people are looking for what's the flavor.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.440]   Is it strawberry?
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.480]   Is it chocolate?
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.040]   What should I be searching for?
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:29.600]   And so my argument is what if we think about how we want someone to
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:36.120]   feel before, during, and after interacting with us, do we want them to be warm?
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.200]   Do we want to inspire openness and collaboration and trust?
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.120]   You should be using verbal cues in the warm category.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:50.000]   So if you want a collaborative meeting, call it collab session or team collab.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.760]   If you want in an email to trigger more warmth, say hi team or hi friend or hi
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.600]   partner, those labels are actually cuing people to feel in fact, more collaborative.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.560]   It literally prepares their brain for more collaboration on the other side.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.040]   If you got to get it done, right?
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.200]   If you're like, no, no, no, no warmth today.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.120]   I got to get it done.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.000]   We got to be competent.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.920]   We got to be productive.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.560]   Okay.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.040]   Set people up to be productive, right?
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.400]   Call it a goal session.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.400]   Call it 2022 wins, right?
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.000]   The more that we use, let's be productive.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.880]   Let's get it done.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.280]   I have an agenda attached.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.000]   I can't wait to power through this.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.160]   You're actually helping the other person's brain get ready to win, to power
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.080]   through, to achieve, to be efficient.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.360]   And so I think that that's a gift that we can give people that these verbal cues,
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.800]   especially the 10 first 10 words, not only help you be more charismatic and
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   purposeful, but they're actually setting people up to more successful themselves.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.600]   I feel like I'm in a choose your own adventure novel where I'm
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.880]   like, gosh, there's six places.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.480]   I want to go with this conversation.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.320]   I kind of love that.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.120]   I love it.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.480]   I'll pick one and hopefully we'll come back if we need to, but.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.480]   Getting the crew together.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.080]   Isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.760]   I get it.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.040]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.360]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.440]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.760]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly the go-to app for
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.840]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.880]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.720]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.120]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.080]   want to celebrate that you got through another week with Drizzly, you can make
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.760]   hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list, which means you can entice
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.200]   your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.120]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.360]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.720]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:58.320]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.400]   I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.400]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.320]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.680]   Must be 21 plus not available in all locations.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.160]   I noticed that nowadays with all these virtual meetings, people show up and the
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.440]   meeting hasn't started and you have this banter back and forth.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:21.800]   Yes.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.720]   And what I hear you saying about verbal cues is they're going to set the tone of
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:30.040]   the meeting, but I feel like so often the start of it is like, ah, you know, I was
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.880]   so, it's a long day.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.240]   I got a lot on my plate.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.720]   Is that completely counterproductive to what we should be doing?
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.400]   Okay.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.240]   Thank you for bringing this up because here are my least favorite words at the
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.880]   beginning of a meeting.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.440]   Are you ready?
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.640]   Like when I hear these words, I want to crumple to the floor and go to sleep.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.040]   Okay.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.120]   Here's what they are.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.960]   We're going to wait while everyone logs on.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.240]   Oh, Oh no.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.440]   It's like telling everyone your time isn't valuable.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.160]   My time is invaluable.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.640]   We're going to do nothing for the next few minutes, except worry and check our
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.000]   email.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:13.440]   So one is I want you to work as much as you possibly can to make those first few
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.400]   minutes productive.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.960]   And this doesn't necessarily mean you get started right away, although it can.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.800]   So you can make a rule that when everyone is on, you're starting, you're not waiting
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.160]   for everyone.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.240]   So you can go right into it.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.400]   We don't need to have rapport and chit chat to be charismatic.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.040]   Absolutely not.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.960]   In fact, competence is about productivity.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.920]   It's about getting things done.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.920]   So if you want to install competence, if you're leaning towards competence and you
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.040]   got to get it done, start right away.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.160]   Like it doesn't have to include rapport.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.720]   Another way of being productive is also to have productive rapport.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.240]   Here's what unproductive rapport looks like.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.800]   And this is accidentally happening all over the, all over the place, especially
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.320]   in COVID.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.320]   Unproductive rapport building is when we start off the meeting like this, we're
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.120]   going to wait for everyone to get on unproductive, right?
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.320]   We're all wasting our time.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.320]   And then, gosh, those COVID numbers.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.880]   Did you see that the terrible storm that's happening on the East coast?
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.320]   Oh, it's been so busy, huh?
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:17.360]   We accidentally start negative in some of these meetings and that derails any kind
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.240]   of warmth or competence.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.960]   That's danger zone.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:24.200]   Danger zone is when you're using words like stress, busy, complicated, wait.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:29.120]   You're literally triggering people to think about stress, busy, challenging,
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:29.640]   wait.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.760]   So what I'd rather you do is if you're going to have that chit chat and let
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:37.360]   people log on, make it productive, start priming people to get in that right
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:37.880]   mind space.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.760]   So this could be anyone doing anything exciting this weekend.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.160]   So at least you're priming for some kind of excitement, right?
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.040]   Or you can say, what's good guys.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.560]   Anything good happening today?
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.800]   So in my team calls every Tuesday, we have a team call every single team call.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.920]   We start with something good.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.640]   And the moment everyone logs on, even if people are straggling in whoever's on the
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.840]   call starts with something good.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:06.280]   And that's been a great exercise because it's taken unproductive waiting time into
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.160]   very purposeful rapport building.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.000]   It also has changed the nature of waiting in the sense that a lot of our team
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.920]   members have said, instead of checking my email or running through my to do list
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.520]   before I hop on a call, I'm thinking about my something good.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.440]   I'm like, what's good.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:20.840]   What's good.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.240]   What happened?
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.120]   What's something fun I can share.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.760]   And that becomes a way that we can all celebrate.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.520]   It becomes a way that we can all have a win.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.320]   I learn about my team members.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.680]   And so it's only four minutes at the most, but it's taken a sort of like feet
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:39.000]   dragging, sometimes accidentally negative time into purposeful goodness.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.880]   And so whatever that means for you, just make it productive.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.920]   That can be warm.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.880]   That can be competent.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.240]   I just want it to be purposeful.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.520]   And so that's the beginning of the meeting.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.800]   I actually think the most awkward time for me, and maybe this is even true on like
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.280]   personal phone calls with friends is like ending the conversation.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.440]   You had a good conversation, whether it's a meeting or a catch up.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.520]   And you're kind of at the end.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.440]   It's like, we don't really have anything to talk about.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.480]   I feel like, all right, well, that was good.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:04.880]   Bye.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:10.440]   Like, is there a way to productively end conversations, work or friends?
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.520]   One of my favorite topics is leaving a lasting first impression.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.720]   So I think that we talk a lot about how to make a good first impression, but a
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.160]   lasting impression is just as important.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.600]   You can have a great meeting, but if it ends a slow, awkward death, just like
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.720]   you're saying, like, so yeah, okay, great.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.320]   Talking to you.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:25.680]   Yep.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.520]   Okay, good.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.160]   And bye.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.360]   Like, that's a horrible last impression.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.680]   This can work in person.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.400]   This can work on video that can work on the phone.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.400]   The very first thing that you want to do, if you know that you're heading towards
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.000]   the end of interaction is you can use a future mention.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.520]   So typically when someone mentions a future, something in the future, we
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.720]   know that we're about to wrap up.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.400]   So that could be great.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.880]   I'll follow up with you on X, Y, Z that we talked about.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.320]   So we kind of instinctively know, ah, okay, we're getting, we're getting to wrap up.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.720]   It could be, I hope you have a great time this weekend.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   I loved hearing about, about your daughter's softball.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.920]   I hope that's wonderful.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.720]   That could be, well, this has been awesome.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.400]   I hope you have a really nice rest of your day.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   Thanks so much for spending your Wednesday morning with me.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.000]   Right?
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.840]   So it's some kind of future mentioned there.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.840]   We instinctively know that that's a wrap up and then it's using, I don't
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.960]   know if this is an official term, but I call it the end tone, like the end tone
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.760]   of voice, so the end tone of voice, it's just like what I just said.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.400]   So I'm using a tone of voice.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.760]   It's like, I'm going off.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.600]   So if we were in the middle of a conversation, I'm talking like this,
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.200]   but if we're wrapping up, I'm going to change my tone to sound like this.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.000]   Well, this has been great talking.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.560]   I've absolutely loved it.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.040]   And I'll follow up with everything that we shared.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.960]   And thanks so much for your Wednesday morning.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.080]   Like you're just queuing.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.520]   I'm queuing you with that end tone.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.880]   And that's a really great way for people to know that we're wrapping,
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.000]   wrapping, wrapping, wrapping, and we're out.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.560]   So we talked a lot about meetings in person, conversation, verbal.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.120]   Does a lot of this also apply to written communication, whether that's
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.920]   emails or text messages?
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.440]   Yes.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.200]   So when we talk about the four different aspects of the book, obviously, if
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.160]   we're in person, we can use all four, right?
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.520]   We can use imagery, the colors we're wearing.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.560]   We can use vocal, non-verbal and verbal.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   In email, we're just limiting the amount of communication modes that we can use
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.480]   to pretty much just verbal and a little bit of imagery.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.040]   I mentioned imagery because I think it's also a forgotten one is
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.960]   even fonts have personality.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.200]   There are researchers, real researchers who have looked at the personality of
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:26.600]   fonts.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.400]   For example, Chris, you want to do a little game?
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.240]   Okay.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.160]   I love games.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.320]   What do you think is the least funny font?
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.440]   According to the research, least funny font.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.720]   I'm going to go with Times New Roman.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.160]   Okay.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.160]   That was my guess as well.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:42.440]   Nope.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:50.320]   It is ironically comic sans, comic sans called comic least funny font.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.600]   They found that when people write things in comic sans, he will do not find it
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.640]   funny, even if the dope is funny.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:01.280]   So even our font can come across in our emails, including colors, including
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.840]   images that we might be using in our, like either graphics or icons.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.680]   So sometimes an email, we can have imagery to not as much as in person or
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.840]   like on a zoom background.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.640]   Like I'm very purposeful about the props I use behind me in my videos, but you
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.680]   can have some of those emails in emails.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.800]   You have to be queuing people constantly, right?
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.720]   An email is so few, it's, it's only one mode of communication.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.480]   So you have to be really purposeful with it.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.480]   You want to make sure, and this is not just about making your emails longer.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.440]   And the biggest mistake that people make is they try to be charismatic by adding.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.400]   And I don't think that being verbally charismatic is additive.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.680]   It's about being purposeful.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.680]   So it's using words that trigger something.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.160]   I think a lot of our verbal communication has become sterilized, right?
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.240]   So we send emails that are like, hi, I'm following up the proposal.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.520]   I'll send it to you next week.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.640]   Thanks for the meeting.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.180]   Bye.
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:51.900]   Right?
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.600]   Like super, super sterile.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.560]   Can you swap out even a couple of words with something that are going to
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.080]   change people's perception and the way that they tested this, the reason, the
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.640]   reason I know that even just a couple of verbal cues matter, this isn't
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.680]   additive, it's just being purposeful is what the researchers did is they had
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.760]   people come into their lab and they split them up into two different groups.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.920]   The first group got a set of basic directions and they had to complete
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.000]   some tasks like math problems and some basic like intelligence tasks.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.240]   The second group have the exact same quiz, the exact same questions, but in
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:31.840]   their directions, they swapped out three or four words with achievement oriented
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:38.720]   words. So achievement oriented words are words like win, succeed, master, achieve.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.400]   Those are achievement oriented words.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.760]   They just sprinkled them in just a couple of swaps, three or four of these words.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:50.200]   They found that the group that read the achievement oriented words did better on
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.440]   the task, which is insane.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.560]   If that three or four words can make people do better on an intelligence test,
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:01.440]   they worked harder and longer on the problem set and they had more
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.200]   motivation, so they actually enjoyed that problem set more.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:11.400]   The reason I share this is because if three or four words swapped out in a
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.840]   subject or your profile, like your LinkedIn profile or your calendar agenda
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:22.560]   or the slides behind you in a presentation, if that can make your folks,
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.160]   your listeners feel more motivated, wouldn't we want to give them that gift?
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.080]   Like what a gift that we can give to the world with our charisma actually makes
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.320]   them more charismatic.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:38.600]   So what I'm hearing is that you can actually have a charismatic email if you
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.040]   have the right balance of words.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.000]   Is it the same thing?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.800]   Add a little warmth, add a little competence to an email.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.400]   Exactly.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:50.120]   So here's the hack in your subjects, your greeting and your sign off.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.920]   I want you to match the words with your charisma goals.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.480]   If you want to be warm, use warm words.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.280]   Hi partner.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.320]   Good morning team.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.960]   So happy to see you all best, right?
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.040]   Signing off the best, best is a very warm word.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.680]   If you want to be competent, use competent words and your opener and your sign off
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.880]   on words, let's do this.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.240]   Can't wait to work together.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.360]   Those are competent openers and words.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.720]   So yes, you can match your charisma goals in your emails.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:21.600]   And if you want to kind of come off more charismatic, as you say, is the goal to
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.680]   balance what's natural for you with those words.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.280]   So if at the beginning of this conversation, you reflected and said, wow, I'm
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.280]   probably more of the competent person, let's add a little warmth, or is the goal
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.640]   to put both of them out there to have a balance in the email?
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.240]   Okay.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.000]   So this is where we get into the advanced, the advanced tips.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.320]   So level one balance.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.800]   So if this is all new to you, I want as balanced as possible.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.600]   So a little bit of warm words, a little bit of competent words, same thing, a
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   really easy hack that we can use here is like on your LinkedIn profile, look at
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.400]   your headline, look at the first two sentences of your LinkedIn profile, count
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.120]   the number of warm words versus competent words.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.760]   Now this is more art than science.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.280]   So we'll get a little bit, um, more creative here, but warm words.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.400]   When I say warm words, I mean, warm words kind of make you feel the warm and
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:16.200]   fuzzies worms, words like collaborate team best, both together, happy, great.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.360]   Those are warm words.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.640]   They have more warmth in them.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:24.080]   Competent words are words like efficient, streamline, chart data science, right?
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.640]   Those are all more competent words.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.240]   So a little art, not necessarily science.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.400]   Actually, I have a glossary in the book.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.960]   If you want a more specific list, I want you to look at your LinkedIn
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.440]   profile and a way to count how many warm words, how many competent words you're
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.000]   using and level one goal is to make it a mix.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.560]   So try to have an equal amount of warm words and competent words.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:47.480]   So even when I was writing the book, I tried to have a balance of warm and
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.360]   competent words on the pages that mattered.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.120]   So in the introduction and the description behind the book and the
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.880]   in the description on Amazon, because I know that I want to hit both warm
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.120]   readers and competent readers.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.400]   So I try to have a balance of both in any and all public facing things,
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.920]   including like my slides.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.360]   So I give a lot of keynotes.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.520]   I have an exact equal balance of warm slides and competent slides.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.920]   My competent slides are graphs and data and research.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.080]   And for every single competent side, I have a warm slide, a personal
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.480]   story, a funny gif, a joke, right?
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.640]   So those balance out.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.800]   So I try to hit that balance level two, and this is for my advanced
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.480]   learners is if you are with a VIP, if you're with a boss or an important
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:34.200]   client or important customer, and you really want to respect them
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:39.640]   charismatically, you can dial up into their warmth or their competence.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.160]   So for example, I have some VIPs in my life that are super high in competence.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.080]   And so to respect and honor them when I am engaging with them,
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.480]   I also dial up my competence.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.800]   I still use warmth, but I just sort of edge more into the kind of words
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.040]   and nonverbal that they use to honor and respect where they're at.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.120]   So that's kind of level two.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.760]   That's the ninja, ninja level tips.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.800]   I actually, I have a practical application that I'm now going to apply this.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:10.880]   I'm probably more of a warmth writer with an exclamation point at every end
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.840]   of thing, always signing off best smiley faces and everything.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:20.360]   But my takeaway is I'm going to go read like the LinkedIn profile or the bio
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.200]   on the website and try to figure out, OK, is this person that I'm about to email
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.560]   who I don't know, it's really easy if it's your boss, you know, as you're the boss,
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.880]   the person that hugs you when you come in the room, that's super,
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.600]   you know, always talking about life or they very matter of fact, competent.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.320]   But I imagine I could go read the tweets, the blog posts,
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.200]   the LinkedIn profile, identify who this person is,
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.200]   and they probably are going to be less excited about an email
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.080]   filled with exclamation points and smiley faces
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:52.800]   if their entire writing on the Internet is very charts, percents, data science.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.680]   Exactly. So like watching their YouTube video, watching their TED Talk,
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.360]   looking at their profiles, matching them as a much.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.560]   It's a way of literally saying, I want to be on your page.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.120]   I respect you so much that I want to use your language.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.600]   You also made a very good point.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:12.320]   So exclamation points, emojis and words like yay, fab, whoop.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.000]   Those are all warm.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.040]   So they count as one warm point.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.400]   In fact, every exclamation point I count as one warm point.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.640]   So if you have three exclamation points, that's three warm words.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:27.120]   And for my data heads, charts, percent, numbers or data,
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.520]   those count as one competent word.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.200]   So just consider that when you're doing your little audit on your profile.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.600]   Yeah, you could just score an email plus one minus one and see where you end up.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.520]   I love people to do a little audit where I ask them and you can do this
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.080]   after this call is print out your last five important emails that you sent out.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.280]   Whatever five important emails sent out, print them out.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.120]   Yellow for warm, blue for competent and count them.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.560]   How are you coming across?
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.840]   If you have a mostly yellow email, you are coming across as too highly warm.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.600]   Right.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.720]   If you have a mostly blue email, you are overwhelming them in competence.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.080]   And remember, the research shows
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.160]   competence without warmth leaves people feeling suspicious.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.200]   That is literally what they found, that people who are super smart
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.000]   but don't have enough warmth, they are less likely to believe your competence.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.760]   So all blue is too much confidence.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.280]   And if you have none at all, so no yellow, no blue, it means you're under signaling.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.040]   OK, I'm going to do that after this call.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.880]   Yeah, but before that, before we get back to the episode,
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.640]   I just want to thank you for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.360]   Your support of our advertisers is what keeps this show going.

[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.880]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.840]   One thing we didn't talk about when it comes to nonverbal cues.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.160]   What about our hands?
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.400]   What about our backgrounds? What about that kind of stuff?
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.640]   Oh, goodness. OK, there's so many things.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.480]   So let's talk about backgrounds for a second is
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.160]   I think that first of all, there is a little bit of early research.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.240]   This is kind of new area,
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.800]   but there's a little bit of early research out of Harvard Business Review
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.480]   that found virtual backgrounds that are like blurred or fake
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.320]   increase our cognitive load.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.680]   It's our brain wants to see what's behind you.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.600]   So if you have a blurred out background or a fake background, it's like
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.160]   the other person can't help but be like, what's back there?
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.720]   What's going on back there?
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.400]   So one is try not to have a fake background.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.280]   Also, your hands disappear sometimes.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.120]   Have you ever noticed that?
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.440]   Like if someone I can't I'm personally not a fan of the blurred
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.360]   the virtual, it kind of drives me nuts.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.200]   It drives me nuts.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.680]   Like that's an I'm so glad you said it. It drives me nuts.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.200]   Like if we could all just stop having virtual backgrounds,
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.240]   and the research is beginning to show that as well.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.320]   So that's one is I'd rather have it be real.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.680]   Two is you can balance your warmth and competence with your background.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.120]   So remember, like awards, degrees,
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.320]   pictures of you with famous people or books.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.120]   Those are all competence cues.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.960]   You want to balance those out with family photos, a stuffed animal,
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.760]   a game that you put on your desk, what you put on your desk,
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.560]   what you put on behind you.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.360]   Those are also sending signals about your warmth and competence.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.200]   Behind me, I have a world map.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.200]   And this actually is the second way that you can think about props teaching AIDS.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.640]   So I've experienced it with a lot of different props behind me.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:26.120]   And one thing that I learned early on was that I used to have chemicals behind me
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.360]   for about two years. I had my favorite social chemicals.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:32.640]   So I had oxytocin, serotonin and dopamine behind me.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.440]   Super high competence, right?
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.200]   Having chemicals behind me, it was super high in competence,
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.640]   but it intimidated people. People were like, I'm not good at science.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.080]   I failed chemistry. I don't I don't want to see that.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.600]   So I was accidentally turning people off.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.960]   Then I decided to do a world map because I realized the biggest question
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.160]   I was getting was, are these universal?
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.080]   The funny thing is, the moment I put the map behind me,
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.200]   I stopped getting that question.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.040]   This is amazing. What does my background say?
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.560]   Is it neutral? Is it go anywhere? Neutral.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:06.600]   So it's a place you behind you have some black and white images look abstract.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.600]   So I know that this is kind of neutral.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.120]   I also see that it's black and white.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.600]   So you're trying to not signal anything too big.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.600]   In fact, I would think as an interviewer, that's great, right?
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.000]   Because you're trying to get the focus to be on the person you're interviewing.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.800]   So I kind of love it.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:23.240]   Oh, great. This is all just what we had in the house.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.720]   So that worked out great.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.720]   And hands, anything, hands up, down.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.920]   So hands are a really critical part of our charisma.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.520]   I talk about this in my TED talk.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:37.520]   If you're I do a whole hand gesture demo in my TED talk,
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.800]   if you're curious about watching it.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.840]   What I really want people to understand about gestures is
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.800]   they are like a nonverbal highlighter.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.320]   So gestures add depth of meaning to your words.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.000]   So like a highlighter, you wouldn't want to highlight an entire page.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.960]   So I wouldn't want to just have gestures all the time.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.040]   If I have constant gestures, it's like having a whole page of highlights.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.600]   It's too much. Like our brain can't remember any of them.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.160]   But I do want you to think about is how can I add a gesture
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.800]   to underline or emphasize my words?
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.280]   So if I'm talking about three things, I'm going to hold up three fingers.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.760]   If I'm talking about a big idea, I'm going to show you how big it is.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.120]   I'm going to hold a big bowling ball big. That's how big it is.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.360]   If something is no big deal, it's really small.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.520]   I don't worry to my customer or clients. No big deal.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.560]   I'm going to hold up a little tiny thing that shows look how small that is.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.840]   It sounds sort of silly,
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.840]   but that actually is a way that our brain highlights our important points.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.800]   So I like to think of gestures as highlighters.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.040]   OK, I hope this video is out and people can watch it.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.920]   I'll link to the TED talk in the show notes in the time we have left.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.160]   I want to do kind of like a rapid fire of a few things
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.840]   that I know that you've talked about.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.280]   And also you mentioned a glossary of words in the book.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:52.000]   I was surprised a lot of times you look at books and it's just a lot of text.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.160]   You have like pictures of facial expressions and how to rate
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.120]   how people are looking.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.360]   And so there's actually a lot of like it's not just words.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.200]   It's stuff that you can't convey all the time.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.720]   So it's fantastic.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.400]   Definitely check it out. Thank you.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.280]   My rapid fire thing. Yes, let's do it.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:10.560]   They're kind of like hacks that I picked up from you or or want to.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.200]   What do you do to get someone to stop interrupting you?
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.320]   You open your mouth like a fish so you can go up.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.040]   We know that usually means someone wants to talk.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.440]   You can also hold your hand up like a stop sign.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.840]   People usually can recognize, oh, they have something they want to say.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.720]   Yeah. And what about where to sit?
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:32.200]   So where to sit should match your intentions.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   So I have a little seating chart in the book where I break down
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.400]   the Last Supper as an example of seating.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.280]   And I just think it's like a basically it's a it's a medieval conference table.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.720]   Basically, it's the Last Supper.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.840]   If you're in charge, if you want people to pay attention,
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.320]   you want to be at the head of the table facing the door facing the door.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.640]   That's the big one people mistake.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.880]   Leaders want to see faces as they come in and they want to see who sneaks out early.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.160]   So that's usually the leadership position if you want to be noticed.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.480]   If you want to influence the influencer, you don't want to be in charge.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.360]   You want to sit to their right or their left to call those the flanking positions.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.600]   If you want to challenge the leader or you want to really be seen
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.200]   taking a strong stance, you want to sit opposite the leader
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.920]   or opposite the person who's leading.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:13.480]   And if you don't want to be noticed, you want to sit along the side out of eyeline.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.840]   That was a very, very fast overview of I wish I had visuals.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.520]   I was a very fast overview of that section.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.720]   Yeah, there are visuals in the book, so check that out.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.760]   Last total tangent.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.400]   You live in Austin. I do.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.800]   I got three questions.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.920]   Best meal. Lauro.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:33.320]   OK, best place for a drink.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.040]   I don't really drink.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.200]   So I would say Merritt coffee.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.280]   Merritt. OK, perfect.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.480]   I didn't say what kind of drink. That's right.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.920]   And then and then an atypical thing that someone should see or do in Austin.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.880]   Oh, yeah. Stand up paddle boarding along Lady Bird Lake.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.360]   People forget that we have like a ton of water sports here.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.320]   I know people think of Texas is dry, but stand up paddle boarding
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.120]   or running along Lady Bird Lake. Oh, the best.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.320]   Yeah, perfect. So I always like to ask that.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.760]   You mentioned that there are some files and scripts related to cues
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.560]   that you want to give listeners.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.200]   Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.760]   Yeah, sure. So if you go to science of people dot com slash charisma,
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.120]   you can actually take the official charisma diagnostic.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.720]   So we talked about earlier.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.280]   How do we know for warmer competent?
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.600]   I have a free diagnostic.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.400]   You can take it as many times as you want.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.400]   I also have a bunch of the bonus material in there.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.480]   So if you go to science, you'll dot com slash charisma.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.880]   Take the official quiz and bonus.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.280]   Have someone in your life take it as you.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.360]   This is a great way to self check.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.560]   You might think you come across as highly warm or highly competent.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.120]   But what does your colleague say?
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:35.920]   What does your partner say?
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.280]   So screenshot your results and then have them take it as you
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.240]   and screenshot the results they got for you.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.240]   It is a super interesting self check.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.560]   I'm literally going to ask my wife to do that right after this.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.520]   And like people I work with.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.880]   OK, so the book's out.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.680]   You can get it wherever books are.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.360]   Where can people go to learn more about you and everything you're doing online?
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.680]   Yes. And I also read the audible and I bring a lot of vocal power to that.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.360]   So if you are a listener, please go check that out.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.360]   And then science of people dot com is where we have all of our articles.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.040]   And you also can check out my YouTube channel where I break down
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.240]   cues of Justin Bieber, The Rock, Princess Diana, Britney Spears.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.880]   I have a little fun with what I couldn't get away with in the book.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.880]   So if you want some cues breakdowns, that's my YouTube channel at Vanessa Van Edwards.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   This has been awesome.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.720]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.800]   I really appreciate it.
