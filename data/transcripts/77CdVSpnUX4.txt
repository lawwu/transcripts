[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.560]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.080]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.120]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.040]   Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Craig Heller
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.800]   as my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.880]   Dr. Heller is a professor of biology and neurosciences
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.240]   at Stanford.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.480]   His laboratory works on a range of topics,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.400]   including thermoregulation, down syndrome,
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.120]   and circadian rhythms.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.400]   Today, we talk about thermoregulation,
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.880]   how the body heats and cools itself
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.660]   and maintains what we call homeostasis,
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.760]   which is an equilibrium of processes
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.560]   that keeps our neurons healthy,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.280]   our organs functioning well.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.000]   And as Dr. Heller teaches us,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.760]   thermoregulation can be leveraged
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.380]   in order to greatly increase our performance in athletics
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.700]   and mental performance as well.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.200]   Learning to control your core body temperature
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.320]   is one of the most, if not the most powerful thing
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.560]   that you can do to optimize mental and physical performance,
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.820]   regardless of the environment that you're in.
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.720]   He also dispels many common myths
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.880]   about heating and cooling the body,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.240]   including the idea that putting a cold pack
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.080]   on your head or neck is the optimal way
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.280]   to cool down quickly.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.880]   And in fact, as Dr. Heller tells us,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.460]   it actually can be counterproductive
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.760]   and lead to hyperthermia.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.400]   It's a fascinating conversation
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.520]   from which I learned a tremendous amount of new information.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.560]   And we didn't even get into the other
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.700]   incredibly interesting work that Dr. Heller does
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.680]   on Down syndrome and circadian rhythms and sleep.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.320]   So we hope to have him back in the future
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.420]   to discuss those topics.
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.460]   As you'll soon see, Dr. Heller is a wealth of knowledge
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.740]   on all things human physiology, biology,
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.400]   and human performance.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.240]   It's no surprise then that he's been
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.200]   chair of the biology department at Stanford for many years,
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.260]   as well as director of the human biology program.
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.920]   So if you're interested in human biology
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.860]   and how to improve your performance
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.320]   in any context or setting, athletic or otherwise,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.160]   I think you'll very much enjoy today's conversation.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.880]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.280]   that this podcast is separate
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.520]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.600]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.520]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.800]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.320]   to the general public.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.400]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.260]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.200]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.300]   Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.860]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.220]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system,
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.460]   and I can tell you that the visual system
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.640]   has to go through a lot of work
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.360]   in order to maintain clarity of what you see
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.760]   when there are shadows,
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.600]   when you go into different types of indoor lighting,
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.440]   and so on.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.060]   And a lot of glasses don't work well
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.280]   because you put them on and then you're in bright light
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.040]   and you can see fine, but then you move into a shadow,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.040]   and then you have to take them off and they don't adjust
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.800]   or they don't adjust quickly enough.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.720]   With Roca, their eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.360]   with the visual system biology in mind,
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.280]   so you always see things with perfect clarity.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.600]   The glasses are also terrific
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.920]   because they're very lightweight
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.280]   and they won't slip off your face if you're exercising,
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.280]   if you're running or biking.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.000]   In fact, they were designed for the purpose
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.440]   of being able to be worn while you're engaging
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.420]   in those sorts of activities or simply working at your desk.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.840]   I happen to wear readers at night
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.360]   when I drive or when I work,
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.800]   and I love their sunglasses
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.280]   'cause I can wear them anywhere.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.600]   And also the aesthetics of their sunglasses
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.920]   and eyeglasses are terrific.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.760]   Unlike a lot of other performance glasses
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.160]   that frankly make people look like cyborgs,
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.000]   the aesthetics on Roca's are really terrific.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.200]   You could wear them anywhere you'd like to go.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.680]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.520]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.960]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.360]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.360]   to help you better understand your body
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.320]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.360]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.640]   And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.600]   you can also analyze your DNA
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.540]   to see what you ought to be doing
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.920]   for your immediate and long-term health.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.760]   We hear a lot these days about optimization,
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.960]   optimizing hormones, optimizing your metabolism,
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.400]   optimizing this, optimizing that.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.440]   But unless you know the measurements of metabolic factors,
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.960]   hormones, and other things that are in your blood and DNA,
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.720]   you don't know what to optimize.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.520]   With Inside Tracker, it makes all of that very easy.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.720]   They can come to your house to take the blood and DNA test,
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.840]   or you can go to a nearby clinic.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.680]   They send you the information and you take those results.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.800]   And unlike a lot of laboratories
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.040]   doing blood work out there and DNA tests,
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.180]   they have a simple platform, a dashboard,
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.160]   that walks you through your results
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.560]   and helps you identify what sorts of nutritional
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.880]   or behavioral or other types of practices
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.600]   you might want to incorporate into your life
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.500]   in order to positively impact
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.480]   your immediate and long-term health.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.180]   It's a very easy system to use,
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.760]   and you will gain a ton of information
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.940]   simply by doing that test,
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.340]   whether or not you end up making changes
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.100]   to what you're doing or not.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.920]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.960]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.920]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.620]   Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.720]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.260]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.760]   vitamin, mineral probiotic drink.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.300]   I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.820]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.480]   The reason I started using Athletic Greens
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.120]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.640]   once or twice a day
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.460]   is because it covers all of my nutritional bases.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.240]   In fact, if people ask me, and I often am asked,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.120]   what supplement should I take?
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.000]   I always recommend Athletic Greens.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.520]   And in fact, if you were to take just one supplement,
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.160]   I recommend Athletic Greens for the simple reason
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.940]   that the vitamins, minerals, and probiotics and adaptogens
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.040]   cover all your nutritional bases,
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.900]   and the probiotics optimize gut brain health,
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.560]   which we now know is essential for mood,
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.260]   for immune system function, for metabolic function.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.580]   It's got so many great things in there.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.640]   I really do feel better
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.280]   when I'm drinking my Athletic Greens.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.380]   I mix mine up with some water, a little bit of lemon juice,
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.960]   and as I mentioned before, I'll drink it once or twice a day.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.200]   If I travel, I might even drink it a third time
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.720]   just because of the additional stress on my mind and body.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.040]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.900]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.480]   to claim a special offer.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.340]   They'll give you five free travel packs,
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.320]   so these are travel packs that make it really easy
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.320]   to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.040]   if you're on the plane or in the car,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.040]   and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.440]   There's now ample evidence that vitamin D3K2
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.040]   is supportive of the immune system
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.120]   and a bunch of other biological functions,
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.700]   and K2 has been shown to be important
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.140]   for cardiovascular health.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.860]   So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.400]   you'll get the Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.360]   and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.780]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Craig Heller.
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.720]   - Great to have you here.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.560]   - It's good to be here.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.400]   - Yeah, it's been a long time coming.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.540]   I know that I and many people have a lot of questions
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.860]   about the use of cold.
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.440]   So one of the things that's happened in recent years
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.640]   is that for many reasons,
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.220]   people have become interested in things
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.680]   like taking cold showers and taking ice baths
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.760]   for many different purposes.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.240]   Sometimes this is introduced as just a general health tonic,
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.760]   but other times people get specific
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.840]   about how it can improve resilience
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.660]   or it can improve one's metabolism.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:31.160]   Could you just tell me a little bit about what happens
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.920]   when I get into a cold shower or an ice bath?
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.920]   What are some of the basic responses
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.860]   at the level of metabolism?
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.500]   Obviously, psychologically, we don't know exactly.
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.840]   It'll vary from person to person.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.180]   But what happens when I submerge myself into an ice bath
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.220]   if I've never done it before?
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.180]   - Well, first of all, you get a tremendous shock.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.720]   And what that's going to translate into
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.300]   is a bit of a shot of adrenaline.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.260]   And I think this is really the so-called benefit,
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.620]   but I wouldn't call it a benefit of the cryochambers.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.800]   You go into a cryochamber and it's a shock.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.220]   So you get a shot of adrenaline.
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.080]   So sure, you're going to feel different when you come out.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.880]   You've had a shot of adrenaline,
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.840]   but it doesn't necessarily translate into any benefit
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.040]   in terms of your physiology or performance and so forth.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.400]   Now, if you take a cold bath or a cold shower,
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.980]   a couple of things are happening.
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.440]   One is you're going to stimulate vasoconstriction.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.040]   So if anything, it's going to make it
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.080]   a little bit more difficult for your body
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.120]   to get rid of heat because you're shutting off
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.240]   your avenues of heat loss.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.520]   If you're in a true cold bath,
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.440]   the overall surface area of your body is so great
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.840]   that it doesn't matter if you've vasoconstricted.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.320]   You're still going to lose heat.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.120]   - Okay, so vasoconstriction, the constriction of,
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.780]   is it capillaries, vessels, and arteries all constrict
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.680]   or just one or two?
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.340]   - Well, this is an area of controversy.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.840]   In general, when people talk of vasoconstriction,
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.360]   they talk of the overall skin surface,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.760]   and that is not true.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.140]   The primary sites of heat loss,
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.080]   which we're going to get into,
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.220]   are the palms of your hands, the soles of your feet,
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.280]   and the upper part of your face.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.760]   And the reason these are avenues for heat loss
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.840]   is they're underlain by special blood vessels.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.760]   And these blood vessels are able to shunt the blood
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.760]   from the arteries, which are coming from the heart,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.960]   directly to the veins, which are returning to the heart,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.880]   and bypassing the capillaries,
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.560]   which are the nutritive vessels, but high resistance.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.240]   So you can tell when you shake someone's hand
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.700]   what his or her thermal status is.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.440]   The hand's hot or it's cold.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.760]   - Do you think that's part of the reason
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.640]   why humans evolved this practice of shaking hands,
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.520]   assessing each other's level of anxiety?
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.040]   We all know that a limp handshake
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.360]   is pretty indicative of something,
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.480]   and a firm handshake is indicative of something,
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.360]   as is the crushing handshake, for that matter, right?
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   - Yeah, I really don't know
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.880]   what the evolutionary origin of handshaking is,
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.680]   other than to get your hand away from your weapon, perhaps.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.720]   - Right, a couple of questions
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.320]   before we get into these specialized vascular compartments
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.840]   on the soles, the palms, and the upper face.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.160]   You mentioned whole body immersion, like into an ice bath
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.880]   or very cold water up to the neck, versus a cold shower.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.560]   Is there something fundamentally different about those two,
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.280]   besides the fact that they both provide
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.780]   this release of adrenaline?
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.900]   Is there anything that's really important to understand
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.700]   about the difference in the physiological response
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.480]   evoked by cold shower versus immersion in cold?
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.380]   - Well, there are differences that are more physical
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.400]   than anything else.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.420]   So if you are in a cold bath and you're still,
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.740]   you develop a boundary layer.
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.080]   If you're in a shower, you can't develop a boundary layer.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.800]   - Could you explain what a boundary layer is?
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.080]   - Yes, it's best to explain it in terms of a hot bath,
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.000]   'cause everybody's experienced that.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.600]   You get into a hot bath and oh my God, it's really hot,
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.640]   almost painful, and then you sit down
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.760]   and eventually it doesn't feel so hot anymore,
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.880]   because the still water, which is close to your skin,
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.200]   is coming into equilibrium with your skin.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.360]   So it's like having a blanket on you or an insulator on you.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.560]   And then if you move around, you disturb that still water
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.880]   layer, you feel the hot temperature again.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.760]   - I see, so if I were to get into a cold ice bath
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.000]   or a very cold body of water of some kind and stay still,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.840]   I'd likely feel warmer, at least until I start-
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.700]   - You're not going to be losing as much heat.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.540]   - I see.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.360]   And then when I move it, I'll say-
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.100]   - If you flail around, if you flail around,
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.440]   then you're going to lose more heat.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.280]   - Got it.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.640]   - Yeah, but I think getting back to your original question
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.800]   about benefits, you have to keep in mind
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.760]   whether you're talking about aerobic activity
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.440]   or anaerobic activity, if you're referring to performance
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.440]   and exercise and so forth.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.960]   So if you're doing aerobic activity that you can sustain
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.960]   for a long time, your production of heat is rising gradually
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.600]   and is being distributed throughout your body.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.060]   So eventually your body temperature is going to come up
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.240]   to a level that's going to impair your performance.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.160]   So the benefit of a cold bath or a cold shower
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.620]   before aerobic activity is that you increase the capacity
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.960]   of your body mass to absorb that excess heat.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.800]   - I see.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.220]   So could you say that in a rough sense that a protocol
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.160]   that one might use if they're going to head out
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.000]   for a long run, even on a reasonably warm day,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.680]   not super hot, or maybe it is super hot,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.980]   would be to take a cool shower before they go run?
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:53.820]   Would that be beneficial?
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.860]   - Sure, it'll take them longer to get to the sweat point
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.780]   and to heat up.
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.040]   - And what will that translate to
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.700]   in terms of a performance benefit?
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.220]   - Well, could increase your speed,
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.860]   or it depends on how you use that benefit.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.620]   Some people are pacers.
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.040]   They will go at the same pace and then they will go farther.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   Or some people are, I want to say, pacers and regulators.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.000]   And no, no, pacers or forcers, they will take that advantage
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.860]   and use it up as fast as they can.
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.420]   So they will go faster, but not necessarily farther.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.260]   - I see.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.400]   As far as I know, not many athletes,
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.740]   at least not the ones that I know,
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.580]   are getting into cool bodies of water,
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.240]   taking cold showers before they head out to train.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.260]   But it sounds like there could be
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.140]   a real performance benefit there.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.620]   - It could be a benefit.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:44.660]   I know we're going to talk about our technology for cooling,
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.980]   but at one point, I don't know if they're using it now,
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.600]   but our cross-country team,
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.720]   when they would go to compete in a very hot place,
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.140]   they would do their warmup exercises, their stretching.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.780]   Then they would extract heat
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.740]   before the beginning of the race.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.220]   So I like to think of it as you have greater scope
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.820]   for heat absorption.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.280]   - Interesting, about how long would one need
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.960]   to take one of these showers or cold immersions
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.180]   before heading out for a run?
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.360]   Roughly speaking, we don't have to get into details
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.620]   because everyone's performance level
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.040]   and regimen is going to be different,
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.740]   where they live is going to be different, et cetera.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.580]   - Right, it's not as long as you think, it's minutes.
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.420]   - Couple minutes.
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.620]   - Yeah, because what's going to happen is
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.920]   as your core temperature goes down,
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.920]   you will eventually shut off your heat loss
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.220]   and that keeps it from going below normal.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.580]   So if you've warmed up and your temperature has risen
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.740]   by half a degree, let's say,
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.700]   it doesn't take more than a few minutes
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.440]   to extract that heat if you're vasodilated.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.920]   - Interesting, and what about for the anaerobic athlete,
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.760]   the strength athlete?
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.000]   - Right, for the anaerobic athlete,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   and let's say they're doing several sets
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.800]   and how many reps, whatever they're doing,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.360]   their core temperature is not going to rise that fast
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.840]   because it's only certain muscles which are being used,
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.820]   but the temperature of those muscles will go up.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.080]   - So it's a local effect.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.720]   - It's a local effect, right.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.760]   - So let's say, for sake of today
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.520]   and maybe for this discussion,
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.200]   if we assume that the basic workout,
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.780]   even though people do variation on this,
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.200]   is five sets of five or 10 sets of 10.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.440]   So for those listening, it would be five sets of 10,
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.080]   of five rep repetitions or 10 sets of 10 repetitions,
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.080]   10 by 10, five by five, yeah.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.960]   So if somebody, let's say,
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.360]   is doing a large body compound movement
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.720]   like barbell squats,
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.040]   where there are a lot of large body movements,
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.700]   hip hinging and et cetera,
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.480]   but for instance, the biceps are not,
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.720]   they're involved, but more or less indirectly.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.600]   - Right.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.400]   - So the effect is going to be to heat up the quadriceps,
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.420]   heat up the hamstrings, heat up the glutes,
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.260]   this kind of thing.
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.600]   - Right. - I see.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.720]   - And then during rest, that heat will leave the muscle,
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.840]   but it's not fast.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.520]   And certainly the heat can't leave the muscle very fast
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.480]   while you're working out because when the muscle contracts,
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.440]   it squeezes the blood vessels.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   And the only way heat gets out of a muscle is in the blood.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.920]   And your muscle metabolism can go up 50 or 60 fold
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.860]   during anaerobic activity.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.800]   That means the heat production in the muscle
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.000]   goes up 50 or 60 fold.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.580]   The blood flow to that muscle cannot go up 50 or 60 fold.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:39.080]   So you literally have the capacity to cook your muscles.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.720]   - So this is probably an appropriate time
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.500]   to just mention briefly
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.340]   what the underlying mechanism of this is.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.960]   Could you just, we will return to the specifics
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.320]   of what one can do to mitigate this heating up,
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.260]   but could you just explain the relationship
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.080]   between energy production ATP and pyruvate kinase
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.040]   and the role of heat there?
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:00.860]   - Sure.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.160]   We don't get something for nothing.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.180]   So like a steam engine,
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.980]   most of the energy in our food is lost as heat.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.100]   So we are roughly about 20% efficient.
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.840]   So of the energy that we take in in our food,
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.440]   about 20% of that can go into doing work
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.880]   and the rest of it is lost as heat.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.520]   Now we're mammals.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.000]   We use that heat to keep our body temperature
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.500]   considerably above the environment.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.160]   But if you raise body temperature a few degrees higher,
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.640]   you're in trouble.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.820]   That's hyperthermia.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.720]   So individual muscles can reach hyperthermic limits
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.520]   before you might experience it in the whole body.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.520]   So to keep you from damaging your muscle by hyperthermia,
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.580]   we have fail-safe mechanisms.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.340]   And one of those fail-safe mechanisms is an enzyme
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.560]   which is critical for getting fuel.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.400]   In other words, the results of metabolism of glucose,
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.840]   getting that fuel into the mitochondria,
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.800]   which is making our major coinage of energy exchange ATP.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.840]   So that particular enzyme is temperature sensitive.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.660]   So when the muscle temperature gets above 39 or 39.5,
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.120]   it shuts off.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.300]   And that essentially shuts off the fuel supply
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.400]   to the mitochondria.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.920]   That's when you cannot do one more rep.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.320]   - So failure, could we say that one component
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.920]   of muscular failure is overheating of the muscle locally?
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.760]   - Right. - There are probably
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.960]   other things too.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.560]   - Well, yeah, if you lack oxygen,
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.040]   but our oxygen delivery is pretty good to the muscle.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.220]   If you run out of glucose, yeah, that's going to impair you.
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:53.220]   But the most immediate impairment of muscle activity,
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.600]   muscle fatigue, in other words,
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.680]   is the rise in temperature of the muscle.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.520]   - Interesting.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.280]   I want to talk about how that muscle fails locally,
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.460]   but I have this burning question in my mind
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.980]   that I cannot seem to answer for myself.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.420]   I'm hoping you can answer it for me.
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:13.040]   So let's say I'm doing five sets of five with squats.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.320]   I hit muscular failure at a given weight.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.400]   And according to what I now know,
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.480]   it's my quadriceps and the muscles associated
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.060]   with the squat that have failed
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.860]   because of this mechanism triggered by heat
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.660]   that shuts off the muscle.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.840]   But my biceps are nice and cool.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.680]   You're telling me.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.080]   They're not doing too much work.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.500]   It's only indirect work.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.920]   So why is it that I can't set the bar down
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.000]   in the squat rack, walk over and do barbell curls
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.640]   with the same intensity that I could
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.040]   if I were to do those barbell curls fresh,
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.980]   not having done anything prior?
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.440]   - Well, you will still have a fatigue curve
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.540]   with your upper body, okay?
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.340]   And that will be influenced by any rise in temperature
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.100]   that has been generated by your lower body exercise.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.900]   - So temperature in both cases is the limiting factor.
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.060]   - It's one limiting factor.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.280]   It's one limiting factor.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.660]   - I find that amazing.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.700]   I find that amazing because I always thought naively
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.700]   that the reason muscles fail is because we, quote,
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.180]   "Don't have the strength to do another repetition."
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.560]   You lack glycogen or some ability to access that glycogen.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.980]   But of course we still have glycogen.
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.180]   It's naive for me to think that
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.500]   because if I wait three minutes and go back,
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.920]   I can do those repetitions again.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.560]   So the glycogen wasn't restored in that three minutes.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.180]   Obviously it was there.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.980]   So I realized there might be other mechanisms involved.
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.940]   Sounds like heat is if not the dominant mechanism
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.220]   that prevents more work.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.520]   It's one of them.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.360]   - It's one of them.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.100]   And it's a quick one.
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.220]   It's a fast one.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.420]   So it can happen with,
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.820]   let's say you are a really experienced weightlifter, okay?
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.380]   You may be doing very, very high weights
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.540]   with sets of five or six.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.740]   - Yeah, to be clear for the audience,
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.540]   I'm not doing very high weights for sets of five.
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.860]   Not particularly strong.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.700]   I'm not super weak, but I'm not particularly strong.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.020]   But Craig's referring in the general sense to you.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:24.020]   So why is it that if I finish a set of squats,
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.800]   I can't simply cool off my quadriceps
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.360]   by throwing a nice cool towel on my quadriceps?
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.500]   Why is that not the best way to go about it?
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:39.100]   - Because your body surface is a very good insulator, okay?
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.860]   We think we don't have fur
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.640]   and therefore we're not insulated.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.640]   But the skin, the fascia, the muscles underneath,
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.940]   they're all very good insulators.
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.560]   And that's why I said earlier
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.580]   that the way the heat gets out of the muscle is in the blood.
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.480]   - So I want to step through a couple other portals
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.660]   by which one might think that heating and cooling
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.220]   would be ideal and then get back to these
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.740]   specialized surfaces on the hands, the feet, and the face.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.860]   So if throwing a cold towel or even ice cold towel
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.320]   on my quadriceps isn't going to work
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.460]   or standing in front of the fan
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.180]   because I'm insulated from that cool,
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.320]   I can't cool off my blood fast enough,
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.700]   what about drinking 16 ounces of ice water?
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.540]   - Sure, you can do that,
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.580]   but you can calculate how much heat that can absorb.
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.020]   And you can't continue drinking liters of ice water.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.480]   You're going to dilute your blood and have other problems.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.760]   But yes, it'll help.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.960]   Sure, it will help.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.960]   But it doesn't have the full capacity you will need.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.520]   - What about an ice pack to the back of my neck
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.620]   or to my head or squeezing the cold sponge over the head?
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.240]   I'm deliberately moving through these options
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.440]   because these are the ones that we see most often.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.540]   We were actually just watching
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.620]   the Olympic track and field trials last night
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.820]   up in Oregon, I'm a huge track and field fan.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:02.820]   And there were a lot of sponges on the backs of necks
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.340]   before and between and after events.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:10.340]   And how good is that or how poor is that as a strategy?
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.760]   Since now we know that being overheated locally
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.400]   and systemically throughout the body
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.300]   is a serious limiting factor on performance.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.060]   - Well, you have to understand something
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.900]   about our thermoregulatory system.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.140]   We have a thermostat just like you have a thermostat
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:30.140]   in your house and that thermostat is in the brain, okay?
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.660]   - Do we know the specific site?
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.500]   - Yes. - Yes.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.580]   - It's called the preoptic anterior hypothalamus.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.320]   It does many things in terms of physiological regulation,
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.760]   but it serves as a thermostat.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.060]   Now that thermostat has to have information.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.700]   It has to have input.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.400]   Where does that input come from?
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.500]   It comes from our overall body surface
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.040]   where we sense temperature, okay?
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.740]   So one of the things that can happen when you're overheated
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.980]   is that you can send in a cold stimulus to your thermostat.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.760]   And that's sort of like wanting to cool your house
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.020]   by putting a wet washcloth over your thermostat.
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.860]   You know, it's doing the wrong thing.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.720]   So we've actually had experiences
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.020]   where we've had people exercising, getting overheated
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.020]   and then cooling the body surface.
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.220]   And they say, "It feels great, this is fantastic."
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.020]   And their core temperature is going up.
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.920]   - Well, I think this is such an important point.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.000]   First of all, I was weaned in a laboratory
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.460]   where there were always battles
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.640]   over the temperature in the lab.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.040]   So people were always putting ice packs on thermostats
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.140]   or putting fans towards thermostats
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.540]   and trying to play this game.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.560]   Good to know we were all being foolish
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.360]   even though we were neurobiologists.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:45.320]   Putting a cold towel over my torso
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.940]   or putting ice on the back of my upper back,
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.840]   you're saying could actually heat up my core.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.120]   - It'll at least decrease your heat loss,
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.960]   your rate of heat loss.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.860]   You're going to raise the issue a little later, I know,
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.120]   and that is our natural portals for heat loss.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.300]   So you can think of the natural portals for heat loss
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.500]   as our air conditioners, okay?
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.140]   The thermostats in the brain
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.700]   and the information to the thermostat
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.420]   is coming from the overall body surface.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.740]   So what can happen if you, let's say,
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.380]   cool the torso with an ice vest,
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.640]   you can actually cause vasoconstriction of your portals,
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.160]   your heat loss portals.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.580]   So that's what impairs the rate at which you're losing heat.
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.820]   It feels good.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.220]   Now back to the head.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.980]   That's really interesting.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.060]   The major blood flow to the brain
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.460]   comes up four arteries through the neck.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.060]   There's the carotid arteries
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.220]   and there's the vertebral arteries.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.060]   So when you put a cold towel around the neck,
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:53.060]   you're going to be putting a cold stimulus into the brain.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.340]   Well, that's great for protecting the brain.
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.100]   You want to protect the brain,
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:01.460]   but it's also going to make you feel cooler than you are.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.620]   So you will think you're ready to go again quickly
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:09.200]   when you've just essentially cooled the thermostat.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.500]   - This is an important point
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.340]   and there's a lot of interest nowadays
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.640]   in people doing marathons
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.460]   and there are even some people do these ultras,
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.240]   ultra running, which I guess is everything longer
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.820]   than a marathon and last man standing,
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.580]   last man, last woman standing kind of things.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.480]   So you're saying that if somebody is hyperthermic,
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.420]   they could trick themselves into subjectively thinking
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.860]   that they are cooling off by putting the cold towel
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.380]   and that they can go further, but their brain could cook.
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.020]   - Well, if they stop the cooling,
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.900]   then that hot blood from the body core
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.380]   is going to go to the brain.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.260]   - Interesting.
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.860]   Well, many, it's a bit of a tangent,
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:48.920]   but many people report after long bouts of exercise
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.740]   or even just very intense bouts of exercise,
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.720]   feeling a kind of brain fog or mental fatigue.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.160]   I assumed that that was due
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.880]   to lowered brain oxygenation post-exercise,
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.080]   but is it possible that there are some post-exercise effects
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.840]   on heating and cooling of the brain
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.060]   that might impact cognition
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.560]   or I should say negatively impact cognition?
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.120]   - It's certainly possible because we know
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:19.120]   that a rise in temperature decreases cognitive capacity.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.000]   I mean, you can experience that yourself.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.400]   You can get on a treadmill and follow your temperature
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.400]   and then just do a simple activity
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.340]   like adding and subtracting.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:33.320]   You get to about 39 degrees, you can't do that anymore.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.560]   You can't just calculate how long
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.700]   you've been on the treadmill.
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.200]   - So the phrase cool, calm, and collected is-
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.040]   - Cool, calm, and collected.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.200]   That's the goal in all pursuits.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.600]   - That's right.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.060]   - So I want to talk about these portals
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.160]   because you've mentioned them a few times.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.260]   Before I ask about what the portals are exactly
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.100]   and how they work
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.280]   and how they can be leveraged for performance,
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.440]   there's a question that my neurobiologist self
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.340]   can't resist but ask.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:05.080]   We have this thermostat in the preoptic area
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.920]   of the hypothalamus, which is interesting to me.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.500]   The medial preoptic area is also one that's known
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.640]   to be sexually dimorphic,
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.400]   dependent on testosterone exposure early in life, et cetera.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.840]   Although people should just note
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.600]   that it's not actually testosterone
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.200]   that creates these sexual dimorphisms, these differences.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.040]   It's actually testosterone converted into estrogen.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.000]   It's actually estrogen is the effector,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.480]   which is fascinating.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.400]   Nonetheless, we've got this area that acts as a thermostat.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.920]   And you said it's collecting information
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.840]   from the whole body.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.160]   Does that mean that there are pathways
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.500]   as the neuroscientists like you and I refer to them
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.080]   as these afferent or input pathways
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.600]   from the body to the preoptic area?
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.640]   Is there a map of our body in the preoptic area?
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.000]   'Cause I have to imagine that you can't have
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.360]   the information just coming from the left shoulder,
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.560]   just from the right toe.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.480]   It sounds like you need probably a pretty crude map
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.160]   but that you need a complete map of the body surface there.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.680]   Well, you don't need a complete map in the hypothalamus.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.600]   I mean, that thermal afferent information that you mentioned,
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.780]   it also goes to the somatosensory cortex.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.940]   So you know if an ice cube has touched you on the back,
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:24.000]   but that doesn't necessarily translate into a change in,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.360]   let's say you're shivering or sweating.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.600]   So the information that's going to the hypothalamus
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:36.360]   is more integrated, representation of body temperature.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.080]   - So it's sort of an average of what's happening
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.560]   across the body. - It's an average.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.580]   - So if I were to, let's say I get hot on a hot day
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.560]   and popsicles when we were in summer camp,
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.440]   I went to a sports camp near here actually
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.900]   and we'd run around like crazy
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.320]   and then we'd get into the shade if we could,
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.880]   but we were popsicles.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.900]   - Brain freeze. - It was all about popsicles.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.260]   Or the kids were putting ice cubes down each other's shirts
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.100]   or something.
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.120]   But that's an average
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.600]   because other parts of the body aren't exposed.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.000]   The mouth is exposed to the ice in the popsicle case
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.640]   or the cold cubes or in the hands.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.480]   As you said, it feels really good.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.320]   - It feels good, yeah.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.640]   - But it sounds like it feels deceptively good
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.600]   because in reality, it could still be quite warm internally.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.240]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.060]   - Interesting.
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.920]   - Yeah, you can feel great
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.440]   and have a dangerously hyperthermic temperature.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.220]   But I should say that when you get into the danger zone,
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.680]   things get bad fast.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.720]   What are some of the symptoms
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.240]   that people could be on the lookout for, for hyperthermia?
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.800]   - Essentially, it's almost ironic
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.800]   that if individuals are transitioning into heat stroke,
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.560]   they actually vasoconstrict and they stop sweating.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.280]   And that's a pathological situation.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.080]   I couldn't begin to explain it.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.940]   But essentially, you are just feeling exhausted.
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.280]   You're feeling miserable.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.080]   The heart rate is very high.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.320]   Your heart rate goes up as your core temperature goes up,
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.860]   called cardiac drift.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.900]   So you just feel rotten.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:21.540]   But that's why, since it's not a danger signal
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.880]   that you can translate immediately into,
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.900]   nope, I'm going into heat stroke,
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.120]   that's why people can overcome their bad feeling
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.560]   with motivation to continue going, to work harder.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.560]   So there have been a number of high-profile athletic deaths
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:42.120]   due to heat stroke that were during practice,
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.360]   not in competition when people are really trying to do it,
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.880]   but in practice,
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.480]   which shows they were just motivated to push.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.880]   - So let's talk about these magnificent portals
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.900]   that not just humans, but other animals,
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.780]   mammals are equipped with.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.340]   So if putting cold on the neck or on the head
[00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:06.440]   or on the torso is not optimal, what is optimal?
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:10.820]   And maybe walk us through a theory
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.380]   as to why we would have these portals located
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.500]   where they are, and then we can talk about
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.140]   how one might leverage them for performance.
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:23.140]   - Okay, where the portals are, are in the glabrous skin,
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.380]   big word, okay?
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.080]   Glabrous just means no hair.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.600]   So it's the hairless skin.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.980]   You say, well, most of my body is without hair.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.880]   No, most of your body has hair follicles.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.240]   We are mammals.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.860]   Mammals have fur.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.240]   We've lost the fur, but we still have those,
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:47.560]   that hairy skin phenotype all over our body, except,
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.100]   except for those skin surfaces
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.880]   where our mammal relatives didn't have fur.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.980]   So the pads of the feet.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.940]   And for the primates, upper part of the face.
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.240]   For rabbits, no portions of the ears,
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.080]   the inner surface of the ears.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.180]   - No, I never thought about that.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.820]   - For bears, the tongue.
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.120]   Bears have big tongues, huge tongues.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.860]   - I didn't know that either.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.460]   I'm in that close to a bear yet.
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.960]   - Yeah, I've had a licking match with a bear.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.500]   - Not yet, no.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.500]   So anyway, our mammalian relatives can't lose heat
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.480]   over their overall body surface.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.180]   So probably very early on in mammalian evolution,
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.600]   they evolved these special blood vessels
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.180]   in the limited surface areas that don't have fur.
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.840]   And as I said, what these blood vessels are,
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.140]   are shunts between the arteries and the veins.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.540]   Arteries and veins are both low resistance vessels.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.460]   So you can have high flow rate.
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.860]   Capillaries, which normally are between arteries and veins,
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.220]   are high resistance because they're very tiny, okay?
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.400]   - Is it fair to say that what I was taught
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.620]   is that blood flows from arteries, then to capillaries,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.740]   and then to veins, and then back to the heart.
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.940]   So it's sort of like from the heart through arteries,
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.780]   then through these little capillaries,
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.660]   which are like little estuaries and streams,
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.420]   and then to the veins, back to the heart.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.780]   Is that generally true?
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.780]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.060]   - So what I learned in basic physiology is still,
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.700]   - I wouldn't get an F in your class.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.620]   - No.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.580]   - Maybe a D or a C, but not an F.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:23.420]   - So that's excellent.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.540]   - Okay, and so you're saying that in this glabrous,
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.300]   or beneath the glabrous skin.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.900]   - There are these shunts.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.860]   - And those go directly from arteries to veins.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.140]   So you skip the capillaries. - Capillaries, yeah.
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:41.460]   - And is it actually, as long as I say that in the skin,
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.900]   you know, when I feel the pads in my hands,
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.180]   how deep to the surface do these vessels reside?
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:54.180]   - They're below the, obviously, the epidermis.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:35:00.120]   So if you are warm and you look at the palms of your hands,
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.320]   they are fairly red.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.340]   The backs of your hands aren't.
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.780]   You don't have these vessels in the backs of your hands.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:11.780]   Now, if you take a glass, like a water tumbler, right,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.660]   and you grab it, you can see if you squeeze a little bit,
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.940]   the hand goes white.
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.540]   That's because you've shut off that blood flow.
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.400]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.900]   I'm going to do that little home experiment.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.240]   - So if you're bicycling on a hot day,
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.860]   you don't want to be grabbing your handlebars all the time.
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.740]   You want to periodically.
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.580]   - Well, this is important.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.300]   I know you're privy to some really amazing results
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.140]   that we're going to talk about,
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.780]   but I actually heard you say this during this lecture
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.660]   recently that Stanford held about human performance
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.260]   that we were both part of.
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.420]   And you mentioned this, that if you're cycling
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.580]   and you're working hard and you want to be able
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:52.500]   to do more work, we now know why you want to remain cool
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.660]   in order to continue to do work.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.760]   And if you get too warm, that's bad.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.180]   That gripping the handlebars too tightly
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.360]   will actually limit your performance.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.240]   And that's probably also true on the Peloton
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.260]   or any other kind of device or the skier
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.860]   or anything like that.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.460]   So loosen the grip, or if you safely can,
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.440]   you want to actually expose your hands to the world.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.220]   Now, what about for people wearing gloves?
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.980]   What about the, to me, that just seems crazy
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.580]   based on everything you're telling me.
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:23.380]   - Well, gloves definitely impede heat loss from the hands,
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.020]   just as socks impede heat loss from the feet, okay?
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.460]   So if you want to maximize your heat loss,
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.460]   you want to have as thin a protectors as possible
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.740]   on your hands.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.440]   And of course the feet are more problematical
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.820]   because you have to be using them in certain ways.
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.580]   - Some people run barefoot.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.420]   - Well, yeah.
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.700]   - Yeah, that's become somewhat popular.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:44.980]   It seems like it kind of came and went.
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.800]   They had those toe shoes things,
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.140]   but they looked so ridiculous that I think most people
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.740]   just were willing to take the performance hindrance
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.700]   of regular shoes.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.820]   - Actually, we had a track coach here at Stanford
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:59.340]   who for a while was famous for introducing training
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.260]   without shoes running. - Interesting.
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.740]   - And he thought it was because it changed the posture
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.860]   of the runner.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.780]   And I think it was just due to the fact
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.780]   that he was increasing the capacity of his runners
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:10.620]   to lose heat.
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.540]   - Interesting.
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.980]   Yeah, so heating up at the level of the hands
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.340]   obviously is going to hinder performance.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.820]   So if I can, how about with running?
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.020]   I noticed I ran across the country briefly in high school
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.040]   and not particularly well at that,
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.420]   but that we were told to run as if we were holding,
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.800]   you know, crackers in our fingers or something,
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.960]   like very lightly and to keep hands kind of loose.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.900]   So running like this would actually be
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.100]   more beneficial performance than,
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.420]   - Or gripping a phone, which is probably
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.680]   what most people are doing nowadays, right?
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.580]   - Right. - Interesting.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:43.980]   And once, I'll tell you the experience I had once.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.580]   I was in Alaska in the winter and I went out running
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:51.380]   and I absentmindedly forgot gloves.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.520]   And I realized this after a short period running
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:58.740]   because the backs of my hands were aching from the cold.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.340]   The palms of my hands were sweating and were hot.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.900]   - Oh, amazing, amazing.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.740]   So these compartments are a real thing.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.900]   And you mentioned the upper half of the face.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.340]   - That's where our primate ancestors don't have fur.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.580]   - And the bottoms of our feet.
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.900]   So let's just take a moment and talk about
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.820]   some of the more amazing results that have been associated
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:23.620]   with proper cooling of these glabrous skin surfaces.
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.100]   - Let me introduce one more thing.
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.240]   - Sure. - Because you asked earlier
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.100]   about the pouring of water on the head, okay?
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.400]   One of the things which is not appreciated fully
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.920]   is that the blood which is perfusing
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.700]   these special blood vessels in the face above the beard line,
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.280]   that's the non-hairy skin,
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:50.220]   that blood then returns in the venous supply to the heart,
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.180]   but it actually does it in a very strange way.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:57.900]   It actually goes through what are called,
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.240]   I'm blocking on the name now.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.080]   - Take your time.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.500]   - These are blood vessels that go through the skull, okay?
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.540]   And that's why the scalp bleeds a lot if you cut the scalp.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.760]   And these blood vessels, which are called,
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.880]   I wanna say emergent, but it's not emergent,
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.420]   it's a word that means leaving.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:18.300]   And these blood vessels were primarily thought to be ways
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.280]   that blood is leaving the brain.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.240]   But when you're overheated, the direction of flow
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.200]   in those blood vessels reverses.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   So the cool blood that's coming from your facial region
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.140]   goes into that circulation
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.260]   and actually is a cooling source for the brain.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.080]   So you can cool the brain,
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.900]   you can have a cooling effect on the brain
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.900]   by pouring water on your head.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.380]   - Interesting, so that practice, which we,
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.520]   at least for me, I most commonly associate
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.060]   with combat sports, where someone,
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.500]   the fighter goes to their corner,
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.940]   they usually sit down on a stool
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:01.260]   unless they're trying to do some mental warfare
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.300]   from the corner, in which case they don't even take a seat,
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:09.300]   and their corner crew will squeeze a glove,
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.580]   excuse me, a sponge full of cold water over them.
[00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.420]   That you're saying is somewhat effective
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.540]   in cooling the brain.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.740]   - Yeah, it's one of the natural mechanisms
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.380]   for cooling the brain.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:23.680]   - I want to return to this at some point as well,
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:27.500]   but is there any known benefit to cooling the brain
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.020]   in terms of offsetting physical damage,
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.460]   offsetting the negative effects of concussion?
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.620]   Because one of the reasons why fighters
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.460]   will often get a cold on the back,
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:41.020]   cold item on the back of the neck or on the head,
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.120]   is not just to cool them down,
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.240]   but the theory is that it might offset
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.480]   some of the damage of neurons.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.760]   - I just can't comment on that.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.820]   I'm aware of those ideas, but they're controversial.
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.740]   One of the things that you want to do
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:01.900]   for injury to the brain is to decrease swelling.
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.180]   And one of the ways that you decrease swelling
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.820]   in many parts of the body is to cool.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:14.060]   It decreases inflammation, it decreases the blood flow.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:18.560]   So, you know, I think it's a really interesting topic,
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.780]   and it's something that should be investigated.
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.380]   It's kind of hard to investigate.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.260]   - Yeah, interesting.
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:31.260]   Okay, so I hear these stories and I've seen the data,
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.520]   so I believe the stories.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.900]   Maybe tell us a story about an observation
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:41.740]   that your group has made with respect to anaerobic exercise
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:46.740]   and proper cooling of these glabrous surfaces.
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.780]   And we can talk about the technology.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.820]   Maybe give us the dips example first.
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.240]   Of course, I think most people are familiar with dips.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.600]   You're supposed to, I guess, get down.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.640]   - Raise and lower your body mass.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.120]   - Yeah, raise and lower your body mass,
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.540]   usually with your legs dangling down.
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.080]   Sometimes people are strong enough
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.320]   to attach a weight there and they'll do,
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.560]   it's essentially a compound upper body exercise.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.400]   - Right.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.580]   - One dip would not be particularly impressive
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:13.660]   for most people.
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:16.300]   100 would be very impressive.
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.240]   20 would be impressive for some, et cetera.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:23.040]   What happens when a skilled athlete comes in
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.180]   and does dips for multiple sets
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.420]   and then what happens when they cool properly
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.580]   using the glabrous skin surfaces?
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:33.580]   - This was a story that occurred early on
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:37.060]   in our investigations when we first made the discoveries
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:41.620]   that cooling has a benefit to increase your work volume,
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.020]   your capacity to do more reps, okay?
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:48.860]   So the word got over, I think, to the 49ers camp
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.660]   and one of their players, Greg Clark,
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.080]   who was a tight end at the time,
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.280]   he had been tight end at Stanford,
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:01.580]   he decided, or I don't know if he was asked or what,
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.980]   to come over and check it out.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:06.380]   So Greg came over and we said,
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.580]   "Greg, what are you good at?
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.860]   What activity do you like to do?"
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.420]   He said, "Dips, I can do a lot of dips.
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.260]   I can do 40 dips in a first set
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.940]   and I can probably do five sets.
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.140]   That's a usual workout for me."
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.420]   And we said, "Okay."
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.820]   So he came over to the gym one day
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.440]   and that's exactly what he did.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:29.440]   He did 40 dips the first set and then maybe 25 and 15
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.760]   and down from there.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.020]   - Do you recall roughly what kind of rest periods
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.000]   he was taking between sets?
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   - Yeah, we standardized the rest period to three minutes
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.880]   because that's what we had set on for cooling
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.720]   as the intervals.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.040]   - That's a good long rest period.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:46.880]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.160]   - Still a lot of dips, I got it.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.200]   - Yeah, it's actually a longer rest period
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:54.040]   than many people would prefer during workouts.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:54.880]   They want to make the most time.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.740]   - Not me, I prefer to take as much rest as I possibly can.
[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.600]   - So several days later, he came back
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:04.880]   and his first set he did, I think maybe 42,
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.060]   a little bit better,
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.980]   but now people were standing around watching.
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.000]   So there was a little impetus there to show off.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.820]   So then his second set was, I don't remember the numbers,
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:19.680]   but very much above the second set on the control day.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.720]   This was after we cooled his-
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.520]   - Okay, so when is he doing the cooling?
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.280]   - He's sitting down and putting his hands
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.840]   in the devices that we had built,
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.760]   which were cooling the palms of his hands.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.440]   - For how long does that cooling take?
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.400]   Can he do it inside of a three-minute rest period?
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.640]   - Yeah, that's what we were doing.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.880]   We standardized the interval for resting or cooling
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.200]   to three minutes.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.840]   Okay, but the point is he got to his fifth set
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.160]   and all of the sets were above
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.560]   what he had done on the previous day.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.900]   And he said, "You know, I'm not tired, I can do another set.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.320]   And then I can do another set.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.780]   I can do another set.
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:58.620]   I can do another set."
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:03.480]   So from one day to two or three days later with cooling,
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.480]   he doubled the total work volume.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.680]   He doubled the total number of dips.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:12.160]   - By adding more sets and more repetitions to each set.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.200]   - Right.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.760]   So then he kept coming back for four more weeks,
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:18.900]   twice a week.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.900]   And by the end of that month, he was doing 300 dips.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:25.660]   - Wow, so what percent?
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:26.500]   - So he tripled.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.240]   - He tripled. - He essentially tripled.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.440]   And so here's a professional athlete
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.240]   at peak physical conditioning
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.840]   and he triples what he can do.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.840]   - Amazing.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.060]   And in terms of his ability to recover,
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:42.080]   was that explored or discussed at all?
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.940]   Because my understanding is that
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:47.740]   if we cause enough stress to a muscle
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.640]   during anaerobic training,
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.100]   we provide the stimulus for compensatory regrowth, et cetera.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.820]   But if we do more work,
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.740]   we essentially scale up the amount of recovery that's needed
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.700]   or the recovery time.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.120]   I'm very curious about whether or not he needed longer
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:05.940]   to recover between these super performing workouts.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:07.500]   - That's very interesting.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.720]   That was a major discovery,
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:13.460]   which we didn't realize we were making at the time.
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.540]   There is this phenomenon you're referring to
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:19.020]   as delayed onset muscle soreness, DOMS.
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.340]   And this is due to those little micro tears and so forth
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:27.340]   that are happening as we extend our workout capacity, volume.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:32.940]   So we've had this experience so many times
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.740]   that an athlete or anyone will come in to the lab
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:40.220]   and they will exceed what their previous goals were,
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:42.140]   their previous expectations.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.900]   And I can always see the words coming out of their mouth.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:47.660]   I'm going to be so sore tomorrow.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.300]   They never are.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.140]   - Interesting.
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.360]   - And we've actually demonstrated that with a naive group.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:58.120]   We had a class, a physical conditioning class,
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.620]   and we had half of them.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:02.980]   The first days of the class,
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.580]   we had to establish their true capacity,
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.140]   what they could do.
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:11.260]   So these were pretty heavy workouts for these new recruits.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.700]   And we gave half of them the benefit of cooling
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.140]   and the other half not.
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:19.300]   And then we had them record their subjective levels
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.180]   of delayed onset muscle soreness.
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.420]   And those that were cooled
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.900]   didn't have significant muscle soreness.
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:26.740]   - Amazing.
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.340]   And I know there are also published results
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.740]   and we will provide links to some of these papers
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.980]   for people seeing similar effects,
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.780]   I should say similar performance enhancing effects
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:40.300]   using bench presses, bench press,
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.700]   or pushups or other sorts of things.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.360]   Maybe you could give us an example
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:48.860]   from the realm of endurance work or aerobic work,
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.660]   running, cycling, things of that sort.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:55.360]   - Well, one of the problems for us
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.720]   is that our equipment now is not really portable.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.020]   I mean, it's portable in the sense
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:03.980]   you can carry it to the gym or to the football field.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:04.820]   - But you're not going to run with it.
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.580]   - But you're not going to run with it, right.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:07.780]   - Or equip a bicycle with it.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.420]   Although when are the cooling handles on bicycles coming?
[00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:11.840]   - Yeah, that would be good.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:15.740]   But one itinerant activity is golfing
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.740]   and people have put it on their golf carts
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.580]   and they're out.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.900]   - Do people really heat up that much in golf?
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:21.740]   - They do.
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.100]   - Not to be disparaging of the golfers,
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.260]   but the way I conceptualize golf,
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.740]   it's like a swing and then a walk
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.500]   and then a cart ride and then a meal.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.740]   I probably just offended all the golfers out there.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:35.280]   - Well, one time we were doing work
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.980]   for the Department of Defense
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:40.580]   and they wanted to check it out
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:43.720]   whether or not what we were doing was really worthwhile.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:48.720]   So they sent out a team of special ops soldiers
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.500]   to be our subjects and test it out.
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.220]   They were here for a week.
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:56.060]   So that was a fun week.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.880]   - Yeah, I do some work with those guys.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.100]   They're hard driving guys.
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.420]   They also know how to have fun.
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:04.900]   But yeah, they definitely have,
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.700]   if they have an off or a quit switch,
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:11.400]   it's buried deep within their nervous system.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.640]   They don't like to hit that quit switch.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.280]   - So the guy who wrote the final report,
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.360]   he gave an addendum to the report and he said,
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.680]   "Well, I'll tell you this, after I've gotten home,
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:24.240]   it's added that technology."
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.660]   They took the technology with them.
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:26.500]   They wanted to keep it.
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:29.260]   - Oh yeah, that sounds about right.
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.640]   - And using it, it has added 20 yards
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.920]   to every club in my bag, and that's no effing small deal.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.160]   - So it's allowing people to hit further,
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.700]   hit the golf ball further.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:40.540]   - Right.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.360]   - Interesting.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:46.640]   All right, so for the golf players out there,
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:52.440]   then that's the reward you get back from Craig
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.040]   for all my little knocks on golf.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.080]   I actually, I don't have any knock on golf.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.280]   I just don't think about it as a sport
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.980]   where heating up is a limiting factor.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:04.560]   So since they're getting more out of their drive,
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.300]   what do you think is going on there?
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.480]   - Well, they can be heating up.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.320]   - And they're wearing gloves, right?
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.880]   - They're wearing gloves on a hot day and so forth.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.660]   But let me just tell you one more serious story
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.360]   about golfers, and that is individuals
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.400]   with multiple sclerosis
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.680]   are exceedingly temperature sensitive.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.520]   - I didn't know that.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.780]   - So they may still be mobile,
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.040]   but they have to stay in cool locations
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:31.220]   and not increase their exercise to any great extent.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.300]   But we've had subjects that have,
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.840]   with multiple sclerosis who have just essentially
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.340]   put the device on their golf cart
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:39.540]   and they're back out playing golf
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:40.540]   in the middle of the summer.
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:41.380]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.880]   - Yeah. - That's great.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.760]   Anything that allows people to have normal levels
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:50.640]   of livelihood and recreation is great.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.480]   We always think about performance
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.460]   at these kind of like peak and elite levels
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.280]   and pushing harder.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.040]   But yeah, anything that allows people
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.440]   to be mobile and functional is great.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.860]   So what's your favorite example of endurance?
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:06.780]   And feel free to give us the extreme one
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.000]   and then we'll talk about averages
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.540]   to make sure we're thorough
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.880]   about averages versus exceptions.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.720]   - Right, we haven't done a lot in the field.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.660]   I mean, outdoors.
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:22.280]   Most of our endurance has been in a hot room
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.060]   with treadmill work and so forth.
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.380]   So the very first experiment we had,
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.300]   I think maybe 18 subjects just off the street.
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.100]   I mean, we just recruited people in the hallways,
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:33.480]   come on in and do this.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:37.700]   And what we found is we could, for this group,
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.900]   with one trial with and without cooling,
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:43.600]   we could double their endurance walking on the treadmill,
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.960]   walking uphill on the treadmill in the heat,
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.380]   like maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature,
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.540]   40 degrees centigrade.
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.960]   - So what does that experiment look like?
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.720]   You're having people walk on an incline,
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.080]   it's really warm.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.320]   Some people are just going to hit the quit button
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.720]   and say, "I've had enough," and get off the treadmill.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.520]   - Right. - With proper cooling,
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.960]   when are they doing the cooling?
[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.200]   - They're doing it continuously.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.540]   - I see. - Because in the laboratory,
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:10.460]   we can suspend devices from the ceiling, for example.
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:13.240]   Now we do have prototype wearable devices.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:18.240]   We did them in response to emails from Ebola workers
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.960]   a number of years ago in Sierra Leone.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.120]   They said, "We've read about your work with athletes.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.480]   Can't you do something for us?
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.600]   I mean, we're in the personal protective gear
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.940]   and we can't be in the hot zone
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.500]   for more than 15 or 20 minutes."
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.760]   So that started us on the challenge
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:39.160]   of developing wearable systems that could go under the PPE.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.780]   We've published that work now.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:41.620]   - That's great.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.560]   And I'm guessing the military special operators
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.440]   that are out in the desert and other locations
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.960]   are probably excited about this technology.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.280]   - Well, once they get it.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.620]   - Once they get it, it's coming, it's coming.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:55.380]   - Yeah, you know, I think some people might wonder,
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.760]   you know, if there are all these studies
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.180]   and there are these incredible results over the years,
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.660]   why haven't we heard more about it?
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.920]   And I will ask your opinion on that as well,
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.860]   but I'll just editorialize a little bit,
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:09.460]   is that the best laboratory work
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:11.060]   and its practical applications
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.860]   oftentimes requires many studies.
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:19.420]   And oftentimes there isn't a portal, so to speak,
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:22.140]   to get that information out into the technology sector.
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:25.740]   So there is a company that's developing this technology
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:30.260]   for people to use, to purchase and use.
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:31.420]   We might as well just tell us now,
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:32.980]   what is the name of that company?
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:34.820]   And do they have a website?
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:36.560]   People are going to want to know
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.140]   where can they get this magical technology?
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:42.000]   And is there a poor man's version of it as well?
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.220]   - Well, the company is Arturia, A-R-T-E-R-I-A.
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:51.220]   And the website is www.coolmit.com.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:56.940]   So coolmit is just C-O-O-L-M-I-T-T, coolmit.com.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:58.260]   - It's a great website.
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.120]   When I went there, it says that right now
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.660]   the technology is only available
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.020]   to professional sports teams and military.
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:04.860]   Is that true?
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.660]   - Well, where we stand now is the new version
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.620]   of the technology is sort of in beta test versions.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:12.520]   We got it into the hands of people
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:14.520]   who had used the technology before.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:17.960]   So there's NFL teams that are using,
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:22.040]   there's college teams, there's Olympics,
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:26.360]   there's the Navy Seals, Major League Baseball,
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.440]   the NBA, the National Tennis Association.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:33.860]   They have locations where now they are trying this out
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:35.560]   and reporting back, how's it working?
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.520]   How could you change it?
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.600]   How could you improve it?
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.860]   - Great. - And so forth.
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.620]   So that's where we are.
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:44.440]   But on the website, you can actually sign up
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.720]   for being one who will be able to get one
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:50.500]   when they are finally manufactured.
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.920]   They're now being made in fairly small lots
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.640]   because you want to change things
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.020]   as you realize how it can be improved.
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:58.420]   - Yeah, this is Stanford after all.
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.440]   You want to get the technology right.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.800]   I like to joke that one of the reasons
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.080]   I like being at Stanford so much
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:06.240]   is that not only are my colleagues amazing
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.640]   and they're so forward thinking,
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.280]   but they're all perfectionists.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.880]   And so the perfectionist mindset has to be perfect
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.920]   before it can go live, so to speak.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.400]   Well, I think there will be a lot of interest.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.680]   Let's talk about the technology
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.200]   in a little more detail for a moment.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.460]   And then let's talk about whether or not
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:26.480]   cruder forms of that technology exist
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.140]   either for sake of safety and/or performance.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:33.800]   So what is, the cool mitt, as I understand,
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.640]   is it's a mitt, it's a glove.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.360]   You put your hand into, you hold on to a surface
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.280]   and that surface cools your hand
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:46.120]   and thereby through this specialized portal,
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.800]   cools your core body temperature
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.040]   and all the muscles of the body.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:53.200]   Subjectively, if I were to do this right now,
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.240]   would I think that it was ice cold
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.260]   or would I think it was just cool?
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.520]   - Just cool. - I see.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.580]   - Ice cold is too cold.
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.660]   So people always ask, "Well, why can't you just
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.800]   "stick your hand in a bucket of ice water?"
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.120]   It's too cold.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.680]   What that does is that causes reflex vasoconstriction
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.840]   of the very portals that you're trying
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.580]   to maximize the heat loss from.
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:18.840]   So you stick your hand in cold water
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.280]   and when it comes out, it's cold.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.280]   - You just sealed up all the heat in your body.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.960]   - Yeah, right.
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:27.800]   So what I sort of recommended to someone at one point,
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.220]   they said, "Well, when I'm running,
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.840]   "can't I just carry a frozen juice can
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.360]   "and it will gradually melt?"
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.260]   And I said, "Well, no, because that's going to decrease
[00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:37.720]   "the heat loss from that hand."
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.040]   But if every couple minutes you switched hands,
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:41.880]   it might work.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.760]   - Well, I have a feeling that there are people
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.760]   now doing that as well as trying this.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:51.560]   So how long in the cool mitt at the proper temperature,
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:55.400]   how long are people putting their hands into the mitt?
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:59.320]   - We once again had just standardized on three minutes.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:03.560]   And part of the reason for that is that the rate of heat
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.600]   loss is an exponentially declining curve, okay?
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:11.600]   And three minutes sort of gets the best part of the curve.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.240]   So you can go longer and get more benefit,
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.840]   but the biggest bang for the buck
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.400]   is in the first two, three minutes.
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:22.160]   - Okay, you mentioned a number of impressive organizations,
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.520]   sports teams and military that are using this.
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.320]   This is not something that I typically see
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:29.440]   on the sidelines of games, although to be honest,
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.700]   I haven't looked very carefully.
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:35.080]   I'm guessing that they are probably keeping the technology
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.700]   somewhat under wraps.
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:38.600]   Where and how are they doing this?
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.180]   Are they running back to the locker room?
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.740]   I mean, the military special operators
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:44.360]   are doing their thing, but in terms of the athletes,
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.420]   is it possible, hypothetically,
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:51.020]   the athletes are doing this somewhat incognito?
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:53.860]   - It's possible, but I really don't know.
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:56.380]   People have mentioned here at Stanford,
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:59.000]   they don't see the football team using it.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   Well, the football team here at Stanford
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.740]   is mostly playing in cold weather, cool weather.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.560]   Night games are cool, even date games
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.400]   are not very hot frequently here,
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:13.600]   but when they go to a hot place like Arizona or Utah,
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:17.880]   at least our coach, Shaw, says that they take it with them
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.160]   and that's when they find the benefit,
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.220]   that's when they use it.
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:22.720]   - Interesting.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:27.720]   So is there a poor man or woman's version of this?
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.680]   You mentioned the juice can passing back and forth.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.280]   You mentioned cooling the hands.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.720]   A number of people said to me after learning a little bit
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:39.760]   about this science and technology,
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.240]   that they've experienced some big effects,
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.360]   positive effects of cooling by,
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.400]   and I confess I've done this,
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:50.380]   taking a package of frozen blueberries
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.240]   and just kind of passing it back and forth between my hands.
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:53.440]   Now, talking to you,
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.700]   I realize I probably didn't do it long enough.
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.840]   I probably was, I was only doing maybe 30 seconds,
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.640]   passing it back and forth between my hands
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.400]   and then going back into sets.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:06.320]   I did see a performance enhancing effect, absolutely,
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:10.900]   but I realized I probably wasn't optimizing the protocol.
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:14.540]   If you were going to give a crude protocol for,
[00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:15.720]   let's just say for the gym,
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.520]   because with running, it's a little bit tricky,
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.660]   but what would that look like
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:21.520]   if people wanted to just play with this
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.920]   in some sort of fashion?
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:28.780]   - Well, you know, it would be experimental.
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:31.360]   - Sure, yeah, none of that is very controlled.
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:34.520]   - Your idea of frozen peas is a good idea,
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:38.240]   and I think since there's been no actual study of that,
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:40.840]   you would have to be you working out
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.880]   what is the best for you.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:46.080]   But one way to figure it out is that if,
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:50.400]   after you hold the cold peas in one hand
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.360]   and you switch it to the other hand,
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.160]   if someone then comes and feels your hand,
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.880]   is it warm or cold?
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:59.960]   If it's cold, it means you've as a constricted.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:04.400]   If it's warm, it means the hot blood is still going there.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.340]   Okay, so we do that in the lab.
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:08.720]   - And the key is for it to not vasoconstrict.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.560]   - Right. - Okay.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.220]   So there's a test out there, folks.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.420]   If you're going to try this in kind of crude fashion,
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:17.320]   at least until the cool mitt is available more broadly
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:21.480]   to the general public, you could assess,
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.940]   you want to assess whether or not your palms
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:27.680]   actually feel cool to the touch by somebody else.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:30.080]   And if it does, that means you've essentially shut down
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.640]   the porter, you're sealing in more heat, which is bad.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:36.160]   What about putting this cold pack
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.320]   of some sort on the face or-
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.420]   - Or the feet. - More of the feet.
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.120]   I work out at home, I don't often work out barefooted,
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.440]   but I suppose I could, like they did in the '70s,
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.360]   you know, when those guys were walking around
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.360]   without shoes and squatting without any shoes or socks on.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.720]   Could I put my feet on them?
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.640]   - You could.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.040]   If you had simply had a water-perfused pad
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.700]   and you were circulating cool water through it,
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.180]   you could just put your feet on it, okay?
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:11.760]   Part of the problem is that you don't want,
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.640]   let's say you have just a cold pack of something.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.680]   The problem is back to boundary layers again.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.160]   If you don't have a convective stream of the cooling medium,
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:27.040]   the heat sink is not as effective because there'll be
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:30.880]   a boundary layer developed between the heat sink material
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.320]   and your skin, so that decreases its efficacy.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.160]   - I see.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.160]   Maybe we should just for a moment talk about convection,
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.360]   radiation and convection, and just make that clear.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.680]   Like if I put my hands, let's say it's a cold night
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.660]   and I'm at a campfire and I take my hands
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.000]   and I put them out to the fire.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.160]   - You're getting radiation.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.400]   - You're getting radiation.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.860]   - Right, right. - Okay.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:55.060]   - And then if it's a windy, warm night,
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.560]   no, I don't know if that's the best example.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.940]   Give us a good example of convection.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.300]   - Convection, sure, is in a cool breeze.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.060]   You know, with the wind chill factor,
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:05.320]   that's due to convection, okay?
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:10.180]   But in terms of heat transfer between two objects,
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:13.180]   if you have convection of the medium,
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:17.780]   whether it's blood on the inside and water on the outside,
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:22.280]   you increase the heat exchange if you have convection
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.120]   on both sides.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.540]   - Right, so this is why just planting my feet
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:29.000]   on two packages of, my bare feet on two packages
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.160]   of frozen peas, there's really no opportunity
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.840]   for circulation and therefore heat transfer.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.120]   So it's not really optimal, which is, and I-
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.440]   - But once again, it depends on the surface area
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.020]   to get any benefit at all.
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:45.240]   We have a study that we published
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.200]   which was investigating the standard treatment
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.400]   for hyperthermia in the field.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:55.920]   And the standard treatment that's recommended
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.080]   by medical organizations is you take cold packs
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.180]   and you put them in the axilla, the groin.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.240]   - The axilla or the armpits?
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.100]   - The armpits, yeah, the groin, which is-
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.600]   - Thin skin, lots of vasculature.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.440]   - Right, and the neck.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.720]   So what we did is we did studies
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.700]   in which we made people hyperthermic
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:21.800]   and then we measured the rate at which we could cool them
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:27.520]   by putting those positions in those heat exchange bags
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:30.760]   in the recommended location versus on the glabrous skin,
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.560]   versus palms, soles, and face.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.480]   The cooling rate was double.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.320]   - Wow.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.720]   - So we put the same ice packs, the same cold packs
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:46.400]   on the heat portals rather than the axilla,
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.880]   the groin and the face.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.720]   - Wow.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.840]   - Or the neck.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.280]   - Wow, so face, hands, and bottoms of feet
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.120]   will cool you twice as fast
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.940]   as putting cold packs into your armpits,
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.940]   your groin, or back of neck.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:03.640]   - So I like to give the analogy
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.160]   of if your car is overheating, okay,
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:09.040]   and you have a hose, a garden hose,
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.060]   where should you spray your cooling system?
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.960]   Should you spray the radiator
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:15.640]   or should you spray the tubes
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.680]   going in and out of the radiator?
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:20.200]   Well, the rationale with putting these cold packs
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.120]   in the axilla, the groin, and the neck
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.400]   is that you're getting close to the major arteries.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.360]   Sure, that's going to be effective,
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.880]   but it's much more effective
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.000]   if you actually increase the heat loss capacity
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.440]   of the radiating surface, the radiators.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:38.660]   - So you cool the hot stuff heading toward the core.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:43.660]   That's essentially what the standard operating procedure is,
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:46.560]   that you hit the arteries.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.400]   - Amazing.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.920]   - And the veins, the arteries and veins.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.420]   - I'm going to just tell a brief story
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:55.420]   that illustrates how almost everybody gets this stuff wrong,
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.560]   and then I'm going to use that as an opportunity
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.260]   to ask you about heating, deliberate heating,
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:02.080]   as opposed to deliberate cooling.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.840]   So about four months ago, a friend of mine, incidentally,
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.800]   a guy who did nine years on the SEAL team
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.840]   is really skilled cold water swimmer.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.160]   We went out for a swim in the morning.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:17.400]   I'm not nearly even close to being in the same universe
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.740]   of his output potential.
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:21.820]   We do these swims, I'm familiar with them.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.500]   I got enough blubber on me that I stay warm enough
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.080]   in the cold Pacific, no wetsuits.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.960]   We do the morning cold swim for about a mile or so,
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.900]   and we brought with us a young kid that I know real well
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.380]   that hangs out with us sometimes and trains with us,
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:37.720]   who's got very little body fat.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.980]   He's just exceptionally lean,
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:42.480]   despite eating everything inside, right?
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.480]   Teenager, great athlete, great kid, great swimmer.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.680]   So we're out there swimming, and at some point,
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.080]   we're talking to him and it's clear
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.000]   that he's gone hypothermic.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.960]   He's slurring his words, he's not doing well.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.800]   So we get him onto the beach, his teeth are turning yellow,
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:03.240]   he's quaking, he's not, he's got, you know,
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:06.200]   his saliva is taking on that consistency that's clear,
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.900]   like he's hypothermic.
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:10.140]   We go to the lifeguard station.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.420]   Lifeguard says, "Okay, let's get his vitals,
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:13.260]   "let's do all this."
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:17.340]   Meanwhile, trying stand next to him, you know,
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.660]   and heat him up by heating up his torso.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:23.980]   So there we are, like pressing against this guy, our friend,
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:24.940]   trying to heat him up.
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.000]   They get a blanket on him.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.900]   He's, I'm realizing he was barefoot, his face was exposed,
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:32.740]   although we did cover his head with the blanket,
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.720]   and he eventually came back.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.680]   We got some warm liquids into him and he was okay,
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.700]   he was fine.
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.640]   I don't know that his mother is ever going to let him swim
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.220]   with us again.
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:43.760]   If I ever disappear and go missing,
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.500]   it's because of that incident.
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.540]   Anyway, he did great, he recovered,
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.740]   he's back in the water and doing well.
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:55.940]   But I realized that pretty much everything from the point
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:59.860]   where we got back on the beach until he was back to normal
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.380]   was we did incorrectly.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:06.380]   We heated his torso, we left his extremities exposed,
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:09.180]   and we assumed we were doing the right thing.
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.060]   And the lifeguard is a skilled lifeguard
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.260]   at a major public beach.
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:15.460]   So I guess the simple question is,
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.940]   did we get everything wrong?
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:18.820]   Did we get anything right?
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:21.040]   And what would have been the better option
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.920]   to heat up a hypothermic person in that
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.780]   or a similar situation?
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:28.400]   - Well, it's interesting you asked that
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:33.040]   because that is the way we got into this area
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.340]   of investigation.
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:39.180]   I worked on how the hypothalamus regulates body temperature
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.920]   neurophysiology.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:45.640]   And one day we were having a discussion with a colleague
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.020]   in the Department of Anesthesia.
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:51.640]   And he jokingly said to my colleague, he said,
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:54.560]   "Yeah, you guys think you know so much about temperature.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.700]   I bet you couldn't solve a problem we have
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.640]   in the recovery room."
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.860]   What's that?
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.660]   Well, the patients come out of surgery,
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.880]   they're hypothermic and it takes us hours
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.340]   to get them to stop shivering.
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.020]   What do they do in the recovery room?
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:09.780]   Exactly what you suggested.
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:13.820]   They put in warm blankets, they put on heat lamps,
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.880]   and it takes them an hour or two hours
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.940]   to get these patients to stop shivering
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:20.580]   to bring them back up.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.740]   So we say, ah, it's a trivial problem.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.920]   No, it's a hard problem.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:28.380]   It's a hard problem because when you're under anesthesia,
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:29.840]   you're vasodilated.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.600]   When you come out of anesthesia, you're hypothermic
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.420]   and you vasoconstrict.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:38.200]   That makes it very difficult to get heat into the body.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.400]   So we got the idea that, well,
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.800]   if we could just take one appendage, like an arm,
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:47.940]   and we put it in a environment wrapped in a heating pad
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:51.260]   and a negative pressure, you know, suction,
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.660]   that would pull more blood into that limb,
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.020]   that blood would get heated,
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:57.360]   and it would warm the body up faster.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:02.000]   So my colleague built a prototype device.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.860]   You couldn't get such a device into the hospital these days.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:09.620]   But we were with our anesthesiologist friend.
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:11.720]   We took it into the recovery room,
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.380]   and first thing the patient said, "No way.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:17.620]   "You're not gonna put that on my patient."
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:22.620]   But he prevailed, and first patient didn't shiver at all.
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:25.340]   First patient was back to normal temperature,
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:28.300]   core temperature, in I think it was eight minutes,
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.260]   eight or nine minutes.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:31.540]   - Is this now standard practice in hospitals?
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:32.380]   - No, no, no.
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:36.240]   - So this is another example where I don't get upset about,
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.960]   although it's upsetting to know that it's not,
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.460]   but I think that it's yet another case
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.780]   where a fundamental problem exists.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:49.780]   There's a science-based solution
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:52.300]   that makes sense at the level of physiology,
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:55.900]   engineering, and practice, and yet it's not being done.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:56.820]   - Right.
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.060]   - And I mean, that's a whole other discussion
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.680]   as to what the limitations are.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.300]   Well, perhaps, I know a number of our listeners
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.220]   are in the healthcare and medical profession
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.380]   as well as military athletes,
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.820]   and just also standard other types of jobs,
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.400]   civilians doing other types of work.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.020]   It would be wonderful if people understood this.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:19.020]   So once again, is there a homegrown technology
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.020]   that people could use?
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:24.100]   If somebody is hypothermic, what is going to be the best way
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:24.940]   for them to warm up?
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:28.000]   Is it going to be holding a nice warm mug of cocoa
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.780]   or something like that, but not too hot, I guess,
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.360]   is again the idea? - Yeah, sure, yeah.
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.860]   Well, actually, you can go hotter on the glabrous skin.
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:39.180]   - Oh, because it'll dilate.
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:42.500]   - Because it takes the heat away faster, okay?
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.260]   But back to the anesthesia,
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:47.700]   what you can do is you can use warm pads.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.800]   They have them in all hospitals.
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.780]   They have circulating water-perfused pads.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:54.660]   - Hot water bottle type stuff. - Put them on the feet.
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:55.500]   Put them on the feet. - So typically,
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.320]   they'll slide them under your lower back
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.180]   or something like that. - Yeah, put them on the feet.
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.620]   Okay, sure, that will do it.
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:07.360]   But it turns out that we discovered through this work
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.600]   that it had nothing to do with the whole arm.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.400]   It was only the hand.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.540]   And that's when we came to the realization
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.400]   of these special blood vessels.
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.160]   We didn't discover the blood vessels.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.180]   They're described in Grey's Anatomy,
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.120]   but nobody knew what they were for.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:24.880]   - And you mentioned bears earlier and other hairy animals.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.360]   Do they have these AVAs as well?
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.000]   And I suppose we haven't defined AVAs.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.880]   We've been pretty good about the no acronyms rule.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.840]   AVAs is?
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.900]   - Arteria venous anastomoses.
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:40.440]   So a connection between the arteries and the veins, yeah.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.820]   - I actually use this technology.
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:43.480]   I have a bulldog, bulldog mastiff.
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.840]   He has a very high propensity for overheating
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.720]   'cause they're terrible at dumping heat
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:53.040]   and bulldogs are great at pushing themselves
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.120]   to the point of exhaustion or death, it happens.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.540]   And so now we do what we call palmer cooling.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:00.960]   Sorry, I couldn't help myself.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.880]   Where I'll take Costello and lower him
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:06.800]   into a cool body of water, just the bottoms of his paws.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.760]   Although I think animals instinctually know to do this
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.680]   and will go and stand in bodies of water.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.120]   They don't often lie down all the way, some do.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.020]   But they seem to know that's a great way
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:21.160]   to cool themselves off.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.680]   - Yeah, oh, absolutely, yeah.
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.880]   - And they get the advantage that their palms
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.520]   and their feet are essentially the same thing.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.960]   - So we actually built devices for dogs.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:30.800]   - Did you really?
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.160]   - And tried them on, I did a rod sled dogs
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.780]   and it worked beautifully.
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:38.120]   They had little backpacks with the equipment
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.560]   and pads on all their feet and it worked beautifully.
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.920]   - Amazing, amazing.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.200]   Along the lines of heating, deliberate heating,
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:51.840]   wearing a knit cap is something that,
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.860]   you see more of that on the East Coast.
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:58.160]   People run around Boston and New England with a knit cap.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:00.240]   I've always done that at the start of my runs
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.880]   to try and warm up more quickly and then I take it off.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.560]   I shed layers as I go.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:09.160]   Is that a rational practice the way I just described it?
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.960]   Yeah, because warming up is important too.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.800]   There's a certain amount of quote unquote warming up
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.040]   that's required to lubricate joints
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.380]   or at least to get the sense that joints are lubricated
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:21.520]   and to be able to move more easily.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.400]   Do you still recommend that people warm up?
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.800]   - Yeah, but I think we're misled by the term warm up
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.120]   as if the major purpose is to raise temperature.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.960]   I'm not aware of any data on this,
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.600]   but I do think that the major contribution
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.700]   is increasing flexibility.
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:45.480]   So you're going to avoid having damage of joints
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:48.240]   and tendons and ligaments and so forth.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:55.140]   But also the ability of the mitochondria to produce energy
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:14:00.400]   can be impaired at lower temperatures.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.960]   And you have to keep in mind
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.960]   that we say our body temperature is 37 degrees,
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.540]   but that's not true.
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:08.240]   - Yeah, it varies across the day.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.880]   - Well, it varies in parts of your body.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:14.500]   I mean, my hands and arms are not at 37 degrees right now.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.500]   They're much lower.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:18.440]   - So that raises an interesting question.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:22.480]   What is the best way to measure core body temperature?
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.620]   - Well, the best core temperature is that,
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:28.020]   what we use is esophageal.
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:30.820]   So we put a thermocouple up the nose
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:32.860]   about two feet down the esophagus
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:34.840]   so that it's about the level of your heart.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.860]   - Not gym or home practical, although I don't know.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.240]   Some of those COVID swab tests go pretty far.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.120]   - I can't even imagine it going any further.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.220]   I felt like my brain was getting tickled.
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:46.840]   And it was really unpleasant.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.220]   - Timpaniq is a pretty good-
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.060]   - So the ear.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:51.560]   - The ear, it's not foolproof
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.840]   because you have to actually have it aimed properly
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.160]   at the tympanum.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.760]   And frequently what you're getting
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.920]   is you're getting sort of a mixture of tympanic
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.320]   plus ear canal temperature.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.560]   - And for those listening and for those watching,
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.920]   the tympanic is not going to be the pinna
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.760]   that this part of the ear, the outer part of the ear,
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.420]   the tympanic is going to be near the tympanic,
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:11.840]   headed towards the tympanic membrane.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.680]   And yes, I'm sticking my finger in my ear
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:17.160]   because that's where the laser would actually have to go
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.680]   to measure your temperature.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.200]   So when we were walking into restaurants
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.280]   and other places nowadays
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.960]   and they're shining the laser at our forehead,
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.040]   that's probably giving a pretty crude readout
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:25.880]   of temperature.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.440]   - It is, but there's much less insulation
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.000]   between your brain and your forehead skin
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.480]   than there is between your biceps and your arm skin.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.900]   So if you're going to measure a surface temperature,
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.040]   that's where you would do it.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:42.440]   And we do temperatures in the infrared.
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:46.860]   We take infrared videos of athletes and our subjects.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:49.540]   And of course the face lights up.
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:51.300]   - Okay, so if we're not,
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.400]   I imagine there's going to be a technology coming soon
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.140]   where you can point your smartwatch
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.200]   or your smartphone at yourself
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.700]   and you're going to get a heat map.
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:15:59.540]   - Right, right.
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:00.360]   - That's got it.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.480]   If somebody out there hasn't already invented this
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.800]   for the typical folks outside military,
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.080]   somebody please invent that
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:10.180]   because I think there's growing interest in temperature
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.600]   based on the work that you're doing
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.440]   and also for sake of something I do want to touch on,
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.500]   which is sleep and metabolism.
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:19.400]   Although we don't want to open up those portals all the way
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.540]   because we'd need several days to cover it.
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:25.320]   Okay, so putting on the cap,
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.940]   what about some of the helmets and gloves
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.640]   that are used in typical sports?
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:32.240]   Do you think that those can be improved
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.420]   in order to improve performance
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:36.180]   in terms of their ventilation ability
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:40.100]   or keeping Palmer surfaces open, for instance?
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.760]   - Well, you mentioned about the knit cap
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.520]   in cold weather especially,
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.260]   and that is significant
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:50.220]   because you do lose a lot of heat from your head,
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:53.260]   but it's a constant heat loss.
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:56.540]   It's not variable like your glibrous skin.
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:59.740]   So if you decrease that heat loss,
[01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.720]   you're going to be warmer.
[01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:06.420]   So sure, that has an impact.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:10.540]   Now, in terms of helmets, they should be ventilated.
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:13.580]   I mean, they should have enough space in them
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:17.180]   and holes in them so that air can circulate.
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:22.180]   You don't want to thermally insulate your scalp.
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:25.420]   That's going to decrease heat loss quite considerably.
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:27.180]   Just for a resting individual,
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:30.200]   the brain is about 20% of your metabolism.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.180]   So that's a lot of heat production.
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.220]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:38.520]   I realized there was a question that I failed to ask earlier
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:41.740]   that is burning in my mind now,
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:43.740]   and I think is likely burning in the minds
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.740]   of some of the listeners, which is,
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:49.860]   so if you do this cooling in between sets in the gym,
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:52.660]   you get this performance enhancing effect.
[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:55.060]   You don't get the delayed onset muscle soreness,
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:56.540]   which is great.
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:59.080]   So presumably, the body is adapting.
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.780]   You're getting better as a consequence
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:03.180]   of being able to do more work per unit time
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:06.140]   or to go harder in some way, of course.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.040]   You get that adaptation.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.620]   Does that mean that you see a performance enhancing effect
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:14.820]   even when you don't cool
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:17.320]   if you've previously done the cooling workouts?
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.740]   So for instance, let's say I can do 10 sets of 10 dips,
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:21.660]   which I like to think I can.
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:22.540]   Maybe I need to go try.
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:24.020]   I don't know if I've done that recently.
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:24.940]   I do the cooling.
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:27.380]   I cool for three minutes between sets.
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:32.220]   And let's say I get to the point where I can do 20
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:35.700]   for 10 sets, 10 sets of 20 repetitions,
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.360]   and then I don't cool.
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.780]   Will I be able to match or approximate
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.620]   my new better performance?
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:44.220]   - You keep your gains.
[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.260]   It's a true conditioning effect.
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:49.820]   You respond to the increased work volume
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:52.460]   by all of those mechanisms you mentioned.
[01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:53.300]   - Amazing.
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:55.140]   - You increase the number of contractile elements
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:57.620]   in your muscles, muscles get bigger.
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:58.460]   - Amazing.
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.300]   - We had an experiment that involved
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:05.300]   some of our female students, not athletes,
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:08.300]   but just regular, they were freshmen actually.
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:12.460]   And the experiment was 10 sets of pushups
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:15.220]   to muscle failure with or without cooling.
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.300]   - Same regimen, three minutes of cooling
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.580]   in between sets of pushups.
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:19.580]   - Right.
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:24.580]   Some of those young ladies reached over 800 pushups
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.860]   - Now the total duration of the workout
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:28.620]   could be getting much longer as a consequence
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:29.620]   of doing more work.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.300]   - No, it doesn't take you longer.
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:34.580]   Well, minor, I mean, a pushup is pretty fast.
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.500]   - Yeah, it's pretty fast.
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:40.080]   - So you do 10 sets, the maximum 45 minutes total.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.880]   - That's a lot of pushups.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.620]   - That's a lot of pushups.
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:45.660]   So the interesting thing is they came in one day
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:48.820]   and they said, "Dr. Heller, you cost us a lot of money."
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:49.660]   Why?
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:51.220]   Well, we had a formal dance this weekend.
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.340]   We all had to buy new sleeveless dresses.
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.260]   - Nice, it's a good problem to have.
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:57.360]   Good problem to have.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.840]   Let's talk about steroids, anabolic steroids.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.060]   We're heading into an Olympics.
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.220]   Every time the Olympics rolls around,
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:10.100]   you hear about these cases of people getting popped
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:12.980]   as they call it, or caught for anabolic steroids.
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.700]   There are some accusations out there now
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:19.700]   there'll be more, this will get handled in the press
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:21.980]   and then the various organizations.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:26.140]   Clearly athletes and non-athletes use anabolic steroids.
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.820]   And typically anabolic steroids
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:30.220]   are of the testosterone variety.
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:32.740]   There are derivatives, et cetera.
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:34.980]   And those derivatives do different things
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:36.940]   in the anabolic versus androgenic, et cetera.
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:41.460]   But typically the idea is, at least as I understand it,
[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.460]   in talking to some of these individuals,
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:47.540]   is that they allow people to train more
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.700]   because they recover faster.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:53.120]   They are able to synthesize more protein
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.680]   because they're basically getting a second puberty.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.340]   Because as we all know, during puberty,
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:59.140]   there's a lot of growth of the body.
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:02.680]   And of course there are a lot of negative effects
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.060]   of abuse of these things.
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:07.820]   And they are banned from various sports organizations.
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:10.140]   Especially I should mention in combat sports,
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:13.760]   it's especially concerning because in combat sports,
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:16.780]   a performance enhancement means that you can harm somebody
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:20.020]   more than you would be able to otherwise,
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:21.940]   as opposed to in other sorts of sports,
[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:23.600]   just to conceptualize it.
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.860]   And I'm not taking a moral stance on any of this.
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:28.060]   I just want to ask you,
[01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:32.960]   when you compare Palmer cooling to anabolic steroids,
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:37.960]   in terms of gym performance, what do you see?
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:41.640]   - Well, we do not do research on steroids,
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:46.780]   but there is a lot of research in the literature.
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:51.180]   A lot of that research in the strength conditioning
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:55.300]   magazines is not very scientific.
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:56.420]   - No. - Okay?
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:58.300]   - Or it might not even be scientific at all.
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:21:59.140]   - Right. - Right.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:02.780]   - But we did do an analysis of reputable papers.
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:06.940]   And we did find, I think it was probably eight or nine,
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:10.700]   10 studies on bench press,
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:15.180]   increase in bench press performance on steroids or not.
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:16.160]   Okay?
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.980]   The bottom-- - These were males or females?
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:20.620]   - Well, these were all males,
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:22.220]   but I'll get back to the females.
[01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:23.500]   Okay.
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:28.400]   The bottom line is that in all of these independent studies,
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:33.400]   their rate of improvement was approximately 1% per week.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.340]   - Okay. - Okay.
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:38.340]   Now I've just told you about studies
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:42.680]   in which we've had 300% increase in a month.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:46.940]   So. [laughs]
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:49.540]   - It's an enormous, enormous difference.
[01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:51.940]   - So why would you endanger your health
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:55.380]   as well as your legal ability to compete
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.280]   with such an ineffective tool?
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.120]   - Yeah.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:03.460]   No, I think the notion of performance enhancement
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:04.900]   is a really interesting one
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:07.860]   because people clearly pay attention to nutrition.
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:10.820]   Sleep is now something that I think everybody,
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.860]   but especially athletes are paying attention to.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:14.220]   - Right.
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.660]   - And I predict that temperature
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:21.460]   will be one of the more powerful parameters
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:23.180]   that people are going to be focusing on.
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:24.220]   - Yeah, that's true.
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.820]   - Because of the magnitude of the effects
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:27.180]   that you're describing.
[01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:30.980]   And also because so much of the variability
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:32.460]   around performance, as you mentioned,
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:35.820]   has to do with when you go to a new environment.
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:39.380]   Everyone has their home environment worked out pretty well.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:40.860]   Sleep well in your own bed at home.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:42.620]   When you can control everything,
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:43.820]   your performance is always great.
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.740]   This is why I think military special operators
[01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:48.020]   are a particularly interesting group
[01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:51.020]   because their whole world is centered
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:54.060]   around elite and high performance
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:56.180]   with very high risk, high consequence
[01:23:56.180 --> 01:23:58.220]   under variable conditions.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.400]   The essence of their work
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.900]   is variable, unpredictable conditions.
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:05.260]   So you mentioned female athletes and steroids.
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:06.580]   I'm curious about this.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.720]   - Yeah, because everybody has always said to us,
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:11.300]   "Well, you only use male subjects."
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:14.460]   And obviously they have this testosterone background.
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:16.300]   They have higher levels of testosterone.
[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.200]   That's why you get these results.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.780]   So we did a comparative study on females.
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:22.780]   We get the same results.
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.620]   - Impressive.
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.900]   And these are our Stanford athletes or also-
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:27.260]   - No, these were not Stanford athletes.
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:31.100]   They were Stanford students, but not athletes.
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:34.020]   Well, we have done, of course, work on some athletes,
[01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:37.420]   but in general, we don't do research on our teams,
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:40.580]   our varsity teams, so they have their own protocols.
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:42.460]   They have their own training programs.
[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:44.500]   - Yeah, they don't like us to get too close to them.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.660]   No, I work with some of these folks and the coaches
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:49.860]   and they're very skeptical with good reason also.
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:54.300]   And the reason I ask is that when you see these Pac-10
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:56.320]   or division one college athletes
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.100]   and then you see their peers,
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:01.280]   there's clearly a difference, right?
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:05.000]   I mean, they are pedigreed throughout, right?
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.340]   And more typical folks also have different goals.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:13.180]   They may not want to get infinitely stronger
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.840]   or perform more endurance work.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.200]   So I want to ask you a couple of things
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.900]   about shivering and metabolism,
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:22.980]   because I think they're very interesting
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:25.180]   and sufficiently related.
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:29.940]   So my understanding is that shiver is an adaptation
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:31.580]   that's designed to heat us up.
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:32.700]   - Yes.
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:35.980]   - That we have brown fat
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:37.660]   that's in compartments around our body
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:41.900]   that are activated by shiver or coactivated by shiver,
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:46.600]   and that shivering is useful for increasing metabolism.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.100]   Is that true?
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:50.760]   And does it require that cold be the stimulus?
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.260]   So two scenarios, I'll give you an experiment.
[01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:56.060]   I put someone into cold water of some sort,
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:58.540]   and then I make them get out or I have them stand near it,
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.840]   and then they start shivering.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:03.740]   My understanding is that their metabolism will increase.
[01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:06.900]   What if I take someone and I just have them shiver,
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:08.140]   but they're not exposed by cold?
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:09.940]   It's kind of a deliberate shivering.
[01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:14.740]   Will that also create a substantial increase in metabolism?
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:15.620]   - Sure.
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:19.180]   So deliberate shivering without cold
[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:21.660]   is essentially what happens when you get a fever.
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:25.400]   Your set point goes up and you're hypothalamus,
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.760]   and you actually, even though you're normal body temperature,
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.060]   your thermostat is telling you you're too cold.
[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:34.540]   Increase your metabolism, so shiver, right?
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:39.140]   So sure, shivering is a good way of increasing metabolism,
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:41.060]   but it only can take metabolism up
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:43.700]   maybe three or four times resting.
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:44.540]   - Okay.
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:48.140]   - Whereas exercise can take you up 10 times.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:48.980]   - Got it.
[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:49.800]   All right, I'm going to ask a couple
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.700]   of more random questions, and seemingly random.
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:55.380]   Do bears actually hibernate?
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:56.300]   - Oh yeah.
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.180]   - The true hibernation?
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.540]   - Well, it depends on how you define true.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:04.700]   A bear, actually, we've done a lot of work on bears.
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:08.260]   - Do you also put the nose thermocouple
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:09.380]   down in the esophagus?
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:10.980]   - Oh, we implant them surgically.
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:12.800]   - Okay, they're anesthetized when you implant them.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:13.640]   - Yes.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:14.460]   - What kind of bears are these?
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:15.300]   - Black bears.
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:16.140]   - Okay.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.220]   - And did this with colleagues at University of Alaska,
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:19.920]   and we're analyzing the data now.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:24.460]   But what we've done is we've had now a total of 18 bears,
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:29.280]   and we implant them with EEG, EKG temperature sensors.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.840]   And sometimes we actually measure their oxygen consumption.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:32.900]   - These are bears in the wild.
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:34.100]   - These are bears in the wild,
[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:36.820]   but they're brought in to University of Alaska,
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:38.940]   where we keep them in an outdoor enclosure.
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:42.580]   So they're hibernating in an S-box, in an enclosure.
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:45.340]   And we're recording this electrophysiological data
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:47.220]   continuously for six months.
[01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.060]   - Amazing.
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:49.580]   How do I get on this protocol?
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:53.540]   Craig and I are doing some work together going forward,
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:56.260]   and maybe you can slide me onto this protocol too.
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:57.300]   That sounds amazing.
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:00.660]   Right now, it's a matter of just analyzing the gigabytes,
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:03.840]   terabytes of data that have been collected.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.880]   But anyway, you asked about hibernation.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:10.880]   So bears only go down to about 33, 34 degrees centigrade
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.680]   in the core temperature.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:16.400]   And that's been argued that, well, they can't go lower
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.240]   because they have so much insulation.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:21.060]   They're so big, their surface volume ratio and so forth.
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:22.600]   And that's not true.
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.640]   They shiver.
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:27.320]   So if we have a day like minus 40,
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:30.480]   which you get up in Alaska,
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.760]   they will go through periods of shivering
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:35.920]   and maintain a core temperature on 33, 34.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.660]   Now the ground squirrels and the marmots,
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:41.120]   which are smaller animals,
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:44.400]   they will drop down to a body temperature,
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:47.620]   maybe within a degree of the environment.
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:50.600]   So they can go down to one or two degrees centigrade,
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:54.320]   just above freezing during bouts of hibernation.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.720]   So they'll stay in hibernation for seven or eight days
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.680]   and they'll come back up to normal body temperature
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.520]   for a day, then they'll go back down and do another-
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:01.360]   - What do they do during that day
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:02.720]   when they're warming up again?
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:03.560]   Do they go around?
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:07.200]   - They rearrange their nests, eat, if they've stored food.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.120]   Some species store lots of food,
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.880]   others just depend on their fat.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:14.760]   - A former mentor of mine, my master's degree mentor,
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.820]   and a colleague and friend of yours,
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:21.340]   Irving Zucker at UC Berkeley, told me a story once,
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:24.020]   told me a lot of stories, tells great stories, as you know.
[01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:27.260]   He told me that when an animal comes out of hibernation,
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:31.460]   periodically, that it's a very dramatic thing to observe.
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:34.340]   That it's not like they wake up and yawn and look around,
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:37.660]   but it's like a complete epileptic seizure.
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:38.820]   - Right.
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:40.200]   - What's going on there? - Shivering.
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.020]   - It's just a very dramatic shiver.
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:45.620]   - So at the low temperatures, they cannot shiver
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:48.660]   because the effect of temperature on the conduction
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:50.860]   of the nerves and the muscle factors-
[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:52.100]   - So they're shut down, basically.
[01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:52.940]   - They're shut down.
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:54.300]   So there, they use brown fat.
[01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:56.760]   So activate brown fat, and then when they get up
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:59.820]   to a temperature of maybe 15, 16 degrees centigrade,
[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:02.620]   then the shivering starts and it gets very, very violent,
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:05.340]   but they're still asleep.
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:08.100]   - Do we shiver in our sleep?
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:12.380]   - I would imagine we do, but it probably wakes us up.
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:13.220]   - Interesting.
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:16.140]   So the brown fat is kind of like kindling.
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:21.140]   - The brown fat is a tissue which has lots of stored energy,
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:26.900]   'cause it's fat, but unlike our white fat, our regular fat,
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:30.980]   it also has lots of these little powerhouses, mitochondria,
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:32.740]   and lots of blood supply.
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:36.880]   So essentially, it is a tissue just to produce heat.
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.260]   That's what it's there for.
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:41.700]   Now, in these hibernators, there are big patches
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.180]   of brown fat at certain locations that are critical,
[01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:46.800]   like around the heart, for example.
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:49.780]   For us, the brown fat is sort of distributed.
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:51.740]   So for many, many years,
[01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:54.100]   it was thought humans don't have brown fat,
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:55.560]   but indeed we do.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:59.020]   It's just not localized into discrete fat pads
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:02.980]   like it is in ground squirrels, marmots.
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:04.860]   - I don't know why the phrase fat pads
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:08.460]   is so satisfying to say, but it is fat pads.
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:12.760]   Speaking of fat pads, I was taught that we have,
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:15.020]   by the internet, I should say,
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:18.100]   I was taught by the internet that we have brown fat
[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:20.240]   between our scapulae and our upper neck.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:24.420]   Is that truly a source of brown enrichment for brown fat?
[01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:26.500]   - If you're a ground squirrel.
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:29.040]   - So it's complete, this is all the drawings out there.
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:32.180]   Okay, so what I'm hearing you say is that brown fat
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:33.700]   is actually distributed in patches.
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:38.420]   - In humans, it's distributed along with other fat tissue.
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:41.060]   It's not as discrete.
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:44.640]   - So the reason I'm kind of shocked and amused
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:49.380]   and troubled by this is because there is
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:53.960]   a somewhat standard protocol in the performance,
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:56.760]   wellness, whatever, world, whatever you want to call it,
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:59.860]   of putting ice packs on the upper back
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:04.460]   as a way to stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.
[01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:09.060]   I'm hearing some inhales of concern from the physiologist.
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:12.100]   So tell me why, it sounds like that's probably not
[01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:14.880]   the best way to stimulate brown fat activation.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:17.140]   - Well, let's put it this way.
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:18.760]   - You're not attacking anyone specifically
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.460]   because the whole world believes this.
[01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:21.420]   So it doesn't-
[01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:26.140]   - But it may not be totally facetious or false.
[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.540]   Think of what that's doing.
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:31.100]   If you put ice right there where your spinal cord
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:32.800]   is close to the surface,
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:35.400]   that's where you're going to hit the vertebral arteries.
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.060]   So you're essentially putting a cold source
[01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:40.340]   into the brain, to the hypothalamus.
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:43.340]   The hypothalamus says you're too cold,
[01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:47.180]   so it is going to turn on shivering and brown fat.
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:50.660]   - Would there be a better site
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:54.060]   for sake of activating brown fat?
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:58.040]   Polymer cooling?
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:01.620]   - You know, I can't say,
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:03.700]   because the activation of brown fat
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:07.620]   is a sympathetic nervous system response.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:10.700]   So any lowering of core temperature
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:15.220]   that will let the thermostat say you're too cold
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:16.960]   is going to turn on sympathetic.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:21.960]   Now, people will have perhaps different amounts of brown fat.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:25.740]   So newborn have more brown fat than adults.
[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:27.700]   - 'Cause newborns can't shiver, correct?
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:28.540]   - I don't know.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.860]   - Okay, that's what I read.
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:31.180]   I don't know if it's true.
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:34.700]   I read that in what I believe to be credible sources.
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:37.180]   - Yeah, it could be, I just don't know.
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:40.140]   It depends on if it's really newborn.
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:42.300]   I can agree because you don't have
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:46.320]   all of the motor pathways connected up yet.
[01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.820]   That's something that occurs in early days of life
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:52.320]   and is probably one of the functions of REM sleep,
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:57.160]   which infants have a lot of, okay?
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:59.560]   But how to activate brown fat?
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.880]   If you are consistently exposed to cold,
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:05.380]   so if you live in the Arctic
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:08.080]   and you go out jogging in the winter,
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:11.040]   maybe that will increase the amount of brown fat you have.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:13.920]   If you live in the tropics, maybe you have less brown fat.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:14.760]   I don't know.
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:17.720]   I don't know of any studies which have looked into that.
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:20.420]   - Okay, ice headache.
[01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:22.040]   Sometimes I'll drink a cold beverage
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:25.900]   after all, eat ice cream and my head will-
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:27.700]   - Brain freeze. - Slitting, brain freeze.
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:30.740]   And speaking of special forces, I was talking to,
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:35.560]   we all see the images, the SEAL training/screening
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.680]   in Coronado where they're going in and out of the Pacific,
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.920]   which is very cold.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.800]   But I know they also spend some time
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:44.720]   in the very cold waters of Kodiak, Alaska.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.680]   You mentioned Alaska.
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:49.240]   Brain freeze, so-called ice headache,
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:54.240]   is a common occurrence there in those situations.
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.220]   But we all have experienced this.
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:58.560]   We eat ice cream, we get that brain freeze.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.940]   I can feel it right now a little bit subjectively.
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:02.860]   I can induce it.
[01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:04.000]   What's going on there?
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.200]   And I would always just rub my tongue
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.220]   on the roof of my mouth.
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:09.760]   Is there something that I'm doing that's functional there
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.320]   just to try and alleviate it?
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.160]   - Good question.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:14.320]   The thing is that the roof of your mouth
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:16.780]   is very close to your hypothalamus.
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:20.020]   So if indeed it's a popsicle
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:21.600]   that's giving you the brain freeze,
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:24.720]   it may be a direct cooling effect
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:25.800]   from the roof of your mouth.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:26.860]   You put your tongue there,
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:28.860]   you're insulating the roof of your mouth.
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:30.540]   I don't know, I'm guessing.
[01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:32.740]   - But what's the source of the brain freeze?
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.220]   Is it a vasoconstriction?
[01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:36.820]   - It's a vasomotor change.
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:37.980]   Whether it's constriction,
[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:39.960]   I think it's more likely a vaso,
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.820]   an increase in blood pressure,
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.600]   which will essentially cause an expansion of the arteries
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:48.200]   and activate pain receptors.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.860]   We don't have pain receptors in the neural tissue,
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:51.700]   in the brain.
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:53.280]   We have them in the meninges
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:56.320]   and predominantly associated with the blood vessels,
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.900]   the walls of the blood vessels.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:00.880]   So if you have something which will dramatically
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:05.840]   increase your blood pressure going to the brain,
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.240]   you're likely to get a...
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:11.040]   We've had some preliminary data.
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.420]   I even hate to mention this
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:15.440]   because we have not been able to pursue it
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:19.980]   systematically, but we've had some experience
[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:22.780]   with people with migraine that say,
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:26.980]   if they use one of our devices to heat,
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:28.340]   that the migraine goes away.
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:31.940]   And I don't know.
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:32.940]   - Yeah, it's very interesting.
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.340]   A lot of people suffer from migraine.
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.780]   I know there are a lot of different types of migraine.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:37.620]   - Right.
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:38.640]   - I've been reading a lot about this lately
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:42.620]   because I get so many questions about migraine, but-
[01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:43.660]   - I hate to say anything.
[01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:46.140]   - Sure, and we'll just underscore this is preliminary.
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:49.420]   And people have been great about understanding
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:50.720]   that when we say preliminary,
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:54.660]   we mean it has not passed through the required filters
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:57.960]   to call it a hard fact yet.
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.900]   - We don't even have a decent data set.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:00.740]   - Right.
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.420]   - It's just these are anecdotal reports.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:03.980]   - Anecdota as people like to know,
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.440]   but I don't even like to call it that
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:07.540]   because then we don't want to give it more weight
[01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:09.900]   than it deserves, but that's interesting.
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:12.540]   The ice headache and the increase in blood pressure
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:15.380]   is interesting because the only thing that I've heard
[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:19.340]   is similar to it is something that comes from,
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:21.060]   they have these competitions where people eat
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:23.100]   these very hot chili peppers.
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:26.380]   It's kind of an ego thing, I guess,
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:29.840]   for reasons that escape me, that eating really hot peppers.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.940]   And every once in a while, someone will eat one of these
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:33.920]   and get what's called thunderclap headache,
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:36.940]   where a headache comes on extremely quickly
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:39.540]   and so quickly that it's caused,
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:43.140]   so severe, rather, that it's been known to cause stroke
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:44.520]   and brain damage.
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:46.700]   So these very, very hot peppers,
[01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:48.380]   if you're not acclimated to them,
[01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:51.120]   and maybe even if you are, have been shown to cause,
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:52.260]   actually cause brain damage.
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:54.220]   Yeah, some good evidence for this.
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:58.360]   I do want to talk about something
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:02.900]   that we have not touched on yet, which is NEAT,
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:07.140]   non-exercise induced thermogenesis, right?
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:11.280]   So non-activity associated thermogenesis
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.940]   and the fidgeters, right?
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:15.900]   So the classic work of like Rothwell and Stock
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:19.820]   and the idea that some people who overeat
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:23.740]   are burning off that energy by way of shaking their knee
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:24.860]   or moving around a lot.
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:26.860]   These are the kind of nerve, they quote,
[01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:28.020]   quote, unquote, nervous types.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:33.020]   But they quoted in those studies a huge degree
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:36.960]   of caloric burn, you know, 800, 2,500 calories per day
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:39.960]   burned above those who sit rather still.
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:42.140]   Does that seem far-fetched?
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:45.260]   Those are older data, but any comment on NEAT
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:48.420]   or non-exercise induced thermogenesis?
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:50.640]   - Well, I do think it's pretty straightforward
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:53.220]   that if you increase muscle activity of any kind,
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:55.720]   you're increasing your energy consumption
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:57.460]   and your heat production.
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:38:59.760]   And no, the really extreme example
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.820]   is hyper and hypothyroidism.
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:05.680]   People that are hyperthyroid are fidgety
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:09.360]   and they have a high metabolic rate and they're hot.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:12.260]   And people that are hypothermic are cool.
[01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:15.200]   They don't move very much.
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.780]   So any kind of muscle activity increases.
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:20.540]   And when you say it's not much activity,
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:23.440]   but remember it's only 20% effective.
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:26.900]   80% of the energy is going to heat.
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:32.220]   So it may not exert much energy to tap your foot,
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:35.700]   but four times the amount of energy
[01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:39.360]   that is going into the movement is being lost as heat.
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.860]   - That's very interesting.
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:44.080]   A couple more quick questions.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:46.300]   There's a lot of excitement these days,
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:48.940]   or at least usage these days of so-called energy drinks
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:50.620]   or pre-workout drinks.
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:53.340]   Many of these contain thermogenic compounds.
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:55.540]   So caffeine, things,
[01:39:55.540 --> 01:40:00.540]   there's a culture now of taking arginine,
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:03.700]   things that support arginine, so beet juice
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:08.020]   and L-citrulline, things to dilate the blood vessels.
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:10.540]   Sometimes this is for sake of increasing blood flow
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:12.200]   to the muscles during resistance exercise.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.180]   But a lot of these are thermogenic.
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:16.320]   It's to increase body temperature.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:19.140]   And is it possible that some of these energy drinks
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:21.660]   are actually, or similar,
[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:23.600]   six espresso or whatever it is,
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:27.560]   are acting to prevent optimal performance
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:29.340]   or reduce performance?
[01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:33.660]   - I don't think that the temperature rise is that.
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:35.660]   I really don't know.
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:38.800]   But what it does is it makes you more jittery
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.900]   and you're going to increase that neat
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:42.340]   that you were talking about.
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:44.340]   Or it's another thing,
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:48.720]   and that is that when you are exercising your muscle
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:52.300]   and it becomes slightly hypoxic,
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:56.780]   I mean, the oxygen supply is not enough,
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:59.760]   the muscle releases adenosine.
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:01.880]   And what adenosine does in the muscle
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:05.660]   is cause the blood vessels to open up, to dilate.
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:09.220]   So it's a way of increasing the blood flow to the muscle
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:11.620]   and therefore the oxygen supply to the muscle.
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:14.780]   - And caffeine is essentially an adenosine antagonist.
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:16.780]   - An adenosine antagonist, right.
[01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:21.500]   - So under the strict logic, ingesting caffeine
[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.460]   will reduce adenosine release
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:27.480]   and will reduce oxygen utilization at the muscle.
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.520]   So that would lead me to believe
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:33.340]   that motivational support aside,
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:37.020]   that caffeine will hinder muscular performance.
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:38.120]   - I would think so,
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:43.120]   but I can't give you an authoritative answer on that.
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:46.340]   - Okay, we're just going through the logic
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:48.060]   and the gymnastics around that.
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:52.480]   I think it's a fascinating area that deserves attention
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:56.400]   because the question of what one can ingest
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.980]   in order to perform better,
[01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:00.900]   to say nothing of hormone augmentation,
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:05.900]   but has often leads back to stimulants.
[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:08.060]   And if those stimulants,
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:10.760]   most of which include caffeine of some sort,
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:13.080]   are inhibiting the adenosine system
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:14.000]   and the adenosine system
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000]   is supporting the oxygenation of muscle,
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.960]   then I would imagine that avoiding them
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:21.860]   might be the better option.
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:26.860]   - Yeah, I just am not aware of data that would...
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:30.400]   So this is a general phenomenon of adenosine
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:31.880]   and blood flow.
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:34.360]   It has, of course, a different effect in the brain.
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:38.620]   Adenosine causes sleep, so caffeine keeps you awake.
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:40.280]   And if you stay awake,
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:42.000]   you're going to have a higher metabolic rate
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.140]   than if you go to sleep.
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:48.940]   So, and the thing is you say energy drinks,
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:52.240]   the question is, what really is in them?
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:54.320]   - It's usually a cocktail of things.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.020]   I don't take these, I don't like them at all,
[01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:59.280]   but they're usually a combination of vasodilators,
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:01.280]   stimulant, caffeine, some sort of stimulant.
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.760]   - And a source of glucose.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.000]   - Sometimes a source of glucose and sometimes not.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:10.000]   And oftentimes there are vasodilators
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.160]   and there are compounds
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:16.760]   that are thought to be so-called nootropics, smart drugs,
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.840]   that basically increase acetylcholine
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:21.080]   or norepinephrine transmission.
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:25.280]   You know, in the '80s and '90s,
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.680]   the beta-3 agonists like clambuterol were very popular,
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:30.100]   but they were all banned.
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:32.300]   So those are all banned from,
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:33.920]   although people use them recreationally,
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:35.560]   which I do not recommend.
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:36.880]   There were actually a number of deaths
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:39.560]   due to dehydration, overheating,
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.660]   as well as cardiac effects.
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:44.060]   Before we wrap up,
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:46.780]   I know you've done a ton of work on sleep.
[01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:48.700]   I think we're going to have to do another episode
[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:50.200]   about your work on sleep
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:53.440]   because the amount of data that you produce there is vast.
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:56.240]   Actually, that's how I first got to know you and your work
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:59.400]   related to sleep and temperature.
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.960]   We all hear nowadays that it's good to keep the room
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:05.480]   that you sleep in cool, keep it dark.
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:08.480]   I've talked a number of times on podcast episodes
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:11.780]   about the role of light and shifting in circadian rhythms.
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:15.140]   I have two questions related to sleep.
[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:19.440]   One is, are there any things that may
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:21.420]   or may not relate to temperature,
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:26.000]   but that you think are very useful for getting better sleep
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.020]   that you don't hear that much about,
[01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:33.120]   that people might want to consider or try,
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:34.480]   realizing that there are a lot of reasons
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.460]   why people don't sleep great,
[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:39.280]   but what are some things that you don't hear
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:43.080]   that much about these days that you wish people knew?
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:45.640]   - Well, the sleep medicine community
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:48.140]   now puts a lot more emphasis
[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:53.140]   on cognitive behavioral therapy than on pharmacology.
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:55.920]   So what cognitive behavioral therapy does
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:59.720]   is it essentially increases your sleep hygiene.
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.700]   So there are certain just general rules.
[01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:06.200]   So have a regular bedtime and a regular arousal time.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.860]   Don't be skipping back and forth all the time.
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:10.180]   - Arousal, you mean wake up time.
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:11.200]   - Wake up time, yeah.
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:12.560]   - Spoken like a true physiologist.
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:15.220]   [both laughing]
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:20.760]   - Another thing is don't use screens
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:22.480]   within a couple hours of bedtime
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:26.820]   because screens are predominantly rich in blue light.
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:29.540]   And what that does is you mentioned the circadian system.
[01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:31.540]   That affects your circadian system.
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:36.540]   That pushes off your circadian stimulus for sleep, okay?
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:40.480]   Another thing is of course, relax.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.560]   I mean, don't work right up till the time
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:44.240]   you're going to bed.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.600]   Take some time to do something relaxing.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.160]   And then temperature, you've mentioned that.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:53.320]   And for many people, a warm bath
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:57.000]   is really conducive to good sleep.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.240]   And people are now swearing
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:02.640]   by a cooler environment for sleep.
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:06.080]   And that makes sense in terms of the circadian effect
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.680]   on body temperature.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:12.680]   So our circadian clock is affecting our thermostat.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:14.880]   So at the time we go to bed,
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:19.720]   our thermostat is on its way down to a lower set point.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:20.560]   So what happens?
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:24.040]   You go to bed and you're feeling a little bit cool.
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:26.880]   So you pile on lots of blankets.
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:29.880]   And then what happens is you wake up a little bit later
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:31.300]   and you're hot, so you throw them off.
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:35.160]   It's because your thermostat has set downward.
[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:37.720]   Now, why is it better to have a cool environment?
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:39.340]   It's better to have a cool environment
[01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:42.280]   because it's easier to thermoregulate.
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:44.680]   So you can go to Europe in the summertime
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:47.920]   and the hotel rooms still have these big comforters,
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:50.000]   these down comforters.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.760]   So how do you deal with that?
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.960]   You stick out your hands and your legs, okay?
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:56.000]   - I've always slept with,
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.960]   I have one leg that just kind of hangs out of the, yeah.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:03.360]   - But that's, they're your heat loss surfaces, right?
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:04.840]   So if you're in a cool environment,
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:06.600]   you can take advantage of that.
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:09.340]   You can take advantage by passively
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:10.960]   regulating your body temperature.
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:13.840]   You don't have to get up and wake up and say,
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.640]   "Oh my God, I've got to change the covers or blankets,"
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:17.680]   or what have you.
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:20.800]   If you're in a warm environment, what can you do?
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:23.600]   - You need to sleep with one hand in the cool mitt, right?
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:25.480]   And right now that's not available yet.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.960]   - Right, it's not available.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.760]   - I've never heard about it that way.
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:31.140]   I've always heard you want to sleep in a cool room
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:33.100]   or keep the room cold.
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:35.740]   But I never realized why that's useful,
[01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:37.300]   which is, as you're saying,
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:41.620]   that then you can move these glabrous surfaces in and out.
[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:43.220]   You could even also sometimes even wake up
[01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:45.300]   under the blanket completely.
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:47.140]   Very, very interesting.
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:51.940]   That finally a rational science grounded explanation
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:53.620]   for why we need to sleep in a cool room.
[01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:54.460]   'Cause I always thought,
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:56.100]   well, if your temperature is going down anyway,
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:57.620]   why do you have to sleep in a cool room?
[01:47:57.620 --> 01:47:59.380]   What about wearing socks while you sleep?
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:01.020]   That was big a few years ago where they said,
[01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:02.820]   you know, you should put socks on.
[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:05.300]   Now I would think that's probably the wrong advice.
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:06.140]   You probably just-
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:08.260]   - Well, I don't know if it's wrong advice.
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:12.220]   There's an old, old study that was supported by,
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:17.220]   I think, Eddie Bauer, the sleeping bag company.
[01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:19.000]   And what the study showed,
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.380]   what the study was asking is,
[01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:24.340]   what are the most temperature sensitive spots in the body?
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:26.020]   Where do you feel cold?
[01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:28.900]   And what that showed was it was the toes.
[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:29.900]   So- - Makes sense.
[01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:31.720]   So when you sample water with your toe,
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:33.560]   you always see that-
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:37.600]   - So the socks essentially are promoting thermal comfort
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:40.900]   by insulating that area that's quite sensitive.
[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:42.120]   Now, of course, if it's too warm,
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:43.420]   you're not going to put socks on.
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:44.460]   - Right.
[01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:47.000]   Well, Craig, thank you so much.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.800]   You gave so much information
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:51.760]   that's actionable and interesting.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:55.060]   I know a lot of people are going to be really interested
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:58.540]   in the Palmer Cooling Technology from Coolmit.
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:01.020]   We will be sure to provide resources to the website
[01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:03.020]   so that people can register interest.
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:08.020]   I do encourage people to play around with, so to speak,
[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:12.600]   the Palmer Cooling Technology that we all have,
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:15.040]   which are these glabrous surfaces.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:16.760]   And I also just want to thank you
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:18.760]   for taking time out of your busy schedule
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:20.380]   to share this information. - Sure, you're welcome.
[01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:22.800]   It was fun, it was lots of fun.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:24.000]   - I certainly learned a lot,
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.560]   and I know a lot of people are going to learn a lot
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:27.700]   that's useful to them.
[01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:28.700]   - Good questions.
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:30.920]   - Well, fabulous answers, thank you.
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:31.760]   - Thank you.
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:33.220]   - Thank you for joining for my discussion
[01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:35.020]   with Dr. Craig Heller.

[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.080]   In addition, if you're interested in supporting research
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:08.800]   in the Huberman Lab at Stanford,
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:13.300]   you can go to Hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving,
[01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:15.560]   and there you can make a tax-deductible donation
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:17.480]   to support research in my laboratory
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:20.840]   on stress, human performance, sleep, and trauma,
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:22.280]   and topics of that sort.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:24.760]   If you're not already following us at Huberman Lab
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:27.600]   on Instagram or Twitter, you're welcome to do so.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:31.120]   On Instagram, I do short neuroscience tutorials
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.040]   that are separate from the tutorials
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:35.480]   that I tend to do on the podcast.
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:38.040]   Often on this podcast, we discuss supplements.
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:39.640]   One of the really important things
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:41.120]   if you're going to take supplements
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:43.900]   is that the supplements be of the highest quality ingredients
[01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:46.320]   and that the amount of those ingredients
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.580]   that's listed on the label actually matches
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:50.900]   what is in those supplements.
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:53.280]   We partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:55.760]   because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:58.920]   in terms of quality and how much of each supplement
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.880]   they put in their products.
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.600]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:07.600]   you can go to Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman,
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:09.600]   and there you can see what I take.
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:11.920]   You can get 20% off any of those supplements
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:14.080]   if you enter the Thorne site through that portal.
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:16.340]   And even if you navigate to other products
