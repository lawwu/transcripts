[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.060]   Do you recommend that your clients make specific subtle changes, behavioral changes after they have an insight or maybe even before they have an insight?
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:22.920]   I think the reason that people have so much trouble changing is because the step that they've chosen is too big of a step to take at once.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.420]   You need small manageable steps.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.460]   And I think people also forget this is why New Year's resolutions tend not to last very long because change is a process.
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.380]   And there's a chapter in my book called How Humans Change.
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.420]   And I think it's so important for people to understand that there are stages of change.
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.680]   And it starts with pre-contemplation where you don't even realize that you're thinking about making a change.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.160]   You think like something's not right, but I don't really need to change.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.920]   Like something's just not right in the world.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.960]   You know, it's my partner.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.060]   It's my, you know, it's my child.
[00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.180]   It's my whoever, right?
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:04.500]   Then there's contemplation, which is, oh, maybe I could make a change, but I'm not quite ready to do it.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.380]   And that's when people usually, they come to therapy somewhere around pre-contemplation.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.100]   It's kind of between pre-contemplation and contemplation.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.660]   Like something's not right.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.460]   They come to therapy.
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.220]   We get them to contemplation, which is like, oh, maybe I'm contemplating making some changes.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.300]   And then there's preparation, which is you're taking some steps to prepare for the change.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.780]   So it's not like I'm going to dive into the deep end of the pool.
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.220]   It's like, oh, maybe I need to take some swimming lessons or maybe I need to get a swimsuit or maybe I need, you know, whatever it is.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.160]   Like I need to prepare to make this change.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.040]   And then there's action where you actually make the change.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.560]   And people think that's the last step.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.380]   That's action.
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.940]   No.
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.920]   The last stage is maintenance.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.460]   And maintenance is how do you maintain the change?
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.300]   And maintenance does not mean that you are perfectly maintaining the change.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.220]   It's more like chutes and ladders, if you remember that game, where like kind of you go up and then you go down.
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.640]   You can make mistakes during this time because you're forming a new habit.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.120]   You're forming a new way of being.
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:13.100]   And until it becomes familiar, going back to our discussion about how the familiar feels really good to us and the unfamiliar feels really scary, the new thing will take a while to feel familiar.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.180]   So let's say that you say, like, I'm going to eat healthy.
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.120]   And that means that I'm not going to, you know, like eat an entire Haagen-Dazs or something when I'm sad.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.520]   Then I'm going to do something different.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.220]   Well, sometimes when you're sad, you might do that again.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.660]   But then you don't self-flagellate.
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.820]   So it's not like, oh, it failed, so forget it.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.960]   I'm not going to, like, I failed and I'm not able to make this change.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.320]   No.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.520]   Or you don't say like, oh, I'm so terrible and that was awful and I'm so weak.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.100]   Self-flagellation is not helpful.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.300]   Imagine if your kid came to you and they said, like, I did really poorly on this test.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.820]   Are you going to say, you're so stupid?
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.560]   You know, like, what's wrong with you?
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.380]   No.
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.680]   You're going to say, well, let's talk about what happened.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.980]   And they might say, I needed help and I was embarrassed to ask or I didn't understand it and – or I didn't study.
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.920]   I messed up.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.600]   I should have studied and I didn't study.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.260]   Okay.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.340]   Well, what are you going to do differently next time?
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.460]   Let's come up with a plan.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.660]   So you need to have – just like you'd have some compassion for your child and hold them accountable, both.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.440]   It's hard to hold yourself accountable when you self-flagellate.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.940]   In the short term, you can, but it doesn't last because it feels so unpleasant.
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.520]   You're just sort of bathing in shame.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.980]   What you need is self-compassion and actually if you have more compassion for yourself, you're more able to hold yourself accountable.
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.740]   So you can say, oh, you know what happened?
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.460]   I was feeling really sad.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.960]   I had this whole pint of Haagen-Dazs.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.900]   But it's okay that I was sad.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.440]   And there's another way to do this.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.140]   So next time when I'm sad, I didn't have enough support.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.920]   So I'm going to call a friend next time.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.580]   Oh, self-compassion with accountability.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Or I'm not going to keep the Haagen-Dazs in the house because I know that when I'm sad, I'm susceptible to that.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.440]   Maybe one day I'll be able to do it.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.580]   But right now, I'm not going to keep that.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.320]   But there's something else I can do, which is I really feel like I want – for me, self-compassion is related to I'm going to give myself a treat.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.720]   So maybe my treat is I'm going to, you know, I'm going to have like a healthy snack that I like.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.300]   Or maybe my treat is I'm going to go to a movie or, you know, whatever it is.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.780]   But you have to figure out what works for you and what works for other people might not work for you.
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.920]   So it takes a little bit of experimenting.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:33.120]   So maintenance is this kind of experimentation but having self-compassion with accountability until you find a system that works for you and the new thing becomes a habit.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.100]   It becomes familiar.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.820]   And the thing that you used to do becomes unfamiliar and doesn't feel good anymore.
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.820]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:47.100]   For so many years, the field of popular psychology was obsessed with, you know, how long does it take to make a change?
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.180]   It was like 28 days.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.840]   And it was like 90.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.300]   I was like – as somebody who studies neuroplasticity, I can tell you that there's one trial learning.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.280]   You'll never go back.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.020]   And there's stuff that takes years.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.060]   It just depends on the intensity and the consequences, right?
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:11.540]   And even with consequences, I mean, anyone that's seen somebody relapse from drugs so many times over, it's – you know, clearly they're working with more complicated dynamics there.
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.340]   I think that this notion of reinforcing change is super key.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.480]   I'm really glad you raised that.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.480]   I'm really glad you're working with me because I'm really glad you're working with me because I know it's – I'm really glad you're working with me because I'm really glad you're working with me.
