[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.560]   Our next question comes from Jim the CFO. Jim asks, "What are your thoughts on leveraging the
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.560]   mind's daydreaming mode for creativity and problem solving versus productive meditation?"
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.840]   Well, as longtime listeners know, productive meditation is a cognitive training exercise
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.080]   where you maintain your focus on a single professional problem while you walk. When
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.480]   your mind wanders, you bring it back to the problem. If you do this over time, you will
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.360]   greatly expand your ability to focus your mind's eye on a single topic. You'll expand your working
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.880]   memory capacity. You'll expand your ability to just in your brain itself manipulate variables
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.240]   and schemas and make cognitive progress. It's pull-ups for your brain, and it's something I
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:58.080]   recommend. Jim is asking about daydream mode. You know, what about just letting your mind wander
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.600]   as a way of finding a solution to a problem? Well, Jim, I'm also a believer in that. There's an
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.320]   actual school of study on this topic. It's called UTT Unconscious Thought Theory. They tried to
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.840]   actually study this in the lab. They found some results, but then UTT suffered from a replication
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.760]   crisis. Some people tried the same studies and couldn't replicate those results. But let's ignore
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.720]   the research for now. And I will just tell you, Jim, anyone who is a practicing academic
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.960]   theoretician, someone who does applied math or theoretical computer science like I do,
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.400]   will tell you in our experience that it works. You know, you want to work on something hard,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.320]   but when you come back to it the next day or the next week, you're often surprised by the
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.320]   new angles you have on it. Some sort of unconscious processing seemed to unfold.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.400]   I find the same thing happens to me when I do peer reviews. When I'm reviewing, for example,
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.600]   a journal paper, I'll read the paper, and I'll think to myself, despairingly,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.920]   "I don'tâ€”this is too complicated. I don't know what's going on here." And then I'll come back
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.840]   to it and start writing up my review. And I'm looking at my summary of this paper and saying,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.440]   "Wow, my brain understands this paper way better than I do. Like, I didn't understand these nuances,
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.840]   my brain was figuring out in the background." So I do think that happens. Do you need to do
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.360]   anything proactively to try to leverage this unconscious thought? Not really. When you're
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.880]   working on something, work on something. When you're done, be done and do other things.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.120]   When you return to it, hopefully you've made some progress. I don't think there's something you have
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.880]   to plan here. I don't think there's a strategy you have to develop. Unless you're thinking about
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.360]   this problem every waking hour, day after day, you'll have plenty of downtime when your brain
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.720]   is not thinking about the problem. So just to see this as a gift, you know, if I come back to
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.760]   something, I might be smarter than I was the last time I tackled it. If I was to give any concrete
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.040]   advice here, it might be, don't do too much in one session. If you're trying to do something hard,
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.640]   maybe have three sessions spread out instead of one big session. So you can leverage this effect
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.560]   more, you can leverage higher cognitive intensity, you can stave off cognitive fatigue. But otherwise,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.520]   I don't think there's much you have to plan here. I think we do get stuff done in our unconscious.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.720]   And we should be glad that that is true. But I don't know there's much from a productivity
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:18.640]   system standpoint that we need to do to take advantage of that.
