[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:44.920]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.480]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.800]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you on my journey to optimize my
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.160]   life.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.200]   First off, I'm so grateful for all the questions you've been sending in and I'll
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.480]   be releasing a Q&A episode soon, starting with a ton of great content on credit
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.880]   cards, points, and miles.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.920]   But today, we're talking to Chase Jarvis.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   And while you might not know him by name, I am sure you've seen his work.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.360]   He's one of the most influential and award-winning photographers, creating
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.320]   hundreds of campaigns for companies like Nike, Apple, Samsung, Google, and
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.840]   Red Bull.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.000]   He's written two best-selling photography books and was a contributor to the
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.040]   Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times story, Snowfall.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.160]   And if that's not enough, he is also a successful entrepreneur.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.640]   In 2009, he launched the Best Camera app, earning App of the Year, letting you
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.160]   share images directly to social networks, and the app is widely credited with
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.880]   kicking off the photo-sharing craze.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.120]   The next year, he founded CreativeLive, which was just acquired by Fiverr last
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.360]   month and is one of the world's largest live-streaming education companies.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.920]   So today, we're going to be talking about creativity.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.880]   Now, if you hear that and think, "Oh, that's not for me, I don't paint or do
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.880]   anything creative, we might be cut from the same cloth," because that is exactly
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.840]   the reaction I had when I started thinking about this conversation.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.480]   But as I started doing my homework, I realized I couldn't have been more wrong.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.840]   Part of that homework was reading Chase's new best-selling book, Creative
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.760]   Calling, "Establish a Daily Practice, Infuse Your World with Meaning, and
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.360]   Succeed in Work and Life."
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.320]   It was a fantastic read that really opened up my eyes to how I could optimize
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.280]   and upgrade my own life through creativity and creative practices.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.080]   I am incredibly honored and excited to be chatting with Chase Jarvis.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.360]   So let's jump in.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.960]   Chase, thanks for being here.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.680]   Thanks for saying all those nice things about me, Chris.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.360]   Yeah, it's always good to flatter someone before you're going to
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.240]   interrogate them about all kinds of things.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.200]   Oh, stop, stop.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.000]   So I would say you have quite an intimidating creative background.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.080]   Were you born into this journey or how did it all come about?
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.160]   Were you always this kind of creative icon in your peer group?
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.280]   Interesting.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.000]   I'll start with a short story and it goes back to second grade.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.760]   Okay.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.680]   So my teacher, actually, it's going to go to first grade.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.320]   The summer between first and second, I made my first film.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.240]   Me and a couple of buddies in the neighborhood, we washed a bunch of cars
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.760]   and did some yard work to get enough money to buy two rolls of Super 8 film.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.880]   And then we hired my buddy's brother, Derek, for $1 to be our cinematographer.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.240]   We, we scripted, made our costumes and it was called the sons of Zorro.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.560]   It was a blockbuster.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.120]   The funny thing is in addition to making the film, there was
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.680]   a business aspect of it, right?
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.080]   We had to pay all that, lay all this money out to make the film.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.120]   And then we went and bought a bunch of concessions.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.000]   We put flyers up all over the neighborhood.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.720]   We screened the film to a sold out audience, and we actually
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.400]   made a profit on our first film.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.840]   And I, again, this was the summer routine first and second grade.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.320]   So I'm rolling into second grade thinking I'm the shit, right?
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.520]   Movie maker.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.120]   This is going to be cool.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.920]   And I had a little magic act that I had going on.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.720]   I had a little standup comedy routine and second grade kicks off and I'm loving it.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.400]   And that's right before the holiday break.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.880]   So we're recording this around Thanksgiving time here in the U S in 2021.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.360]   So it was roughly the same time of year.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.600]   Take me back second grade.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.240]   Before the holiday break, there's this thing called the ice cream social and the
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.440]   there's student or parent teacher conferences.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.080]   So I'm at school after the day is done and the parents show up and I'm eating
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.600]   ice cream with friends running around the halls and I dug in just to hear, just in
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.560]   time to hear my second grade teacher, miss Kelly, tell my parents that Chase is so
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.040]   much better at sports than he is at art.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.160]   And I'm like, okay.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.920]   And right now, if you're driving your car, listen to this podcast and you're
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.560]   like, Oh, poor little Chase, you know, actually I didn't, it wasn't poor little
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.800]   Chase.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.520]   It was like, Oh, okay.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.800]   That was a piece of programming that I took and said, okay, great.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.320]   I'm going to pay more attention to the thing that the teacher thinks I'm good at
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.080]   because whether we like it or not, we're social animals and we all can get
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.120]   acceptance and we want to lean into those things where other people find virtue and
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.040]   value in us and steer away from those that where, where we are, uh, so say less
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.800]   encouraged.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.000]   And so started my creative journey.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.480]   Fast forward.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.800]   I ended up going to college on a soccer scholarship.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.720]   I played soccer and football, could have played either, could have gone on to
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.880]   soccer professionally.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.800]   And at some point I'm recognizing that there's this side of myself that I have
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.040]   been denying for since largely second grade.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.680]   And I didn't build an identity around being a creator, although I was a skate
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.160]   punk and we enjoyed building our own skate ramps and punk rock music and spray
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.680]   painting and all that kind of stuff.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.360]   So there was all kinds of creative activities, but my identity was wrapped up
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.720]   in the thing that the adults in my life wanted for me and my parents, career
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.200]   counselors, grandparents, teachers, these people that we largely respect and
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.720]   admire were steering me to do, to stay focused on sports.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.760]   And I was fine academically.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.560]   I was solid.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.160]   But my punchline here is you open the show with questioning whether or not you
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.480]   had a creative sort of identity or you're aware of the creativity that resides
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.920]   within you and that you create something every day, all day long.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.240]   You're a creative machine, Chris.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.880]   And I had that same experience, right?
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.280]   Creativity is something that's trained out of us, not trained into us.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.080]   The cool thing about it is it's a flame inside us that never goes out.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.200]   And I believe I wrote the book creative calling.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.680]   I started creative live and all these creative apps and basically everything
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.600]   in my entrepreneurial and creative journey has been around trying to cultivate
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.680]   this, understand it better and share it with others.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.880]   So the short answer to your question is no, I was not raised in a world.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.800]   My dad was a cop.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.080]   My mom was a secretary at a biotech company.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.680]   It wasn't thought of as critical for my upbringing.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.040]   And yet when I looked around at what is creativity and how valuable could it be?
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.440]   I like so many people who you identified yourself as one of these people in the
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.000]   intro were unclear about what that even means and the value that represents in
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.400]   the world.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.320]   So no, it wasn't in my background.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:24.840]   Yes.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.040]   I think it's the most important and urgent thing we can do is understand and
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.640]   acknowledge our personal creative journey.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.480]   It's funny.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.280]   One of the things in your story that you shared rung similar to me, which was
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.520]   about making movies.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.520]   So I remember I read this book, "Rodamonte's Revenge."
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.720]   It was like a 75 page sci-fi book.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.760]   And so for a project, a friend of mine, I made a movie and we submitted it as a
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.800]   school project.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.560]   And I think back to all the boxes my parents kept of things as a kid, I was all
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.080]   with drawings and all that stuff.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.560]   As a child, we were so much more creative.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.760]   We were drawing, playing make-believe.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.400]   I went to my neighbor's house the other day and there's all these kids that made
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.320]   up a game in the backyard where they draw things and hide them.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.480]   Are we less creative as we're older?
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.840]   What is that journey like?
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   Because it feels like it was so much stronger and part of our identity as
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.560]   children and it somehow, and maybe you know why, but somehow it waned as we got
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:19.920]   older.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.400]   Well, there's science here at work.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.760]   And then I can also share, I believe that almost everyone's empirical experience,
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.520]   at least if it doesn't echo this sentiment, it's present somewhere in your
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.040]   past.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.240]   If you stand up in front of any first grade classroom, second grade classroom,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.880]   say, "Who wants to come up to the front and draw me a picture?"
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.080]   Every single hand goes up.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.440]   Every single hand.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.640]   There's not judgment around, "Oh, cool.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.480]   I want to draw."
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.400]   Does anybody here not want to draw or play a game or create a story together?
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.840]   Everyone says yes at first, second grade.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.960]   And then you go to fifth, sixth grade and it's a third of the hands and you go to
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.640]   high school and it's two hands out of 30.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.720]   And this is what I mean.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.440]   And I do believe this is changing.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.760]   So I want to put a pin in this.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.880]   We can revisit it later.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:12.040]   But ultimately we are emerging from a time, thankfully, we're leaving a time
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.440]   period where the concept of creativity was seen as optional.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.680]   I think of what our parents and our parents' parents were coming out of the
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.920]   industrial revolution, factories.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.280]   The education system was based largely on the factory.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.640]   Like you put all the kids in the widgets in one end, you put them through this
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.920]   black box, everybody learns the same thing at the same time in the same way.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.280]   And then they come out the other end.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.000]   That, first of all, is not how human beings learn.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.760]   We all learn differently through different modalities.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:46.400]   And so it's easy to see why this thing that is very intangible,
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.640]   very difficult to describe.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.800]   We know it's valuable, but you can see how those things end up on the cutting
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:59.760]   room floor of a system that values homogeneity and simplicity and mass
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.000]   production, much like a factory.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.640]   So it's not easy or it's not hard.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:11.960]   It's not a stretch rather to understand why we are in this situation and why you
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.320]   notice that your friends and their friends' kids are joyful and playing and
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.120]   creating like crazy imaginative stuff.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.880]   And yet here we are like, okay, I got to pay the bills.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.520]   Got to do this.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.520]   My spreadsheet is up to, is it, you're looking at a spreadsheet right now of all
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.960]   the things I need to talk to Chase about.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:34.160]   And it's just important for us to be aware, like we can respond to things if we
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.240]   are aware that they have, that has happened.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.680]   So anyone who's listening right now who hasn't, doesn't identify as a creative
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.080]   person or a creator, let's just put a pin in that too, because we're going to come
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.120]   back, I'm going to beat you over the head with the fact that absolutely you are
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.760]   creative, that Chris, you and I are co-creating this conversation right now.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.040]   If you just started screaming in your microphone, it would dramatically change
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.800]   the trajectory of our conversation.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.880]   Is there like a specific definition you use to define creativity?
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.920]   Creativity, the way that I think about it and talk about it in my book, it's a
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.160]   very, it's a widely accepted definition.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.960]   It's just taking two or more things and combining them in an unlikely and
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.840]   ideally useful way.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.160]   So there's an element of utility there.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.040]   Even painting can be, the utility of painting is to make you feel an emotion
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.880]   or making a film, for example, is to understand a story or narrative
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.960]   and connect with that narrative.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.600]   And, you know, it helps you see that science is wildly creative.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.840]   Computer coding, wildly creative.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.280]   The light that we all take for granted right now, right?
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.880]   That's just electrical engineering plus creativity.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.120]   It took Einstein, however many thousand, 10,000 experiments gone wrong in
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.440]   order to create the light bulb.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.280]   We even use the word create the light bulb.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.120]   And we think of that as hard science.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:58.000]   So when you start to see that you're just combining things in new and interesting
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.960]   ways to make useful stuff, you start to realize that creativity is all around us.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.120]   Looking back now on different things in my life and saying, oh, there was
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.040]   creativity there.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.720]   My friend and I both had children around the same time.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.760]   What device can we create to feed a bottle to a baby without having to hold it?
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.000]   And we were like, oh, if you take a gallon size Ziploc and you fill it half
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.560]   with air, it's like the perfect pillow and cradle for a bottle.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.360]   And now talking to you, I'm like, that was probably a really creative moment.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.040]   Whereas in the time I was like, just I'm solving a problem.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.280]   It doesn't feel like creativity.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.160]   That's the cool thing about creativity.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:41.440]   Again, this scale is really where I'm trying to focus people's attention.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.240]   Because if you can, it is not a stretch.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:50.520]   It is not a logic, it is not illogical or not a logical fallacy that if creativity
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:57.400]   is defined by combining two or more things in new and useful ways, ideally
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.560]   useful, then you're like, wow, okay.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:05.000]   If you can identify or agree with that, that's a pretty easy step to recognize
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.080]   that what you just did with that bottle was even called it an invention.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.000]   You're inventing.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.080]   We use words like innovation all the time, but what is innovation
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.000]   if it's not creativity applied?
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.480]   So it's a pretty simple framework, a pretty simple argument
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.080]   for someone to buy into.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.520]   And for those of you who are identify as creative and listen to the show, great.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.080]   I don't need to bring you along, but for the doubters, hopefully
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.560]   the first nine minutes here.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.320]   As it will at least get you to understand, to listen to the next nine minutes and
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:44.000]   listen for the further rationale that this is a superpower.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.480]   I'm now accepting that creativity is something that happens all the time,
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.840]   whether I'm tweaking a recipe at dinner or creating a bottle holder.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.920]   And now what?
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.080]   Now I've accepted I'm creative and you've talked in the book about how creativity
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.800]   is something that's wildly important and as essential to health and wellbeing as
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.440]   exercise and nutrition and mindfulness.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.680]   So how do I use this newfound knowledge that I'm creative to benefit
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.800]   myself, to feel better, to be happier?
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.800]   I'll give you the vague concept first, and then I'll give you
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.520]   a very actionable approach.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.760]   And for some people, the vague notion is enough for them to grab onto it and put
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.840]   it to use and others may need something a little more structured.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.720]   So we'll cover both.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.760]   The first and more conceptual approach is okay.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:37.560]   If you acknowledge that creativity is all around you, what you really are doing is
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.360]   sweet.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.840]   I have the ability to shape my environment, right?
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.360]   I'm choosing the things that I will expose myself to.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.920]   I will craft a morning routine.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.680]   I will curate and cultivate the kinds of things that I let into my world.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.680]   Those are people, those are art, those are ideas.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:04.680]   And what you're doing is you're creating a framework for you to then go on and be
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.120]   able to live the life you want.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.360]   And again, for most people, you're like, oh, okay, I buy that.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:11.880]   I buy it.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.920]   And that's part of what I want.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.440]   There's a part in the book where I talk about, yes, this book is, if you identify
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.360]   as a creator, this will supercharge your photography, your design, your
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.880]   entrepreneurship, but really this is a book about life and how to live it.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.920]   And this is the place where I want to get people because then, you know, moving
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.760]   freely between cooking a meal and tweaking a recipe to use your example and
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.440]   designing a career art for yourself.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.760]   What do I want to do next?
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.520]   If I can, we have to spend our time some way and we all have to make money.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:51.160]   Why don't I do something that I love and make my, not just make a masterpiece, but
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.000]   make a masterpiece of my life.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.560]   To me, that's a much more interesting life lived.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.200]   And again, the people that you look up to respect and admire, they did not get that
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.120]   life on accident.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.040]   They created it very intentionally because if you do not continue creating it, if you
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.200]   stop, then you will, if you don't write your own script, somebody else will
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.080]   certainly write it for you.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.880]   So let's just say that I'm guessing that I got three quarters of the listeners to
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.560]   say, okay, cool.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.280]   I'm down with that.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:22.120]   If I recap that in my own words to try to bring it to life by recognizing that I'm a
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.560]   creator, I'm doing creative things, whether it's food or at work.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:32.360]   Or with my family, I'm now realizing that, wow, I actually have the ability to create
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.240]   things in life.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.880]   And I can apply that same lesson to what many people think of as, well, I need this
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.400]   job and I need to do this thing.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.640]   And this is how the day works.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.480]   And I have to do this thing.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.680]   I can now apply these creative lessons to how I can structure my day, how I can
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:51.520]   structure my career, how I can structure my life, where I live, and that the same
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.880]   muscles that I would use to do that can be improved and strengthened by these other
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.520]   creative acts.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.480]   So if cooking more and being more experimental, I'm strengthening the same muscle
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.520]   that I would use to plan my day and life.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.360]   You are a hundred percent correct.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.800]   And the science is very clear here.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.960]   Everyone on your show is probably aware in some way, shape or form of
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.760]   neuroplasticity.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.200]   This is what you are doing when you are picking up that hobby that you gave up when
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.200]   you were in seventh grade because playing the guitar wasn't cool at that time or
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:22.600]   something.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.560]   What you are doing when you re-engage with that and when you drive home a different
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:32.280]   way from work every day, or you actively are changing the recipe for the meal you're
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.960]   cooking for your family, your friend, your girlfriend, wife, husband, partner,
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:41.800]   whatever, that literally rewires your brain to new possibilities.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:48.680]   Because if you do not do those things, then those paths in your brain get, they're
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.280]   like grooves in pavement.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.960]   They become ever deepened.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:59.000]   And that lack of ability to escape those grooves, that is where monotony and a lack
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.480]   of innovation, a lack of a dynamic environment actually, I think, undermines the
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.360]   human spirit.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.600]   It undermines the things that you say, "Gosh, I wish I could do X or Y or Z."
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:15.880]   So, one, not changing all of those things and putting this to work in the way that
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:23.200]   you talked about, not only does it not make possibilities more possible, but it
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.560]   actually actively undermines those things.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.600]   So, yes, a hundred percent.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.640]   Now, I think we got three quarters of the listeners coming along with us at this
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:30.880]   point.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.960]   For that one quarter who was like, "Okay, I need something more concrete," you may
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:43.120]   have, or you may have heard of or be aware of a concept called a practice or a
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:43.920]   process.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.160]   What is the creative process?
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.440]   I have a very simple, and the book is actually divided into four sections, that
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.120]   this is a process that will work for a drawing that you want to make at your
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.560]   desk, for a book, or for your life.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.160]   Four simple steps.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.480]   And the acronym is IDEA, I-D-E-A.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:10.080]   And this is a four-step process that you can look at the creation of anything and
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.440]   say, "It went through these four processes."
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.120]   And when you are aware, it's again, like so many things, the awareness that this is
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.760]   happening and your ability to then focus on these as steps can actually, the
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:29.720]   increased awareness and focus will enhance your ability to do it more regularly with
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.880]   more consistency and I would argue more successfully.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.000]   So I stands for, this is imagine what's possible.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.200]   Before you create something, you have to say, "What do I want to create in this
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:41.480]   world?"
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.720]   Before you started this podcast, what do I want to do?
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.040]   Do I want to write a book?
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.320]   Do I want to chisel some concrete slabs and make a tablet?
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.120]   No, I want to create a podcast.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.840]   So you imagined what was possible.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.800]   Then you have to very simply design a plan.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.680]   This is just like building a house, right?
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.440]   You don't just start hammering shit together.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.640]   Imagine what you want to do, design a plan, execute that plan.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:11.000]   And then the A is what is the most commonly misunderstood, but one of the most
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.920]   important is we need to amplify this outcome.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:22.680]   And by amplify, create an audience for this thing, whether that's internal or
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.160]   external, whether that is, you just need to put it out into the world.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.760]   You need to share this because that is a very valuable feedback loop that will
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.480]   help you refine your creative endeavor, whatever the thing that you set out to
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.520]   create was.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.640]   So once again, imagine, design, execute, and amplify.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.840]   Four very simple steps that if you do not know where to get started, do this with
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.320]   anything.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.080]   You can do it right now.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.040]   I want to draw a picture.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.080]   What do I want to draw?
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.120]   I want to draw a monkey.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.000]   All right, I'm going to design how the monkey is going to look.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.400]   It's going to be hanging from a tree.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.520]   I'm going to make some funny circles on a page.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.200]   I executed that plan.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.560]   And then if I like what I, and then I'm going to show my partner and they're
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.680]   going to laugh at me and I'm going to get some feedback and go back and maybe
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.160]   refine it.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.880]   But the point is, this is a simple for, for this is literally how creativity
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.360]   works.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.800]   If you care, most people don't care cause they get concept one that we spent a
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.960]   little more time talking about.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.720]   If you don't get that, or if you want to make this a very repeatable process and
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.960]   you want to have a more scientific approach, if you're a, a scientist by
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.440]   trade or computer programmer, this may help.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:34.040]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.400]   start to emerge things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.280]   have too many manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:49.920]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,025, one 37,000.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.480]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.880]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.

[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.760]   accounting, financial management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.000]   25.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.120]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.960]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.680]   days, not weeks and drive down costs.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.280]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.

[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.920]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.800]   the companies I've run makes everything so much better.

[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:02.000]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.720]   is actually so good for you.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.480]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.360]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.360]   to consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.840]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.880]   leaves from 250 year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.800]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.040]   minerals, and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.200]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep because they're all in pre-measured
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.520]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel friendly.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.400]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.680]   green Pu-Erh for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-Erh, which
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.480]   helps kickstart digestion and metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.440]   good and probably one of my favorite things to drink, and if you need another
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.120]   reason, search for all the amazing research-backed benefits of polyphenols
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.080]   for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be happy
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.000]   that Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   world, but you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.640]   offers free U.S. shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee, and for a
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:24.080]   limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free Quiver with 12 tea samples

[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:42.800]   So how important when exercising our creative muscles is it to maybe go deep
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:48.200]   versus wide? So for example, I'm kind of like conversational in French, but I
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.560]   could probably be fluent, and so I could go really deep in on one thing, or I
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.840]   could go pretty wide and go read a book on something totally new like the
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.520]   history of manufacturing in the U.S., which is a wild, interesting thing to
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.400]   learn about, probably really spark some creative thoughts. How do you think
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.800]   about exercising deep in a practice, whether it's the guitar or cooking or
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.960]   something versus adding new things to your arsenal of learning and
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.840]   creativity? This is an interesting question, and it's interesting for me on
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.640]   a couple different axes. I'm going to try and go with the first and most
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.160]   obvious, which it depends on what your goals are. I believe, you know, there's a
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:33.280]   section in the book on mastery, and it's my personal belief having mastered
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.480]   photography. I've been named master of a bunch of different areas of photography
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:44.200]   by those groups that do such things, and I also am aware of my mastery of
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:50.120]   photography. It shows up in my resume and my bio and all that stuff, but one
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.880]   of the things that I love about going deep, and this is true about anything
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.680]   about going deep on any subject, is first of all, you tend to only go deep
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.800]   on something you love because that's what you're willing to do, and whether
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:13.200]   that is birding or mechanical engineering or podcasting or photography
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:20.520]   design, you name it, going deep on something and allowing yourself to, let's
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   just, for the most simple definition of mastery, let's say you've got 10,000
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.720]   hours, you know your way around the whole ecosystem. Maybe you don't know
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:32.120]   everything, but you are aware of your areas of opportunity to grow. When you
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:39.280]   have mastered something, you have the distinct benefit of being able to lift
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:46.000]   and stamp the concept of mastery onto other areas and master them in an
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   increasingly accelerated way, and our mutual friend Tim Ferriss, dear buddy of
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.960]   ours, and you can look at Tim, was a salsa dancer, a world champion, in fact,
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:03.080]   and before he was an author, and then he had, same thing I think with judo, he
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:10.640]   had mastered a couple of different areas, and then he was able to then apply what
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.520]   he had learned conceptually about how deep do you have to go, whether is it
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.640]   mastering a number of skills or is it mastering one skill or one technique, how
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.960]   do you learn, who are good mentors and coaches, you get a body of experience,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.840]   and then you can, not all of it applies to writing, for example, in Tim's case,
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:34.360]   but a lot of it does, and you see this pattern in someone who is world class at
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.760]   something, tends to be really freaking good at a bunch of things because they
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.680]   have then in turn expanded what they learned about mastering one thing to
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.920]   other things, not always the case. So to your question about if I want to be
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:53.960]   creative, should I go experimental in one thing or deep in others, I think it
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:59.240]   is a, it's a little bit of a yo-yo. The first thing you want to do is cover a
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.680]   broad set of interests. If you do not know what you are passionate about, if
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:08.960]   you do not know if it's the guitar or ceramics or needlepoint or cooking, then
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.920]   just experiment and play. And we can, there's a lot of cues from our childhood.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.360]   You talked about making films, you talked about your kids drawing, you know,
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.880]   there's all these cues of things that we loved in our history that as an adult,
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:26.120]   if you reconnect with some of these things, you will be shocked at how much
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:31.560]   joy it could create for you. So it depends then on where you are in that
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.560]   phase. The yo-yo part is go broad at first, then go super deep. And once you
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.280]   go super deep, you understand what mastery is, and then you can go broad
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.680]   again. You can start to play in a bunch of different areas and look for the next
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.760]   thing that you'd like to master.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.320]   Do you have some examples maybe from readers that have written in after
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.600]   applying some of these lessons from the book that might be really relatable to
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:55.640]   people about how creativity could change and reshape someone's life who is not
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.520]   really thinking about it?
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:01.160]   I can open my phone and go to any Instagram post or go to my DMs, for
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.840]   example, and just, I'll just, I'll do it right now. The first DM I clicked on of
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.760]   the 150 that are here in my phone from yesterday, I just finished chapter two
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.960]   yesterday evening. It's helping me so much. Now I can see myself. I see how my
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.480]   creativity is vital and that it's possible for me to get back to joyfully
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.760]   and playfully letting go of the pressure to make money and help others simply by
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.720]   letting go allows me to get better at my thing. Thank you so much for this book
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.760]   and having shared your journey and your story. I really do hope to meet you one
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.280]   day, probably interviewing you on my soon to be podcast. There are literally, I
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:43.240]   get hundreds every day of people who are putting these very simple things to
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:49.360]   work. I had someone not yesterday, day before yesterday, I use the example of
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.640]   driving home a different way to rewire your brain. If you bring the house to
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.680]   the office, we all tend to travel the same path because we don't have to think
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.960]   about it. We can think about what we're going to cook for dinner or where we're
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.160]   going to go to the movies or who we're going to call that evening. And just the
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:11.760]   simple act of driving home a different way every day, slightly different, it
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.920]   helps you see the wonder in the world and that you truly are not a robot and
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:24.640]   you do have autonomy in 99% of the time you turn left and you turn right. There
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:30.280]   is a recognition and awareness that builds up in you that you can change.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.440]   What you did yesterday does not define who you will be today or certainly not
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.280]   tomorrow.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.560]   Yeah, I already see ways that I could start applying it here. And that's
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:46.160]   pretty exciting. Are there other ways that you can fuel creativity, whether
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.280]   that's diet or exercise or mindfulness?
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:52.960]   Since all the hacks is about all these things like travel, for example, or
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.960]   changing your body composition, for example, you are putting creativity to
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.400]   work when you do that, because you're creating what create a new diet
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.960]   regimen. When you put certain foods in your body, you feel better straight up,
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:13.240]   you give your body the fuel that your individual creature wants. Maybe you're
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.320]   allergic to nuts. So you cut nuts out and crave protein, you're an O positive
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.040]   blood type, and the more protein is better. And like, when you start to feel
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.520]   your individual human with the right kind of food, and you take the right
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:32.080]   kinds out, you only do that through experimenting. And you then create a
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.680]   plan for yourself to what you're going to put in your body. And then you add
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:41.080]   exercise and you go back to your child and you said, God was so fun. I was on
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.960]   the long distance running team when I was in junior high, and I just loved it.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.440]   As a kid, I was very competitive and whatnot. And now as an adult, I'm going
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.160]   to take up running again. And you realize that you're doing all of these
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.720]   things we've talked about so far in the podcast, right? You're looking back to
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.560]   your childhood things that made you happy and healthy. Or you played soccer
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:02.800]   as a kid and you start not as a 42 year old tech executive, you start juggling a
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.080]   soccer ball again in your backyard. Like, I'm telling you that will ignite
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:12.520]   something awesome in you. And it probably will give you one piece of a
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:18.320]   fitness regimen that will, if you insert that into your you're already like, Oh,
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.240]   girl, I'm gonna go to the gym three days a week for an hour, you've infused this
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:26.120]   play. And it's this combination of play the utility of moving in a more dynamic
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:31.720]   way than you do at the gym, that creates a great workout regimen. And if you
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.160]   create a good, you know, food program that you love that has foods that you
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:40.080]   love, and you've experimented through preparing these things, and you create
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.800]   an exercise regimen that engages you that is more than just going to the gym
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.960]   three days and sitting on the Nautilus machines, you are going to create more
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:52.640]   success for yourself, you are, you will be more joyful, and you will pursue both
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.920]   of those things more vigorously than if you did not take intention if you just
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.320]   read some shit on the internet, and then went and did I'm going to do four sets
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.720]   of eight reps of squats, and then I'm going to do that's not an inspired life.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.240]   And the people that you look up to and appreciate and admire, that is not how
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.360]   they are doing it. I promise you, they are taking an active role. And so
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:18.960]   whether this is for changing your body composition, or for traveling to a place
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.840]   that you've, you know, always desired to travel to, like, it's all there for you.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:31.360]   That's the thing. It's like, it's not just about making a work of art. It's
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.320]   about making your life a masterpiece.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.160]   Yeah, yeah, you talked about joyfulness, which I thought was something
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:43.200]   interesting in that last comment. Is there science behind creativity
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.720]   affecting our happiness and our joyfulness in life?
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:54.760]   Absolutely. So if you can disrupt the the typical paradigms, there's, you
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.080]   start to pay attention. And this concept of attention not mean pay attention,
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:04.160]   like as in what your eighth grade math teacher told you, but as attention, the
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.760]   one thing we truly have in this life is where we direct our attention. When you
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.880]   realize that, where you place your attention, are you thinking of yourself
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:18.800]   is lucky or unlucky, as happy or sad as creative or not great, we start deciding
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:25.400]   to direct your attention. The science is very clear. You decide to be happy. And
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:30.560]   then you get breaks at work, and you break through on your diet and your
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.800]   relationship. It's not the other way around. If you wait to be happy until you
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:40.320]   get that break at work, you will largely be waiting forever. So there is a high
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:47.440]   correlation to people's autonomy, and their creativity as connected to their
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:54.360]   life arc to not just happiness, but and joy, but also to fulfillment, which I
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:36:02.320]   think is is very powerful asset. If you feel fulfilled, that is like a it's the
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:07.640]   wind at your back. Life is life happens for you rather than to you. You may not
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.360]   know this, but we share in common is that both of us, I think when we had very
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.040]   little money decided that we were going to travel the world with our then
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:21.400]   girlfriends now wives for multiple months. Yeah, so we did eight months, we
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.440]   spent all almost all of our money. I'm curious what kind of impact you think
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.520]   either that trip specifically or just travel in general has on people's life,
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:37.760]   people's creativity. Wow, I think travel is an incredible gift that you can give
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.080]   yourself for so many reasons. I'll go back to my own personal experience first
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.800]   and then I'll expand it in the particular I think I think it was James
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.760]   Joyce in a particular less universal. So I'll share my experience and maybe you
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:56.680]   can they'll resonate with the listener here. So I mentioned that I was from
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:01.480]   economically. My family didn't have that much money, middle, lower middle class
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:06.040]   status. Dad was a cop. Mom was a secretary. Bless my mom's heart. We I
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.120]   remember she didn't bake cookies because sugar was expensive. That's the kind of
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.600]   household I was raised in. Temperature was 58 degrees. If you're cold, put on a
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:19.720]   sweater. And yet they would save up all of their money. And we had some friends
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:25.800]   who lived abroad and we would visit them every summer. And so I went from the
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:33.320]   middle of my lower middle class suburb, largely white, only hanging around with
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:38.320]   people that looked and talked and walked like me. And then imagine plunking
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:46.640]   yourself down in the middle of London in the early 80s. Mohawks, Piccadilly Circus,
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:54.800]   punk rock that commingled with art and culture. And the same could be true for
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.920]   my parents are travel super freaks. They you know, that's basically all they do
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:03.480]   now is they're in Asia for a month at Russia for a month and they go off the
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:09.200]   place. But despite from being at a very young age, we had very I didn't want for
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.600]   anything. I don't want to misrepresent this. I had Adidas with four stripes and
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:19.080]   like upside down Nike's kind of thing. And yet the experience of going to going
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:25.280]   abroad, spending time in the mountains transformed me because I realized that
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.720]   the world that I came from wasn't all that there is. And when I learned about
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.640]   other cultures through again, things that were engaging to me at the time, punk
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:40.720]   rock music, for example, or cuisine that I remember going to Mexico, for example,
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:46.240]   and the concept of spicy food didn't exist. My mom's very sensitive to spice.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:51.840]   So we had no spice, pepper in my house. And I go to Mexico and you realize, oh,
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:56.520]   so that's a jalapeno. It you think of the spice of life, but it was like very
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.800]   literal for me. And so whether it's cuisine or music or culture, like it is
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:06.640]   so much value in it. And I did not know that about you, Chris. And I'm guessing
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:11.360]   that was that it was part of your courtship and your, your process of
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.720]   falling in love and deciding to make a life together, that there's some that
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.120]   travel has a special place. This is your earlier point about looking back at the
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.360]   things in your life that were valuable or inspirational or whatever to you. And
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.880]   then you can make them come to life in your adult life here with a little bit
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:30.320]   of intention and some, some resources. And I bet that travels special to you.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.000]   Right?
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Yeah, definitely. I mean, one of the things that I think I probably never
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.400]   recognized until this conversation was, you know, I'm the kind of person at work
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.520]   or in life that someone says, Oh, this isn't going to work. It's no, actually,
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:47.720]   let's actually find a different way to do it. Or when something breaks, like a
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.720]   dryer breaks, I'm like, let's just see if we can open it up and figure out how
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:56.400]   to make it work. And we don't have to call someone. And I think that going
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.400]   abroad, traveling different countries, realizing that everyone around the world
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.640]   does so many things in different ways. Like in some countries, people eat
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.120]   dinner at 11pm. In some countries, people take a nap in the afternoon. In
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.640]   some countries, they wake up when the sun rises. Like everyone lives a life
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.200]   that's totally different, which inherently means anything you're doing,
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.240]   whether it's at work, whether it's for your creative passion, whether it's
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.280]   your just your routine at home, there are people that are doing something
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.840]   entirely differently, successfully and happily, such that kind of broadening
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:31.800]   your horizon, whether it's food, culture, just environment, temperature, you
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.760]   know, all kinds of things.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:39.000]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is a
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.200]   great addition to your new year routine. And I am so excited to be partnering

[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:50.480]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.840]   up your cooking at home? If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.680]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more. I'll admit I was a
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.880]   skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave cookware from
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:06.720]   Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.080]   episode. Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:15.600]   food from scratch in the microwave and honestly using it feels like a kitchen
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.280]   cheat code because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much. The
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.480]   cookware is a hundred percent plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:29.920]   reheat all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.880]   too. And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:39.540]   highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice. It is so good. And if you haven't
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:43.400]   checked out the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last year, you

[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:01.640]   I just want to thank you Quick for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:17.520]   So please consider supporting those who support us. I think I have this
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:22.560]   perspective now that I didn't realize I had and had applied to work and life.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:26.720]   Anything can be done in any number of ways and there's probably a more optimal
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.120]   way. And part of the reason I probably love to optimize is that I've seen that
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:35.320]   there are other ways to do things. So I refuse to believe that the status quo is
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:41.120]   the best we've got. And I now attribute that, unknowingly before, but to seeing
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:46.040]   how so many different people live so many different ways. I think that's part
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:52.640]   of the magic, the richness, and the depth of a life well-lived. And to be crystal,
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:59.080]   like, if you cannot afford to go to, I just used the example of London because
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.880]   it's something we did as a kid, you don't have to travel tens of thousands of
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:09.840]   miles on expensive airplanes and stay at fancy hotels. Like, literally going into
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:14.320]   the woods and you'll find that you need a different set of skills, that people do
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:20.640]   live differently. Whether it's somewhere in your backyard or across the planet,
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.960]   this exposure to different ways of living, this is part of what I am
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.640]   encouraging people to do. It's not dissimilar to going driving home a
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:34.760]   different way every day of the week because it reminds you that there are so
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.080]   many other things outside of your routine. And right now, there's someone
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.600]   who's saying, "Oh my gosh, I got two kids under four," and it's like, whatever the...
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:47.440]   Hey look, I'm not saying that's not a reality for you. I'm saying that I know
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:54.960]   there is space in your life to do something differently that will remind
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:01.280]   you and reconnect you with the authority, your own personal authenticity to pursue,
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:08.760]   to move in the direction, however fast or slow, of the life of your dreams. And part
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:13.280]   of the way you build dreams, part of what our culture has really whiffed on the
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.040]   last two decades, is the imagined part of my creative process. Part of what
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:23.160]   traveling does is helps you imagine you want for yourself in this life, right?
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.200]   Maybe, I used the example earlier of going to Copenhagen. Maybe you're inspired
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.240]   by the architecture and the simplicity, and so that you want to bring that
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:36.440]   experience of what it felt like to live in that architecture back because you're
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.760]   gonna build a home for yourself one day, and you've experienced what it feels
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.720]   like to live in a really well-designed place, and you want to then bring that
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:46.280]   back for yourself here in the States or wherever you live.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:51.000]   Yeah, and if anyone's listening to this podcast, there's a dozen episodes about,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.320]   you know, how to travel for free and credit card points and miles. We were
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:59.640]   fortunate that this group is exposed to many ways to make a trip to Europe cost
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.960]   almost nothing, a trip to Africa cost almost nothing. There's a handful of
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.600]   sign-up bonuses that make that even possible. It's so true, man.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:13.000]   I'm glad, I'm fortunate for you, and I'm grateful for you and your show for
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.320]   helping people live a richer life through a variety of hacks, whether
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:23.440]   that's travel or, in this case, it's one part psychology, two parts taking action to
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:28.880]   hack, I think, culture. And as soon as you do this stuff, this is the
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.400]   cool thing, as soon as you do it once, you're like looking around, you're like, "I feel like
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:36.760]   you just got away with something." Like, "What? I have my own podcast now? Or I'm going to
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:43.600]   Africa for $1,800 for two weeks? Like, how is this possible?" And there's
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.080]   something unlocks in you, and you realize this world of possibility, and then you
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:52.200]   can lift and stamp that world of possibility onto other things. It's this
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.040]   beautiful, virtuous cycle.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:47:02.320]   Yeah, I think there's a good segue to ask you, "Are there things you do in your daily routine that other people
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:06.720]   might benefit from adopting or trying that might fall in the category of
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.760]   kind of life hacks or anything like that?"
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:13.120]   Sure, at the risk of sounding cliche, because even the concept of a morning
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.840]   routine wasn't really popular on the internet 10 years ago, and here we are,
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.800]   everyone's talking about it, but I would underscore that there's a reason for
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:24.640]   that, because starting owning the morning and/or some sort of a routine will help
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:30.960]   you own the day. And having a routine and having an element of your routine being
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:36.440]   to break your routine, to me, that is the life hack that is most
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:44.440]   unrecognized, unrealized, and under-planned for. I live the things
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.400]   that I'm talking about here, like driving home a different way, or listening to
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:52.120]   some different music, or trying to learn new things from friends who are experts
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:57.800]   in the world of fill-in-the-blank, if I have some benign or newfound curiosity
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:02.680]   to it. So I think that's the big takeaway, is what can you do to provide space in
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.800]   your routine to do things differently, whether that's an extra half an hour to
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.360]   cook dinner, or we've talked about carving out some time to travel to a
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.160]   faraway distant place that does things very different than we do, or driving
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.660]   home a different way, or pursuing a hobby that is something creative such that you
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:22.640]   can rewire your brain and apply more creativity in your life. Make space for
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:26.880]   all that stuff, because it is critical. That is what most people who are
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:31.520]   successful and fulfilled have a routine that allows for these things. And it's
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.520]   not, you know, you hear like, "Oh, I eat 30 grams of protein when I wake up."
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:40.240]   True. But again, you deconstruct the most successful and fulfilled people, and
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:46.520]   they make time for the stuff that I'm talking about, for creativity. Now, I do
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:51.600]   want to endorse cold water therapy, specifically because I've been a
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:56.320]   practitioner for about 10 years, started off with cold showers, and then I would
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:02.600]   go to spas or gyms or specific places that had cold water that I could get
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:08.400]   into for long durations of time. And then it went to me having my own cold
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.960]   plunge at my house in Seattle, and then I'm right here up at our little beach
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:17.680]   house, and I'm 100 feet from the Puget Sound, which right now is 49 degrees, 48
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.800]   degrees in that water. So I am a huge advocate of cold water. If you haven't
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:27.160]   had Wim Hof on the show, he's, you know, written a bunch of books. He's been on
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:32.080]   my podcast, The Chase Jarvis Live Show. You can easily search and read the
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:36.120]   benefits of cold water exposure. It is better than coffee, great for your immune
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:42.320]   system, and very good for personal mindset psychology. It is interesting to
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:48.480]   every day get into very cold water, despite never wanting to. So your ability
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.680]   to willingly make yourself uncomfortable for a short amount of time every day,
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:57.200]   turns out it's pretty valuable. Funny enough, we have a hot tub in our
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:01.320]   home, and that hot tub, we stopped using it for a few months, so I drained it. I
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.560]   filled it back up. Pump doesn't work. Looked outside last night, it's in the
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.240]   40s. I was like, "Oh, I got a cold plunge. Pump doesn't work. Can't get the hot tub
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.080]   working." So I was telling my wife, I was like, "Hey, I guess now we have a cold
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:16.720]   plunge until someone replaces this pump." Which, by the way, is something I'm
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:21.680]   creatively trying to figure out how to fix, but until then, we have that. One
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:26.380]   thing, when it comes to creativity, one of the things that I know I face a lot,
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:30.280]   that I want to touch on before we go, getting in, everyone knows that awesome
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:34.200]   zone flow state, but what about when you're stuck? Do you have any tips for
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.960]   people that are sitting there trying to be creative on something, whether it's
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:42.480]   writing, wet working, anything, and they hit that creative block? How do you get
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:52.640]   past that and move forward? Play. Play is an incredibly powerful lever. Go goof
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:57.960]   off. Go do something that brings you a ton of joy that is ideally not at all
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:01.720]   related to the thing, to the problem you're trying to solve. Creativity
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:06.160]   happens, again, it's this virtuous cycle. You try it, you get a little more
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:10.440]   courage. You try it some more, you get a little courage. It's like there's so
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:15.200]   many virtuous cycles, or positive feedback loops, or leverage that we can
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:19.600]   get from these things, and this relationship between joy and play is a
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:24.160]   very strong one. Let's just take your hot tub pump, for example. If you
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:28.000]   set a deadline and you need to have it fixed by Friday, and you literally sit
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.200]   there in front of the thing, there will be times on Wednesday at noon when you've
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.680]   been trying to fix it, and you can't fix it. You're like, "I need to stop staring at
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.880]   this pump because I'm thinking in loops, and I'm not
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:45.240]   unlocking anything here." And so you go hit a bucket of golf balls, or go get in
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:49.240]   your cold plunge, or go do something that brings you a lot of joy, and you sit down
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.640]   at that problem again, and the problem looks differently. This is, again,
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:59.040]   programming your body with powerful neurochemistry, a little bit this sort of
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:04.440]   work-hard-rest cycle that we know is good for the human body, and the human
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.640]   body appreciates things like sleep and good nutrition. There's a list in my book
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:12.120]   "Creative Calling" about creativity boosters and zappers, and there are some
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:17.600]   very simple physical things like going out and play. This is why I love to look
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:22.120]   back into our childhood and think of the things that brought us a ton of joy.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.200]   There's a guy who used to work for Tim named Charlie Hone. I don't know if you
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.520]   remember Charlie. He wrote a book called "Play It Away," which is a really
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:32.200]   interesting book that he wrote, which is specifically around playing to reduce
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:37.320]   anxiety. And one of the things, it's just a simple exercise that I took out of his
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:41.560]   book as an example here for your listeners. He brought himself like a
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:47.600]   hundred baseballs, and he and a buddy go to a park, and a buddy slow pitches, and
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:51.760]   they just take turns whacking these balls all over the baseball field. Then
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:55.640]   they go pick them up, and he said in 30 minutes, each of you hit a
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:59.120]   hundred baseballs. You walked around, you got outside, and because he loved playing
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:03.720]   baseball and hitting balls as a kid in the batting cages, he said it just
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:07.920]   completely transforms his headspace. And then he goes back to whatever the
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:13.620]   problem at hand is, and he's refreshed and invigorated. And so, you know, I like
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:21.400]   to think of, I think those things, specifically playing, are very helpful,
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:27.800]   and they help in a myriad of ways. It's like a panacea for inaction, and we've
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:33.420]   lost that in the same way that we've largely lost our imagination. And we have
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:38.000]   to do actually active work to get it back. So, I think play is very valuable.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.520]   And I will put an asterisk by this, which is, if you're sitting in front of a
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.800]   problem, and you're, let's just say you're a professional creator, you're a
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:51.600]   copywriter, or a designer, or something, you are paid to create on demand. And that
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:57.480]   actually comes through discipline, right? That comes through, people say, "Oh, I just
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:01.960]   have a blank page here, and I'm stuck. I can't write anything." Why don't you write
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:06.360]   500 shitty words? "Show me your best stuff." And then a photographer will say,
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.360]   "Oh, no, I'll show you this." And it's just, "I don't want to show you, because I'm not
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:14.560]   really proud of my work." "Okay, then show me your worst stuff." "Show me my worst
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.680]   stuff?" "Yeah, just show me something, because the something means that you're
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:22.680]   working, that you're..." I think Chuck Close said, "Inspiration is for
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:27.720]   amateurs. The rest of us sit down, and we get to work." So, I like the mix of
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:33.160]   like, tough love and wild inspiration. The tough love is, sit down at a certain
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.580]   time, and do this work every day, even if you don't feel like it. And, if you're
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:42.720]   just doing that, and you're not inspired, doing things that bring joy, and play, and
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:48.000]   laughter, going to a stand-up comedy, hitting baseballs, taking up running
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.880]   again, these things that will bring you joy, that are from your past, this
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.620]   combination of those two things, of sitting in front of the page, and doing
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:55:00.400]   the work anyway, and taking breaks, this is a very powerful comedy. Yeah, I think
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:04.640]   this is actually a great place to wrap up, because everyone here can hopefully
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:08.160]   take some time in the rest of their day, and go play a little, and get
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.880]   inspired. But, obviously, I think everyone needs to check out this book. I really
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:15.960]   enjoyed it. Link to that in the show notes. I think it's creativecalling.com
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:21.080]   is also the book's website. Yep. Yep. Where else can people find out what
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:25.640]   you're up to? I'm at Chase Jarvis everywhere on the internet, Instagram,
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:31.880]   YouTube, Twitter, whatnot. And, I would also steer people to creativelive.com,
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:37.640]   which is, we've built a learning platform specifically for creators and
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:43.000]   entrepreneurs. So, it is, whether you are just dabbling, and you want to learn
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.720]   skills from someone who is the best in the world, there are people who are
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:53.520]   literally Pulitzer Prize winners, the highest performers in every category,
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:58.720]   from photography, design, filmmaking, entrepreneurship, you can learn from
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:02.040]   these people there. So, whether you're trying to pick up new skills, or going
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:06.320]   for inspiration, specifically creative inspiration, there's more than 2,000
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:11.720]   classes there for an annual subscription price of 150 bucks, or something, 149
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:15.920]   bucks. That's another destination there on the internet. Yeah, when I worked at
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:19.360]   Google Ventures, we were investors, got a chance to take a few courses. They're
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:24.040]   fantastic. Chase, thank you so much for being here. Chris, thanks for doing the
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.560]   show. All the Hacks is a really fun place. It's a fun destination out there in the
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:33.840]   internet media universe. Congrats on making a successful show. And I'll say it
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:38.840]   slightly differently, congrats on creating an amazing show that a lot of
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.920]   people benefit from. Keep doing it. Yeah, thank you.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.760]   That was amazing. Thank you so much for listening. Recognizing my creativity in
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.520]   the middle of this conversation feels like a big unlock. And I'm excited to see
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:56.440]   how that affects my ability to be creative with the rest of my life. Also,
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:00.080]   I'm really grateful for all the amazing questions you've been sending. And I'll
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:04.920]   be doing a Q&A episode to answer all of them, actually a few episodes. So please
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:08.560]   keep them coming as I genuinely love hearing from you and would love to be
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:12.560]   able to help you all continue to upgrade your lives. You can send anything my way,
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:17.560]   even if you just want to say hi, by emailing chris@allthehacks.com. That's it
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:18.920]   for now. See you next time.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:37.120]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.640]   money. That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:45.000]   retirement. It's called the personal finance podcast, and it's much more about
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.400]   building generational wealth and spending your money on the things you
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.960]   value than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar. It's hosted by my good
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:56.800]   friend Andrew who truly believes that everyone in this world can build wealth
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:01.520]   and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining. I know
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:06.320]   because I was a guest on the show in December 2022. But recently I listened to
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:10.760]   an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind. And it
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:15.440]   was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:19.680]   their employer's retirement plan. And that's just one of the many fascinating
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.760]   stats he shared. The personal finance podcast has something for everyone. It's
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:27.400]   filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:31.680]   money and grow your wealth. So I highly recommend you check it out. Just search
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:35.840]   for the personal finance podcast on Apple podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.760]   listen to podcasts and enjoy.
