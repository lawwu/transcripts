[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:10.720]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.600]   about upgrading your life, money and travel all while spending
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.600]   less and saving more. I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.060]   have you on my journey to optimize my life. First off, I'm
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.160]   so grateful for all the questions you've been sending
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.520]   in. And I'll be releasing a Q&A episode soon, starting with a
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.000]   ton of great content on credit cards, points and miles. But
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.680]   today we're talking to Chase Jarvis. And while you might not
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.160]   know him by name, I am sure you've seen his work. He's one
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.360]   of the most influential and award winning photographers
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.440]   creating hundreds of campaigns for companies like Nike, Apple,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.320]   Samsung, Google and Red Bull. He's written two best selling
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.040]   photography books and was a contributor to the Pulitzer
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.720]   Prize winning New York Times story Snowfall. And if that's
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.280]   not enough, he is also a successful entrepreneur. In
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.000]   2009, he launched the best camera app, earning app of the
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.160]   year, letting you share images directly to social networks. And
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.960]   the app is widely credited with kicking off the photo sharing
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.240]   craze. The next year, he founded Creative Live, which was just
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.160]   acquired by Fiverr last month, and is one of the world's
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.800]   largest live streaming education companies. So today, we're
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.120]   going to be talking about creativity. Now, if you hear
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.440]   that and think, oh, that's not for me, I don't paint or do
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.640]   anything creative, we might be cut from the same cloth. Because
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.280]   that is exactly the reaction I had when I started thinking
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.160]   about this conversation. But as I started doing my homework, I
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.200]   realized I couldn't have been more wrong. Part of that
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.400]   homework was reading Chase's new best selling book, Creative
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.480]   Calling, establish a daily practice, infuse your world with
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.840]   meaning and succeed in work and life. It was a fantastic read
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.320]   that really opened up my eyes to how I could optimize and upgrade
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.480]   my own life through creativity and creative practices. I am
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.120]   incredibly honored and excited to be chatting with Chase
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.600]   Jarvis. So let's jump in. Chase, thanks for being here.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.320]   Thanks for saying those nice things about me, Chris.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.640]   Yeah, it's always good to flatter someone before you're
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.840]   gonna interrogate about all kinds of things.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.800]   It's oh, oh, stop, stop.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.820]   Yeah. So I would say you have quite an intimidating creative
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.040]   background. Were you born into this journey? Or how did it all
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.080]   come about? Were you always this kind of creative icon in your
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.720]   peer group?
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.660]   Interesting. I'll start with a short story. And it goes back to
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.360]   second grade. Okay. So my teacher, actually, it's going to
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.960]   go to first grade, the summer between first and second, I made
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.440]   my first film, me and a couple of buddies in the neighborhood,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.320]   we washed a bunch of cars and did some yard work to get enough
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.840]   money to buy two rolls of Super 8 film. And then we hired my
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.920]   buddy's brother, Derek for $1 to be our cinematographer, we
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.800]   scripted, made our costumes. And it was called the Sons of Zorro.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.560]   It was a blockbuster. The funny thing is, in addition to making
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.640]   the film, there was a business aspect of it, right? We had to
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.920]   pay all that lay all this money out to make the film. And then
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.640]   we went and bought a bunch of concessions, we put flyers up
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.880]   all over the neighborhood, we screened the film to a sold out
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.040]   audience. And we actually made a profit on our first film. And
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.440]   I again, this was the summer routine first and second grade.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.960]   So I'm rolling into second grade thinking I'm the shit, right?
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.400]   Moviemaker, this is going to be cool. And I had a little magic
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.800]   act that I had going on. I had a little stand up comedy routine.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.760]   And second grade kicks off and I'm loving it. And that's right
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.360]   before the holiday break. So we're recording this around
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.160]   Thanksgiving time here in the US in 2021. So it was roughly the
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.600]   same time of year, take me back second grade. Before the holiday
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.880]   break, there's this thing called the ice cream social. And the
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.920]   student, their parents teacher conferences. So I'm at school
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.680]   after the day is done, and the parents show up and I'm eating
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.560]   ice cream with friends running around the halls. And I dug in
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.600]   just to hear just in time to hear my second grade teacher,
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.280]   Miss Kelly, tell my parents that Chase is so much better at
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.280]   sports than he is at art. And I'm like, Okay, and right now,
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.920]   if you're driving your car, listen to this podcast, like, Oh,
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.760]   poor little chase, you know, actually, I didn't, it wasn't
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.120]   poor little chase. It was like, Oh, okay, that was a piece of
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.400]   programming that I took and said, Okay, great, I'm gonna pay
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.880]   more attention to the thing that the teacher thinks I'm good at,
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.200]   because whether we like it or not, we're social animals, we
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.960]   all can get acceptance. And we want to lean into those things
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.000]   where other people find virtue and value in us and steer away
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.480]   from those that where we are, say, less encouraged. And so
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.360]   started my creative journey. Fast forward, I ended up going
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.080]   to college on a soccer scholarship, I played soccer and
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.280]   football could have played either could have gone on to
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.520]   soccer professionally. And at some point, I'm recognizing that
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.120]   there's this side of myself that I have been denying for since
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.400]   largely second grade, and I didn't build an identity around
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.320]   being a creator, although I was a skate punk, and we enjoyed
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.720]   building our own skate ramps and punk rock music and spray
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.360]   painting and all that kind of stuff. So there was all kinds of
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.160]   creative activities, but my identity was wrapped up in the
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.920]   thing that the adults in my life wanted for me and my parents,
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.040]   career counselors, grandparents, teachers, these
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.400]   people that we largely respect and admire, were steering me to
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.560]   do to stay focused on sports. I was fine academically, I was
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.760]   solid. But my punchline here is you open the show with
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.600]   questioning whether or not you had a creative sort of identity
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.320]   or you're aware of the creativity that resides within
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.200]   you, and that you create something every day, all day
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.600]   long, you're a creative machine, Chris. And I had that same
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.800]   experience, right? Creativity is something that's trained out of
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   us, not trained into us. The cool thing about it is it's a
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.840]   flame inside us that never goes out. And I believe I wrote the
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.920]   book Creative Calling, I started Creative Live and all these
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.360]   creative apps. And basically everything in my entrepreneurial
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.480]   and creative journey has been around trying to cultivate this,
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.880]   understand it better, and share it with others. So the short
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.520]   answer to your question is, no, I was not raised in a world. My
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.640]   dad was a cop, my mom was a secretary at a biotech company.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.640]   It wasn't thought of as critical for my upbringing. And yet, when
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.920]   I looked around at what is creativity and how valuable
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.840]   could it be? I, like so many people who you identified
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.760]   yourself as one of these people in the intro, were unclear about
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.600]   what that even means and the value that represents in the
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.840]   world. So no, it wasn't in my background. Yes, I think it's
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.440]   the most important and urgent thing we can do is understand
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.200]   and acknowledge our personal creative journey.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.800]   It's funny, what one of the things in your story that you
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.320]   shared rung similar to me, which was about making movies. So I
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.320]   remember, I read this book, Rodamante's Revenge, it was like
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.240]   a 75 page sci fi book. And so for a project, a friend of mine,
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.200]   I made a movie, and we submitted it as a school project. And I
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.680]   think back to all the boxes my parents kept of things as a kid,
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.520]   I was all with drawings and all that stuff. As a child, we were
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.440]   so much more creative. We were drawing, playing make believe. I
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.160]   went to my neighbor's house the other day, and there's all these
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   kids that made up a game in the backyard where they draw things
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.400]   and hide them. Are we less creative as we're older? What is
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.960]   that journey like? Because it feels like it was so much
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.680]   stronger and part of our identity as children. And it
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.120]   somehow and maybe you know why, but somehow it waned as we got
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.520]   older.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.680]   There's science here at work. And then I can also share, I
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.920]   believe that almost everyone's empirical experience, at least
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.080]   if it doesn't echo this sentiment, it's present
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.400]   somewhere in your past. If you stand up in front of any first
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.960]   grade classroom, second grade classroom, say, who wants to go
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.560]   up to the front and draw me a picture? Every single hand goes
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.360]   up. Every single hand. There's not judgment around. Oh, cool. I
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.640]   want to draw. Does anybody here not want to draw or play a game
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.600]   or create a story together? Everyone says yes, at, you know,
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.960]   first, second grade, then you go to fifth, sixth grade, and it's
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.080]   a third of the hands and you go to high school and it's two
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.200]   hands out of 30. And this is what I mean. And I do believe
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.560]   this is changing. So I want to put a pin in this, we can
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.560]   revisit it later. But ultimately, we are emerging from
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.200]   a time, thankfully, we're leaving a time period where the
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.000]   concept of creativity was seen as optional. I think of what our
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.240]   parents and our parents' parents were coming out of the
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.960]   industrial revolution, factories, the education system
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.720]   was based largely on the factory, like you put all the
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.440]   kids and the widgets in one end, you put them through this black
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.960]   box, everybody learns the same thing at the same time in the
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.000]   same way. And then they come out the other end. That, first of
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.160]   all, is not how human beings learn, we all learn differently
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.200]   through different modalities. And, and so it's easy to see why
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.560]   this thing that is very intangible, very difficult to
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.440]   describe, we know it's valuable, but you can see how those things
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.600]   end up on the cutting room floor of a system that values
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.080]   homogeneity and simplicity and mass production, much like a
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.480]   factory. So it's not easy, or it's not hard, it's not a
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:37.800]   stretch, rather, to understand why we are in this situation and
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.320]   why you notice that your friends and friends' kids are joyful and
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.840]   playing and creating like, crazy imaginative stuff. And yet here
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.240]   we are like, okay, I got to pay the bills got to do this, my
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.560]   spreadsheet is up to is it, you're looking at a spreadsheet
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.840]   right now of all the things I need to talk to Chase about. And
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.840]   it's just important for us to be aware, like we can respond to
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.960]   things if we are aware that they have that has happened. So
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.520]   anyone who's listening right now who hasn't, doesn't identify as
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.000]   a creative person or a creator, let's just put a pin in that
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.560]   too, because we're gonna come back, I'm gonna beat you over
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.320]   the head with the fact that absolutely you are creative,
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.000]   that Chris, you and I are co creating this conversation right
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.280]   now, if you just started screaming in your microphone, it
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.360]   would dramatically change the trajectory of our conversation
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.800]   because they're like a specific definition you use to define
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.520]   creativity.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.720]   Yeah, creativity, the way that I think about it and talk about
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.760]   it in my book, it's a very, it's a widely accepted definition.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.520]   It's just taking two or more things and combining them in an
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.920]   unlikely and ideally useful way. So there's an element of
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.240]   utility there, even painting can be the utility of painting is
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.280]   to make you feel an emotion or making a film, for example, is
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.120]   to understand a story or narrative and connect with that
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   narrative. And, you know, it helps you see that science is
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.920]   wildly creative computer coding wildly creative, the light that
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.520]   we all take for granted right now, right, that's just
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.360]   electrical engineering plus creativity, it took Einstein
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.400]   however many 10,000 experiments gone wrong in order to create
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.240]   the light bulb, we even use the word create the light bulb, and
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.880]   we think of that as hard science. So once you start to
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.600]   see that you're just combining things in new and interesting
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.840]   ways to make you useful stuff, it's start you start to realize
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.640]   that creativity is all around us.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.840]   Looking back now on different things in my life and saying,
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.120]   Oh, there was creativity there. My friend and I both had
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.280]   children around the same time, what device can we create to
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.600]   feed a bottle to a baby without having to hold it? And we were
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.200]   like, Oh, if you take a gallon sized Ziploc, and you fill it
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.720]   half with air, it's like the perfect pillow and cradle for a
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   bottle. And and now talking to you, I'm like, that was
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.040]   probably a really creative moment. Whereas in the time I
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.280]   was like, just I'm solving a problem. It doesn't feel like
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.920]   creativity.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.240]   That's the cool thing about creativity. Again, this scale is
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.440]   really where I'm trying to focus people's attention. Because if
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.080]   you can, it is not a stretch, it is not a logic, it is not
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.200]   illogical or not a logical fallacy that if creativity is
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.800]   defined by combining, you know, two or more things in, you know,
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.320]   new and useful ways, ideally useful, then like, wow, okay, if
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.440]   you can identify or agree with that, that's a pretty easy step
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.480]   to recognize that what you just did with that bottle was even
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.040]   called it an invention, you're inventing. We use words like
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.320]   innovation all the time. But what is innovation if it's not
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.880]   creativity applied? So it's a pretty simple framework, a
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.120]   pretty simple argument for someone to buy into. And for
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.680]   those of you who are identify as creative, and listen to show
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.200]   great, I don't need to bring you along. But for the doubters,
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   hopefully the first nine minutes here, as it will at least get
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.320]   you to understand to listen to the next nine minutes and listen
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.640]   for the the further rationale that this is a superpower.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.920]   I'm now accepting that creativity is something that
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.160]   happens all the time, whether I'm tweaking a recipe at dinner,
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.880]   or creating a bottle holder. And now what now I've accepted I'm
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.880]   creative. And you've talked in the book about how creativity is
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.480]   something that's wildly important and as essential to
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.400]   health and well being as exercise and nutrition and
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.120]   mindfulness. So how do I use this newfound knowledge that I'm
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.440]   creative to benefit myself to feel better to be happier?
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.480]   I'll give you the vague concept first, and then I'll give you a
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.440]   very actionable approach. And for some people, the vague
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.880]   notion is enough for them to grab onto it and put it to use
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.720]   and others may need something a little more structured. So we'll
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.600]   cover both. The first and more conceptual approach is, okay, if
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   you acknowledge that creativity is all around you, what you
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.800]   really are doing is, sweet, I have the ability to shape my
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.200]   environment, right, I'm choosing the things that I will expose
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:18.480]   myself to, I will craft a morning routine, I will curate
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.320]   and cultivate the kinds of things that I let into my world.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.920]   Those are people, those are those are ideas. And what you're
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.880]   doing is you're creating a framework for you to then go on
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.840]   and be able to live the life you want. And again, for most people,
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.880]   you're like, oh, okay, I buy that I buy it. And that's part
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.280]   of what I want. There's a part in the book where I talk about
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.120]   yes, this book is if you are identified as a creator, this
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.960]   will supercharge your photography, your design, your
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.920]   entrepreneurship. But really, this is a book about life and
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.600]   how to live it. And, and this is the place where I want to get
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.360]   people because then, you know, moving freely between cooking a
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.640]   meal and tweaking a recipe to use your example and designing a
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.360]   career arc for yourself. What do I want to do next? If I can, we
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.840]   have to spend our time some way we all have to make money. Why
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.960]   don't I do something that I love and make my not just make a
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.360]   masterpiece, but make a masterpiece of my life. To me,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.800]   that's a much more interesting life lived. And again, the
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.320]   people that you look up to respected admire, they did not
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.360]   get that life on accident, they created it very intentionally.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.200]   Because if you do not continue creating it, if you stop, then
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.780]   you will if you don't write your own script, somebody else will
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.420]   certainly write it for you. So let's just say that I'm guessing
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.100]   that I got three quarters of the listeners to say, okay, cool,
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:42.940]   I'm down with that.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.220]   If I recap that, in my own words to try to bring it to life, by
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.660]   recognizing that I'm a creator, I'm doing creative things,
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.780]   whether it's food or at work or with my family, I'm now
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.900]   realizing that, wow, I actually have the ability to create
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.740]   things in life. And I can apply that same lesson to what many
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.620]   people think of as, well, I need this job, and I need to do this
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.740]   thing. And this is how the day works. And I have to do this
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.860]   thing, I can now apply these creative lessons to how I can
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.660]   structure my day, how I can structure my career, how I can
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:19.140]   structure my life where I live. And that the same muscles that I
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.020]   would use to do that can be improved and strengthened by
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.580]   these other creative acts. So if cooking more and being more
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.100]   experimental, I'm strengthening the same muscle that I would use
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.180]   to plan my day and life.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.380]   You are 100% correct. And the science is very clear here.
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.780]   Everyone on your show is probably aware in some way,
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.300]   shape or form of neuroplasticity. This is what
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.180]   you are doing when you are picking up that hobby that you
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.020]   gave up when you were in seventh grade, because playing the
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.500]   guitar wasn't cool at that time or something. What you are doing
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.140]   when you reengage with that, and when you drive home a different
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:58.140]   way from work every day, or you actively are changing the recipe
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.380]   for the meal you're cooking for your family, your friend, your
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.700]   girlfriend, wife, you know, husband, partner, whatever, that
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:10.060]   literally rewires your brain to new possibilities. Because if
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.460]   you do not do those things, then your those paths in your brain
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.980]   get, they're like grooves, right in pavement, they become ever
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.980]   deepened. And that lack of ability to escape those grooves,
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.300]   that is where monotony and a lack of innovation, a lack of a
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.380]   dynamic environment, actually, I think undermines the human
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.460]   spirit, it undermines the things that you say, gosh, I wish I
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:40.300]   could do x or y or z. So one, not changing all of those things
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.140]   and putting this to work in the way that you talked about it. Not
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.700]   only does it is it not make possibilities more possible, but
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:54.420]   it actually actively undermines those things. So yes, 100%. Now
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.860]   I think we got three quarters of the listeners coming along with
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.100]   us at this point for the one quarter who's okay, I need
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.420]   something more concrete. There you may have, or you may have
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.940]   heard of or be aware of the concept called the create a
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.780]   practice, like our process, what is a create the creative process,
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.820]   I have a very simple than the book is actually divided into
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.620]   four sections that this is a process that will work for a
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.700]   drawing that you want to make it your desk for a book or for your
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:30.900]   life. Four simple steps, and the acronym is idea, I d e a. And
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.180]   this is a four step process that you can look at the creation of
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:41.100]   anything and say it went through these four processes. And when
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.260]   you are aware, it's again, like so many things, the awareness
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.340]   that this is happening, and your ability to then focus on these
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.140]   as steps can actually, the increased awareness and focus
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:56.460]   will enhance your ability to do it more regularly with more
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:02.580]   consistency. And I would argue more successfully. So I stands
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.380]   for this is imagine what's possible before you create
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.060]   something, you have to say, what I want to create in this world
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.140]   before you started this podcast, what I want to do, I don't want
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.780]   to write a book, do I want to chisel some concrete slabs and
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.180]   make a tablet? No, I want to create a podcast. So you
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.860]   imagined what was possible, then you have to very simply design a
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.620]   plan. This is just like building a house, right? You don't just
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.460]   start hammering shit together. Imagine what you want to do
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:34.420]   design a plan, execute that plan. And then the A is what is
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.740]   the most commonly misunderstood, but one of the most important is
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:45.780]   we need to amplify this outcome. And by amplify, create an
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.860]   audience for this thing, whether that's internal or external,
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.700]   whether that is, you just need to put it out into the world,
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.100]   you need to share this because that is a very valuable feedback
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.780]   loop that will help you refine your creative endeavor, whatever
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.060]   the thing that you set out to create was. So once again,
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.900]   imagine, design, execute and amplify four very simple steps
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.420]   that if you do not know where to get started, do this with
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.660]   anything, you can do it right now, I want to draw a picture,
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.740]   what I want to draw, I want to draw a monkey. All right, I'm
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.900]   going to design how the monkey is going to look, it's going to
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.500]   be hanging from a tree, I'm going to make some funny circles
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.460]   on a page, I executed that plan. And then if I like what I, and
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.340]   then I'm going to show my partner, and they're going to
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.940]   laugh at me, and I'm going to get some feedback and go back
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.420]   and maybe refine it. But the point is, this is a simple for
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.180]   for this is literally how creativity works. If you care,
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.620]   most people don't care because they get concept one that we
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.780]   spent a little more time talking about. If you don't get that,
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.380]   or if you want to make this a very repeatable process, and you
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.820]   want to have a more scientific approach, if you're a, a
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.100]   scientist by trade or computer programmer, this may help.
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:21:00.180]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be. I get
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.020]   it, life comes at you fast. But trust me, your friends are
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:08.500]   probably desperate for a good hang. So kick 2024 off right by
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.900]   finally hosting that event. Just make sure you do it the easy
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.620]   way and let our sponsor Drizly, the go-to app for drink
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.620]   delivery, take care of the supplies. All you need to come
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.540]   up with is the excuse to get together. It doesn't even have
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.260]   to be a good one. It could be your dog's birthday, that the
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.540]   sun finally came out, or maybe you just want to celebrate that
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.660]   you got through another week. With Drizly, you can make
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.340]   hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list, which
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.940]   means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.300]   without ever leaving yours. And since I know you like a good
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.620]   deal, Drizly compares prices on their massive selection of beer,
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.100]   wine and spirits across multiple stores. So when I really wanted
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.940]   to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week,
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.180]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.020]   hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.740]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app or go to
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:07.420]   drizly.com. That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today. Must be 21 plus
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.340]   not available in all locations.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.140]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.900]   life, money, and so much more. But sometimes it's helpful to
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.020]   talk to other people in your situation, which actually gets
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.140]   harder as you build your wealth. So I want to introduce you to
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.980]   today's sponsor, Long Angle. Long Angle is a community of high
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.460]   net worth individuals with backgrounds in everything from
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.660]   technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.820]   manufacturing, and more. I'm a member of Long Angle. I've loved
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.220]   being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.580]   founders, Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.780]   to talk about alternative investments. Now, the majority
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.900]   of Long Angle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.100]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.060]   knowledge and learn from each other in a confidential,
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.900]   unbiased setting. On top of that, members also get access
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.580]   to some unique private market investment opportunities. Like I
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.300]   said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.940]   community because you're getting advice and feedback from
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.300]   people in a similar situation to you on everything from your
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.660]   investment portfolio, to your children's education, to finding
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.100]   a concierge doctor. So many of these conversations aren't
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.860]   happening anywhere else online. So if you have more than 2.2
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.580]   million in investable assets, which is their minimum for
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.180]   membership, I encourage you to check out Long Angle, and it's
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:33.980]   totally free to join. Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.020]   and if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:45.260]   about it here. Again, that's longangle.com. So how important
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.900]   when exercising our creative muscles is it to maybe go deep
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.460]   versus wide? So, for example, I'm kind of like conversational
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.180]   in French, but I could probably be fluent. And so I could go
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.780]   really deep on one thing, or I could go pretty wide and go
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.260]   read a book on something totally new, like the history
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.940]   of manufacturing in the U.S., which is a wild, interesting
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.340]   thing to learn about, probably really sparks some creative
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:13.260]   thoughts. How do you think about exercising deep in a
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.900]   practice, whether it's the guitar or cooking or something
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.660]   versus adding new things to your arsenal of learning and
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.100]   creativity? This is an interesting question, and it's
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.300]   interesting for me on a couple different axes. I'm going to
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.220]   try and go with the first and most obvious, which it depends
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.900]   on what your goals are. I believe, you know, there's a
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:39.340]   section in the book on mastery, and it's my personal belief
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.420]   having mastered photography. I've been named master of a
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.100]   bunch of different areas of photography by those groups that
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.580]   do such things. And so, and I also, I'm aware of my mastery
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.740]   of photography. It shows up in my resume and my bio and all
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.580]   that stuff. But one of the things that I love about going
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:03.980]   deep, and this is true about anything, about going deep on
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:08.540]   any subject, is first of all, you tend to only go deep on
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.700]   something you love because that's what you're willing to
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:16.860]   do. And whether that is birding or mechanical engineering or
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:24.460]   podcasting or photography, design, you name it, going deep
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.620]   on something and allowing yourself to, let's just for the
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.540]   most simple definition of mastery, let's say you've got
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.660]   10,000 hours, you know your way around the whole ecosystem.
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.900]   Maybe you don't know everything, but you are aware of
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.700]   your areas of opportunity to grow. When you have mastered
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:45.820]   something, you have the distinct benefit of being able to
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:52.060]   lift and stamp the concept of mastery onto other areas and
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:56.620]   master them in an increasingly accelerated way. And our
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:00.380]   mutual friend Tim Ferriss, dear buddy of ours, and you can look
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:05.100]   at Tim was a salsa dancer, a world champion, in fact, and
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:09.660]   before he was an author. And then he had same thing, I think,
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:14.940]   with judo. He had mastered a couple of different areas and
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.940]   then he was able to then apply what he had learned
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.780]   conceptually about how deep do you have to go? Is it mastering
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.420]   a number of skills or is it mastering one skill or one
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.860]   technique? How do you learn who are good mentors and coaches?
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.420]   You get a body of experience and then you can not all of it
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.100]   applies to writing, for example, in Tim's case, but a lot
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:41.100]   of it does. And you can you see this pattern in someone who is
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.020]   world class at something tends to be really freaking good at a
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:49.420]   bunch of things because they have then in turn expanded what
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.060]   they learned about mastering one thing to other things. Not
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:56.620]   always the case. So to your question about if I want to be
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.660]   creative, should I go experimental in one thing or
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.140]   deepen others? I think it is a it's a little bit of a yo-yo.
[00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.740]   The first thing you want to do is cover a broad set of
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.220]   interests. If you do not know what you are passionate about,
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.060]   if you do not know if it's the guitar or ceramics or needle
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.780]   point or cooking, then just experiment and play. And we can
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.180]   there's a lot of cues from our childhood. You talked about
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.300]   making films. You talked about your kids drawing and there's
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:29.020]   all these cues of things that we loved in our history that as
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.380]   an adult, if you reconnect with some of these things, you will
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:36.700]   be shocked at how much joy it could create for you. So it
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.620]   depends then on where you are in that phase. The yo-yo part is
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.660]   go broad at first, then go super deep. And once you go super
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.580]   deep, you understand what mastery is and then you can go
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.820]   broad again. You can start to play in a bunch of different
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.020]   areas and look for the next thing that you'd like to
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.740]   master. Do you have some examples maybe from readers
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.060]   that have written in after applying some of these lessons
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.620]   from the book that might be really relatable to people
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:02.540]   about how creativity could change and reshape someone's
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.580]   life who is not really thinking about it? I can open my phone
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.340]   and go to any Instagram post or go to my DMs, for example, and
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:13.260]   just I'll just I'll do it right now. The first DM I clicked on
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.500]   of the 150 that are here in my phone from yesterday, I just
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.540]   finished chapter two yesterday evening. It's helping me so
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:24.220]   much. Now I can see myself. I see how my creativity is vital
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.340]   and that it's possible for me to get back to joyfully and
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.220]   playfully letting go of the pressure to make money and help
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:34.460]   others simply by letting go allows me to get better at my
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.260]   thing. Thank you so much for this book and having shared your
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.420]   journey and your story. I really do hope to meet you one
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:43.100]   day, probably interviewing you on my soon to be podcast. There
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:47.820]   are literally I get hundreds every day of people who are
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.540]   putting these very simple things to work. I had someone
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:57.340]   not yesterday, day before yesterday. I use the example of
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.940]   driving home a different way to rewire your brain. If you
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.220]   bring the house to the office, we all tend to travel the same
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.060]   path because if we don't have to think about it, we can think
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.740]   about what we're going to cook for dinner or where we're going
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.660]   to go to the movies or who we're going to call that
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:16.060]   evening. And just the simple act of driving home a different
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:21.420]   way every day, slightly different. It helps you see the
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:25.500]   wonder in the world and that you truly are not a robot and
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.700]   you do have autonomy in 99% of the time you turn left and you
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.540]   turn right. There's a recognition and awareness that
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:39.580]   builds up in you that you can change what you did yesterday
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.260]   does not define who you will be today or certainly not
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.860]   tomorrow. Yeah, I already see ways that I could start
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.780]   applying it here. And that's pretty exciting. Are there other
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.460]   ways that you can fuel creativity, whether that's diet
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.820]   or exercise or mindfulness, since all the hacks is about all
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.980]   these things like travel, for example, or changing your body
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.820]   composition, for example, you are putting creativity to work
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.100]   when you do that, because you're creating what create a
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:13.340]   new diet regimen. When you put certain foods in your body, you
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:17.100]   feel better straight up. You give your body the fuel that
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.740]   your individual creature wants. Maybe you're a little nuts, so
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.860]   you cut nuts out and crave protein. You're an O positive
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.140]   blood type and more protein is better. And like when you start
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.500]   to feel your individual human with the right kind of food and
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.260]   you take the right kinds out, you only do that through
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:41.900]   experimenting and you then create a plan for yourself to
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.380]   what you're going to put in your body. And then you add
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.660]   exercise and you go back to your child and you said, God,
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.980]   it was so fun. I was on a long distance running team when I
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.020]   was in junior high, and I just loved it. As a kid, I was very
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.100]   competitive and whatnot. And now as an adult, I'm going to
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.460]   take up running again. And you realize that you're doing all
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.060]   of these things that we've talked about so far in the
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.460]   podcast, right? You're looking back to your childhood thing
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.660]   that made you happy and healthy or you played soccer as a kid
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:09.980]   and you start not as a 42 year old tech executive, you start
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.580]   juggling a soccer ball again in your backyard. Like I'm telling
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.740]   you, that will ignite something awesome in you. And it probably
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:23.180]   will give you one piece of a fitness regimen that will, if
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.140]   you insert that into your, you're already like, okay, I'm
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.220]   going to go to the gym three days a week for an hour. You've
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.060]   infused this play, and it's this combination of play, the
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.620]   utility of moving in a more dynamic way than you do at the
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:40.620]   gym that creates a great workout regimen. And if you create a
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.140]   good food program that you love, that has foods that you love,
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.180]   and you've experimented through preparing these things, and you
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:50.620]   create an exercise regimen that engages you, that is more than
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.860]   just going to the gym three days and sitting on the Nautilus
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.140]   machines, you are going to create more success for
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:00.220]   yourself. You will be more joyful, and you will pursue both
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.500]   of those things more vigorously than if you did not take
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.460]   intention. If you just read some shit on the internet and then
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.700]   went and did, I'm going to do four sets of eight reps of
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.380]   squats, and then I'm going to do, that's not an inspired life.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.100]   And the people that you look up to and appreciate and admire,
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.380]   that is not how they are doing it. I promise you, they are
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:22.860]   taking an active role. And so whether this is for changing
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.740]   your body composition, or for traveling to a place that you've
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:33.580]   always desired to travel to, it's all there for you. That's
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:39.740]   the thing. It's not just about making a work of art, it's about
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.820]   making your life a masterpiece.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:45.580]   Yeah. Yeah. You talked about joyfulness, which I thought was
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.420]   something interesting in that last comment. Is there science
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:53.020]   behind creativity affecting our happiness and our joyfulness in
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:53.660]   life?
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:33:01.340]   Absolutely. So if you can disrupt the typical paradigms,
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.260]   there's, you start to pay attention. And this concept of
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.980]   attention, not mean pay attention like as in what your
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:12.300]   eighth grade math teacher told you, but as attention, the one
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.860]   thing we truly have in this life is where we direct our
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.540]   attention. When you realize that where you place your
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.540]   attention, are you thinking of yourself as lucky or unlucky, as
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.660]   happy or sad, as creative or not creative? When you start
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.580]   deciding to direct your attention, the science is very
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:35.900]   clear. You decide to be happy, and then you get breaks at work
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.500]   and you break through on your diet and your relationship. It's
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.620]   not the other way around. If you wait to be happy until you get
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:46.940]   that break at work, you will largely be waiting forever. So
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:52.860]   there is a high correlation to people's autonomy and their
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:57.660]   creativity as connected to their life arc to not just
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:02.380]   happiness, but and joy, but also to fulfillment, which I think
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:08.780]   is, is very powerful asset. If you feel fulfilled, that is like
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:13.900]   a, it's the wind at your back. Life is, life happens for you
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:14.860]   rather than to you.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.900]   You may not know this, but we share in common is that both of
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.780]   us, I think when we had very little money, decided that we
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.420]   were going to travel the world with our then girlfriends, now
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.780]   wives for multiple months.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:30.220]   Yeah. So we did eight months and we spent almost all of our
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:33.500]   money. I'm curious what kind of impact you think either that
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.340]   trip specifically or just travel in general has on people's life,
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.780]   people's creativity.
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:45.420]   Wow. I think travel is an incredible gift that you can give
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.580]   yourself for so many reasons. I'll, I'll go back to my own
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.300]   personal experience first and then I'll expand it in the
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.860]   particular. I think, I think it was James Joyce in the
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.060]   particular less universal. So I'll share my experience and
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.180]   maybe you can, that will resonate with the listener here.
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:07.260]   So I mentioned that I was from economically, my family didn't
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.980]   have that much money, middle, lower middle class status. Dad
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.660]   was a cop. Mom was a secretary. Bless my mom's heart. We, I
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.860]   remember she didn't bake cookies because sugar was expensive.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.740]   That's the kind of household I was raised in. Temperature was
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:24.540]   58 degrees. If you're cold, put on a sweater and yet they would
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.980]   save up all of their money. And we had some friends who lived
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:33.260]   abroad and we would visit them every summer. And so I went from
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:39.340]   the middle of my lower middle class suburb, largely white,
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.380]   only hanging around with people that looked and talked and
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:47.020]   walked like me. And then imagine plunking yourself down in the
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:53.740]   middle of London in the early eighties. Mohawks, Piccadilly
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:59.820]   Circus, punk rock that co-mingled with art and culture.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.380]   And the same could be true for, my parents are travel super
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.420]   freaks. They, you know, that's basically all they do now is
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.780]   they're in Asia for a month and Russia for a month and they go
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:14.860]   all over the place. But despite from being at a very young age,
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.740]   we had very, I didn't want for anything. I don't want to
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.460]   misrepresent this. I had Adidas with four stripes and like
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:25.100]   upside down Nike's kind of thing. And yet the experience of
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:31.420]   going to going abroad, spending time in the mountains transformed
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.300]   me because I realized that the world that I came from wasn't
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.220]   all that there is. And when I learned about other cultures
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.020]   through, again, things that were engaging to me at the time,
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:46.540]   punk rock music, for example, or cuisine that I remember going
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:51.500]   to Mexico, for example, and the concept of spicy food didn't
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.260]   exist. My mom's very sensitive to spice. So we had no spice,
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.460]   not even any pepper in my house. And I go to Mexico and
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.540]   you realize, oh, so that's a jalapeno. It, you think of the
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.500]   spice of life, but it was like very literal for me. And so
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:09.660]   whether it's cuisine or music or culture, like it, it, there's
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.500]   so much value in it. And I did not know that about you, Chris.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.540]   And I'm guessing that was, that it was part of your courtship
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.380]   and your, your process of, of falling in love and deciding to
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.020]   make a life together, that there's some, that travel has a
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.580]   special place. This is your earlier point about looking back
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.060]   at the things in your life that were valuable or inspirational
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.700]   or whatever to you. And then you can make them come to life
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.260]   in your adult life here with a little bit of intention and
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:38.300]   some, some resources. And I bet that travels special to you,
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.980]   right? Yeah, definitely. I mean, one of the things that I
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.780]   think I probably never recognized until this
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.220]   conversation was, you know, I'm the kind of person at work or
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.540]   in life that someone says, Oh, this isn't going to work. It's
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:53.340]   no, actually let's actually find a different way to do it. Or
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.780]   when something breaks, like a dryer breaks, I'm like, let's
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.700]   just see if we can open it up and figure out how to make it
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:04.220]   work. And we don't have to call someone. And I think that going
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.020]   abroad, traveling different countries, realizing that
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.460]   everyone around the world does so many things in different
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:13.500]   ways. Like in some countries, people eat dinner at 11 PM. In
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.060]   some countries, people take a nap in the afternoon and some
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.700]   countries, they wake up when the sun rises, like everyone
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.260]   lives a life that's totally different, which inherently
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.380]   means anything you're doing, whether it's at work, whether
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.460]   it's for your creative passion, whether it's your just your
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:29.020]   routine at home, there are people that are doing something
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:32.540]   entirely differently, successfully and happily, such
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.380]   that it kind of broadening your horizon, whether it's food,
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.660]   culture, just environment, temperature, you know, all
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.420]   kinds of things. I just want to thank you quick for listening
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:47.020]   to and supporting the show. Your support is what keeps this
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.940]   show going. To get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and

[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:03.980]   I think I have this perspective now that I didn't realize I had
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.260]   and had applied to work and life. Anything can be done in
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.220]   any number of ways. And there's probably a more optimal way.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.180]   And part of the reason I probably love to optimize is
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.900]   that I've seen that there are other ways to do things. So I
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:19.020]   refuse to believe that the status quo is the best we've
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:23.260]   got. And I now attribute that unknowingly before, but to
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.780]   seeing how so many different people live so many different
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:31.660]   ways. I think that's part of the magic, the richness and the
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:36.940]   depth of a life well lived. And to be crystal, like if you
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:41.740]   cannot afford to go to, I just use the example of London
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.220]   because it was something we did as a kid, you don't have to
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.540]   travel tens of thousands of miles on expensive airplanes
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:53.580]   and stay at fancy hotels. Like literally going into the woods
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.460]   and you'll find that you need a different set of skills that
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:01.260]   people do live differently, whether it's somewhere in your
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:05.500]   backyard or across the planet, this exposure to different ways
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.900]   of living. This is part of what I am encouraging people to do.
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:13.100]   It's not dissimilar to going driving home a different way
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:17.500]   every day of the week, because it reminds you that there are
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.460]   so many other things outside of your routine. And right now
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.860]   there's someone who's saying, Oh my gosh, I got two kids under
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.940]   four and it's like whatever the, Hey, look, I'm not saying
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:31.260]   that's not a reality for you. I'm saying that I know there is
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:36.780]   space in your life to do something differently that will
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:41.580]   remind you and reconnect you with the authority, your own
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:45.820]   personal authenticity to pursue, to move in the direction,
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:51.740]   however fast or slow of the life of your dreams. And part of
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.580]   the way you build dreams, part of what our culture has really
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.380]   whiffed on the last two decades is the imagined part of my
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:02.620]   creative process. Part of what traveling does is helps you
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:07.660]   imagine you want for yourself in this life, right? Maybe I used
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.700]   the example earlier of going to Copenhagen. Maybe you're
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:14.060]   inspired by the architecture and the simplicity. And so that
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.700]   you want to bring that experience of what it felt like
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.660]   to live in that architecture back because you're going to
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.300]   build a home for yourself one day. And you've experienced
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.460]   what it feels like to live in a really well-designed place.
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.260]   And you want to then bring that back for yourself here in the
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.100]   States or wherever you live.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.060]   - Yeah. And if anyone's listening to this podcast,
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:35.020]   there's a dozen episodes about, you know, how to travel for
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.980]   free and credit card points and miles. We are fortunate that
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:42.380]   this group is exposed to many ways to make a trip to Europe
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.100]   cost almost nothing. A trip to Africa costs almost nothing.
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:48.220]   There's a handful of signup bonuses that make that even
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:48.620]   possible.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:53.900]   - It's so true, man. I'm glad, I'm fortunate for you and I'm
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:57.900]   grateful for you and your show for helping people live a
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:02.300]   richer life through a variety of hacks, whether that's travel
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.820]   or this case, it's one part psychology, two parts taking
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:10.860]   action to hack, I think, culture. And as soon as you do
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:13.420]   this stuff, this is the cool thing. As soon as you do it
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.340]   once, you're like looking around, you're like, I feel like
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.100]   you just got away with something. Like what? I have my
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:22.780]   own podcast now? Or I'm going to Africa for $1,800 for two
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:26.620]   weeks. Like how is this possible? And it's, there's
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.980]   something unlocks in you and you realize this world of
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.860]   possibility and then you can lift and stamp that world of
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:37.580]   possibility onto other things. It's this beautiful virtuous
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:37.900]   cycle.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:42.300]   - Yeah. I think there's a good segue to ask you, are there
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.500]   things you do in your daily routine that other people might
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.580]   benefit from adopting or trying that might fall in the category
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.420]   of kind of life hacks or anything like that?
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:55.100]   - Sure. At the risk of sounding cliche, because even the
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.900]   concept of a morning routine wasn't really popular on the
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.460]   internet 10 years ago. And here we are, everyone's talking
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.620]   about it, but I would underscore that there's a reason
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:06.380]   for that because starting owning the morning and, or some
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:10.140]   sort of a routine will help you own the day and having a
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:14.860]   routine and having an element of your routine being to break
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.540]   your routine. To me, that's, that is the life hack that is
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:25.660]   most unrecognized, unrealized and under, under planned for.
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.540]   I am, I live the things that I'm talking about here, like
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.860]   driving home a different way or listening to some different
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:34.620]   music or trying to learn new things from friends who are
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:38.300]   experts in the world of fill in the blank, if I have some
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:42.060]   benign or new found curiosity to it. So I think that's the
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.980]   big takeaway is what can you do to provide space in your
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.940]   routine to do things differently, whether that's an
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.820]   extra half an hour to cook dinner, or we've talked about
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.460]   carving out some time to travel to a far away, distant place
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.340]   that does things very different than we do, or driving home a
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:00.700]   different way or pursuing a hobby that is something
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.180]   creative such that you can rewire your brain and apply
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.140]   more creativity in your life. Make space for all that stuff
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:09.980]   because it is critical. That is what most people who are
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.420]   successful and fulfilled have a routine that allows for these
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.860]   things. And it's not list, you know, you hear like, oh, I eat
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:20.780]   30 grams of protein when I wake up and I true, but again, you
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.820]   deconstruct the most successful and fulfilled people and they
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.780]   make time for the stuff that I'm talking about for
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:32.220]   creativity. Now, I do want to endorse cold water therapy
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:36.060]   specifically because I've been a practitioner for about 10
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:40.220]   years, started off with cold showers, and then I would go to
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:45.260]   spas or gender specific places that had cold water that I
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:48.540]   could get into for long durations of time. And then it
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:53.740]   went to me having my own cold plunge at my house in Seattle.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.860]   And then I'm right here up at our little beach house and I'm
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.300]   100 feet from the Puget Sound, which right now is 49 degrees,
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.540]   48 degrees in that water. So I am a huge advocate of cold
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:08.060]   water. If you haven't had Vim Hoff on the show, he's, you
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.340]   know, written a bunch of books. He's been on my podcast, the
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:14.940]   Chase Jarvis live show, you can easily search and read the
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.500]   benefits of cold water exposure. It is better than
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.420]   coffee, great for your immune system, and very good for
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:26.460]   personal mindset, psychology. It is interesting to every day
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:30.780]   get into very cold water, despite never wanting to. So
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.500]   your ability to willingly make yourself uncomfortable for a
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.220]   short amount of time every day, turns out it's pretty, it's
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.900]   pretty valuable. Funny, funny enough that we have a hot tub
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.020]   in our home. And that hot tub, we stopped using it for a few
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.740]   months. So I drained it, I filled it back up, pump doesn't
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.700]   work. Looked outside last night, it's in the 40s. I was like,
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:52.220]   Oh, I got a cold plunge. Doesn't work. Can't get the hot tub
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.180]   working. So I was telling my wife, I was like, Hey, I guess
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.540]   now we have a cold plunge until someone replaces this pump,
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.700]   which by the way, is something I'm creatively trying to figure
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:05.660]   out how to fix. But until then, we have that. One thing when it
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:09.500]   comes to creativity, one of the things that I know I face a lot
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.620]   that I want to touch on before we go getting in everyone knows
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.740]   that awesome zone flow state that but what about when you're
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.540]   stuck? Do you have any tips for people that are sitting there
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.420]   trying to be creative on something, whether it's writing,
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:25.100]   but working anything, and they hit that creative block? How do
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:31.100]   you get past that and move forward? Play it is it is play
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:36.540]   is a incredibly powerful lever. Go goof off, go do something
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:40.940]   that that brings you a ton of joy that is ideally not at all
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.180]   related to the thing into the problem you're trying to solve.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:48.380]   Creativity happens again. It's this virtuous cycle. You try it,
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.620]   you get a little more courage, you try it some more, you get
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.540]   a little courage. It's like there's so many virtuous cycles
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:58.700]   or positive feedback loops or leverage that we can get from
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:02.460]   these things. And this relationship between joy and play
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:05.340]   is a very strong one. And let's just take your hot tub pump,
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:09.260]   for example. If you set a deadline and you need to have it
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.660]   fixed by Friday, and you literally sit there in front of
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:15.180]   the thing, there will be times on Wednesday at noon when you've
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.580]   been trying to fix it and you can't fix it. You're like, I
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:19.900]   need to stop staring at this pump because I'm thinking in
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:25.020]   loops and I'm trying to I'm not unlocking anything here. And so
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.540]   you go hit a bucket of golf balls or go get in your cold
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.980]   plunge or go do something that brings you a lot of joy. And you
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:34.380]   sit down at that problem again, and the problem looks
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:38.860]   differently. This is, again, programming your body with
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:42.380]   powerful neurochemistry, a little bit this sort of work
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:47.100]   hard rest cycle that we know is good for the human body and the
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.140]   human body appreciates things like sleep and good nutrition.
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.940]   There's a list in my book, Creative Calling, about
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.420]   creativity boosters and zappers. And there are some very
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.860]   simple physical things like going out and play. This is why
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:03.260]   I love to look back into our childhood and think of the
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:06.380]   things that brought us a ton of joy. There's a guy who used to
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.380]   work for Tim named Charlie Hone. I don't know if you remember
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:11.500]   Charlie. He wrote a book called Play It Away, which is a really
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.300]   interesting book that he wrote, which is specifically around
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:18.460]   playing to reduce anxiety. And one of the things, it's just a
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.740]   simple exercise that I took out of his book as an example here
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:26.620]   for your listeners. He bought himself like 100 baseballs, and
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:31.580]   he and a buddy go to a park and a buddy slow pitches, and they
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.380]   just take turns whacking these balls all over the baseball
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:37.340]   field. Then they go pick them up. And he said in 30 minutes,
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.380]   each of you hit 100 baseballs, you walked around, you got
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.020]   outside. And because he loved playing baseball and hitting
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.700]   balls as a kid in the batting cages, he said it just
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:50.060]   completely transforms his headspace. And then he goes back
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.580]   to whatever the problem at hand is, and he's refreshed and
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:59.660]   invigorated. And so I like to think of, I think those things
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:05.820]   specifically playing are very helpful, and they help in a
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:10.860]   myriad of ways. It's like a panacea for inaction. And we've
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:14.220]   lost that in the same way that we've largely lost our
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:19.020]   imagination. And we have to do actually active work to get it
[00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:21.660]   back. So I think play is very valuable. And I will put an
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.540]   asterisk by this, which is if you're sitting in front of a
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.980]   problem, and you're let's just say you're a professional
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:32.060]   creator, you're a copywriter or a designer or something you are
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:36.540]   paid to create on demand. And that actually comes through
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:40.380]   discipline, right? That comes through people say, Oh, I just
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.900]   have a blank page here. And I'm stuck. I can't write anything.
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:47.900]   Why don't you write 500 shitty words, you show me your best
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.940]   stuff. And then a photographer will say, Oh, I know, I'll show
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:53.340]   you this. And it says, I don't want to show you because I'm not
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.580]   really proud of my work. Okay, then show me your worst stuff.
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:59.100]   And show me my worst stuff. Yeah, just show me something
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:02.940]   because the something means that you're working, that you're I
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:06.380]   think Chuck Close said, being inspiration is for amateurs, the
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:10.700]   rest of us sit down and we get to work. So I like the mix of
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:15.100]   like tough love and wild inspiration. The tough love is
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.820]   sit down at a certain time and do this work every day, even if
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:21.500]   you don't feel like it. And if you're just doing that, and
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:25.580]   you're not inspired, doing things that bring joy and play
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:30.220]   and laughter, going to stand up comedy, hitting baseballs,
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.860]   taking up running again, these things that will bring you joy
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:36.140]   that are from your past. This combination of those two things
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.780]   of sitting in front of the page and doing the work anyway, and
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:42.300]   taking breaks. This is a very powerful comment.
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:46.140]   Yeah, I think this is actually a great place to wrap up because
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:49.100]   everyone here can hopefully take some time in the rest of their
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:52.940]   day and go play a little and, and get inspired. But obviously,
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.260]   I think everyone needs to check out this book. I really enjoyed
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.820]   it link to that in the show notes. I think it's the
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:02.300]   creative calling.com is also the book's website. Yep. Yep.
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.460]   Where else can people find out what you're up to?
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:08.780]   I'm at Chase Jarvis everywhere on the internet, Instagram,
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:12.620]   YouTube, Twitter, whatnot. And I would also steer people to
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:18.380]   creative live.com, which is, we've built a learning platform
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:23.180]   specifically for creators and entrepreneurs. So it is whether
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.940]   you are just dabbling, and you want to learn skills from
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:29.740]   someone who is the best in the world. There are people who
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:34.460]   literally are Pulitzer Prize winners, winners, the highest
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:37.980]   performers in every category from photography, design,
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:42.220]   filmmaking, entrepreneurship, you can learn from these people
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.940]   there. So whether you're trying to pick up new skills or going
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.340]   for inspiration, specifically creative inspiration, there's
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:52.380]   more than 2000 classes there for an annual subscription price
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:55.660]   of 150 bucks or something 149 bucks. That's be another
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:57.180]   destination there on the internet.
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:00.700]   Yeah, when I worked at Google Ventures, we were investors got
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:04.220]   a chance to take a few courses. They're fantastic. Chase, thank
[00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:05.660]   you so much for being here.
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.620]   Chris, thanks for doing the show. All the hacks is a really
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:11.580]   fun place. It's a fun destination out there in the
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:15.260]   internet media universe. Congrats on making a successful
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:18.380]   show. And I'll be set slightly differently. Congrats on
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:22.380]   creating an amazing show that that a lot of people benefit
[00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.180]   from. Keep doing it.
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:24.780]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:30.700]   That was amazing. Thank you so much for listening. Recognizing
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:33.420]   my creativity in the middle of this conversation feels like a
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.620]   big unlock. And I'm excited to see how that affects my ability
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:40.220]   to be creative with the rest of my life. Also, I'm really
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:42.780]   grateful for all the amazing questions you've been sending.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.660]   And I'll be doing a Q&A episode to answer all of them.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.940]   Actually, a few episodes. So please keep them coming as I
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.740]   genuinely love hearing from you and would love to be able to
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:54.540]   help you all continue to upgrade your lives. You can send
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:57.980]   anything my way, even if you just want to say hi, by emailing
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:03.340]   chris@allthehacks.com. That's it for now. See you next time.
