[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   So first off, please join me in welcoming Ray Dalio to the stage
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:13.200]   Wow! Fuck yeah! Ray Dalio! Oh my god, real legit! We got Ray Dalio!
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.200]   Don't let your winners ride
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.200]   Rain Man David Sass
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.200]   And it's said we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.200]   Love you guys, I mean queen of quinoa!
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.200]   Ray, I don't know how we got you to this stage
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.200]   It must have been the fact that I just said your name 400 times last year
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200]   This guy's read your book
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   Do not be bored
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.200]   Yeah, but I will say you were by far my top choice as a guest to have at the All in Summit 2023
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200]   Which I took advantage of because I got to produce it this year
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.200]   You guys have heard me talk about Ray's book, Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.200]   Why Nations Succeed and Fail on the Pod a lot
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:03.200]   And I think it really encapsulates so well why we are observing a lot of the social, economic and political shifts
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.200]   that are underway in the US and around the world today
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.200]   Increasing civil unrest, divisive politics, our desire for external conflict, inflation, budget and debt problems, etc
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.200]   They've all played out before as nations have risen and fallen
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200]   Jason likes to make fun of the term "declinists"
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:30.200]   But I think it's more broader than that, which is what is the cycle that happens with social systems that we call nation states over time
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200]   Ray's book was my content pick of the year in 2021
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.200]   And I first learned about Ray when he published Principles as a PDF in 2011
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200]   You put that out for free on the internet, thank you
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200]   Which was an internal document you used at Bridgewater
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.200]   And I don't know if anyone else downloaded it and read it
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.200]   But I was a young CEO in 2011
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   And I read that PDF and it made a big impact on me and how I thought about management, prioritization, decision making and myself
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.200]   As a kid growing up in Nassau, New York, Nassau County, New York
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   Ray earned money mowing lawns, shoveling snow, delivering newspapers and caddying for Wall Street tycoons
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   He later got a summer job with a Wall Street trader that he caddied for
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   And ended up starting Bridgewater two years after he got his MBA at Harvard in 1973
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200]   Make sure I get that right
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   By 2013, Bridgewater was the largest hedge fund in the world
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   Today managing well over $100 billion in assets
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   Ray spends much of his time sharing his analyses and thoughts today
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   And his viewpoints openly and freely
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   And for that we appreciate him and thank him and excited to welcome him here today
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   So Ray, maybe you could just very briefly kind of summarize the cycle that you highlight in your book that I mentioned
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   And the five great kind of drivers that you've observed
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   And tell us a little bit about the simple kind of macro picture
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   I know you've got something you could share on it as well
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   Yeah, sure
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   First I should explain that experience I had of learning that many of the things that surprised me
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   Surprised me because they didn't happen in my lifetime before
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   But they happened many times in history
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   The first time I was clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 1971
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   And the United States, Nixon defaulted on the promise to deliver gold for money
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   Because they didn't have enough money, real money, gold
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   And it went down, I went on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange expecting a big down
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   It went up a lot
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   That's because I never had a devaluation on behalf of that
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   I found that in March 1933 the exact same thing happened with Roosevelt on the radio
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   Same thing
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:42.200]   So then I studied the 30s, what happened in 1938 in terms of the depression leading to the wars and so on
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   And the interest rates hitting zero
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   Is the exact same thing that happened in 2008
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   It was because I studied that that we were able to make a lot of money in the 2008 financial crisis
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   So three things started to happen in my lifetime, our lifetimes, that never happened before
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   And I needed therefore to study them in history
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   The first is the amount of debt and money creation
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   Huge amounts of debt and money creation
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   Does that matter?
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   What is the rise and decline of a reserve currency?
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   How does that all work?
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   I needed to see the cycles for that
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   The second was the amount of internal political conflict
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   In particular populism of the left and populism of the right
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   And a populist is a person who will not accept losing
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   They fight with their contingency
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   And that dysfunction and that lack of willingness to lose
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   Then had January 6th, came out after the book
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   And there's a dynamic that we're going on for that
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   And the third of course is the great power conflict
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.200]   In other words the rise of a comparable economic and military power
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   In the form of China rising and competing with the United States
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   Which is also changing that world order
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   Those three things never happened in my lifetime
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   But are big things that are affecting things
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   When I went back in history
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   I said I needed to study how these things work
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   Sometimes we overlook the really big things
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   So I went back and I studied that
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   And I saw that there were two others that had enormous impact
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   The two others were acts of nature
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.200]   In particular droughts, floods, and pandemics
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   And they killed more people
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   And they toppled more empires
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   And changed more world orders than anything
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   And certainly big issue now
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   And then number five is technological changes and how they evolve
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   So I needed to study those five forces
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   I saw that there's this cycle that repeats over
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   For good cause-effect relationships
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   I don't believe in a cycle just because it repeats
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   I started to understand the cause-effect relationships
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   I have a clip here if I can show you
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   Just four minutes, just a brief summary of the cycle
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   Can you hit it with the clip?
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   I studied the ten most powerful empires
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   Over the last 500 years
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   And the last three reserve currencies
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   It took me through the rise and decline
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   Of the Dutch Empire and the Gilder
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   The British Empire and the Pound
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   The rise and early decline
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   In the United States Empire and the Dollar
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   And the decline and rise of the Chinese Empire
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   And its currencies
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   As well as the rise and decline of the Spanish
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   German, French, Indian, Japanese, Russian
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   And Ottoman Empires
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   Along with their significant conflicts
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.200]   As measured in this chart
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   To understand China's patterns better
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   I also studied the rise and fall of Chinese dynasties
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.200]   And their monies back to the year 600
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   Because looking at all these measures at once
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   Can be confusing
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.200]   I'll focus on the four most important ones
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   The Dutch, British, US and Chinese
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.200]   You'll quickly notice the pattern
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   Now let's simplify the form of it
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   As you can see, they transpired in overlapping cycles
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   That lasted about 250 years
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.200]   With 10 to 20 year transition periods between them
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.200]   Typically these transitions have been periods of great conflict
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.200]   Because leading powers don't decline without a fight
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.200]   So how am I measuring an empire's power?
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   In this study I used eight metrics
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   Each country's measure of total power
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   Is derived by averaging them together
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   They are education, inventiveness and technology development
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   Competitiveness in global markets
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.200]   Economic output, share of world trade
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.200]   Military strength
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   The power of their financial center for capital markets
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   And the strength of their currency as a reserve currency
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   Because these powers are measurable
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   We can see how strong each country is now
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   Was in the past
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   And whether they're rising or declining
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.200]   By examining the sequences from many countries
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   We can see how a typical cycle transpires
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   And because the wiggles can be confusing
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   We can simplify it a bit
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   To focus on the pattern of cause-effect relationships
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   That drive the rise and decline of a typical empire
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   As you can see, better education
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   Typically leads to increased innovation and technology development
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:48.200]   And with a lag, the establishment of the currency as a reserve currency
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   You can also see that these forces then declined in a similar order
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   Reinforcing each other's decline
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   Let's now look at the typical sequence of events going on inside a country
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   That produces these rises and declines
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   In a nutshell, the big cycle typically begins after a major conflict
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   Often a war, establishes the new leading power
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   And the new world order
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   Because no one wants to challenge this power
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   A period of peace and prosperity typically follows
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   As people get used to this peace and prosperity
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   They increasingly bet on it continuing
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   They borrow money to do that
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   Which eventually leads to a financial bubble
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.200]   The empire's share of trade grows
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   And when most transactions are conducted in its currency
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   It becomes a reserve currency
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.200]   Which leads to even more money
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   At the same time, this increased prosperity
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   Distributes wealth unevenly
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   So the wealth gap typically grows between the rich haves
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   And the poor have-nots
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   Eventually, the financial bubble bursts
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   Which leads to the printing of money
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   There is an increased internal conflict between the rich and the poor
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   Which leads to some form of revolution to redistribute wealth
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   This can happen peacefully or as a civil war
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.200]   While the empire struggles with this internal conflict
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   Its power diminishes relative to external rival powers on the rise
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   When a new rising power gets strong enough to compete with the dominant power
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.200]   That is having domestic breakdowns
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   External conflicts, most typically wars, take place
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   Out of these internal and external wars
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   Come new winners and losers
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   Then the winners get together to create the new world order
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   And the cycle begins again
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   The book's amazing
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   And the amount of work you put into this is extraordinary
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.200]   And it's just really great intellectually
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.200]   I'm curious, when we look at those four groups
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.200]   Since you wrote the book
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.200]   China, I think we'd all agree, has changed significantly
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   Perhaps, I think, best described as maybe being in decline in many ways
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   And disconnecting from the West
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   And it's also, I believe, when you look at the countries you studied
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   Perhaps one of the only modern authoritarian countries
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   To, you know, perhaps have an ability to take the crown
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   If they were to continue
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   So, two-part question
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   How does everything you've learned and studied
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   Impact your thinking when one person, an authoritarian, Xi Jinping
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   Is running China and disconnecting it from the rest of the world
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   In terms of their ability
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   And then, do you consider this
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   If they did succeed in becoming the dominant power in the world
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.200]   What do you think that does for humanity?
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   There are a bunch of questions in there
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   I'll try to remember them and take them once at a time
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   I think China is going to be a big power for the foreseeable future
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.200]   I think the basic picture in China
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   The United States, the emergence of India and so on
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   The world order is going to change in a very profound way
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   We can't say who's going to be the winner and the loser of this game
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   But I think we do know that
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   This conflict is going to be with us
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.200]   And it's totally changing the world order
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   When you're asking, like, who's going to be the winner of this game
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.200]   Like, I'll tell you history
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   In the history of democracy
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   As Plato described in the Republic
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   There's a cycle
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.200]   And one of the great vulnerabilities of democracies
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   Is the disorderliness, the anarchy that comes from a conflict
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   And so you're asking me to compare democracy
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   And also what I'll call capitalism
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   With authoritarianism
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.200]   And let's call it communism, that version of it
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.200]   Or quasi-capitalism, maybe
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.200]   But we know what we mean
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.200]   Yeah
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.200]   Okay, so
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.200]   So when
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   The risk of capitalism
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   Is when you have the wealth gap clash
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.200]   And the opportunity gap clash
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.200]   And the risk, and that produces a risk for democracy
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   So in the '30s, four major democracies
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.200]   Because of that dynamic
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   Chose to be, their parliaments chose to be autocracies
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   That happened in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Japan
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   So the risk, both have risks
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   I came from, and I've been, we've all been blessed
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.200]   With this amazing environment
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.200]   That equal opportunity, the ability to be creative
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.200]   Rule of law, civility
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   But if we risk those things, in both of those
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   Then we have a great risk
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   So on this war, I think it depends more on
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   How we are, with our circumstances
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   To be strong and capable
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   And relative to them
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   It certainly is going to be a test of the systems
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   Yeah
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   So in a way, us focusing inward
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.200]   On what we do here in America
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.200]   With our democracy, and making it high function
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.200]   Is as important as managing our relationship with China
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   And if you were to look at China and India
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   And those two countries specifically
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.200]   And you were to handicap them, as you are uniquely qualified to do
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   Maybe you could just broadly handicap India versus China for us
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   Because this is a topic we've been talking about, Chamath and I
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   And the other besties on the show, a whole bunch
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   And it's now the largest population in the world
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   I guess people don't realize that
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   And they're continuing to grow
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   And the birth rate is in decline in China
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   So maybe a little bit on India and how you look at it
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   Yeah, and I should emphasize that every conclusion that I have
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   Is a function of measuring statistics
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   And having them as leading indicators
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   And we have 10 year growth rate estimates for China
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.200]   Excuse me, India, and all the countries, top 22 countries
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.200]   And you can see it online if you want, country by country
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   And the reasons for it
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   India has the highest potential growth rate
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   I think India is where China was when I started to go
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.200]   I started to go in 1984
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.200]   So if you look at the complexion, the per capita income
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   And I think Modi is a Deng Xiaoping
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   So that you have a massive reform, development, creativity
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   All those elements
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   There are of course issues, risk issues
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.200]   But India is very important
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   Now of course there's a religious internal issue
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   Having to do with the population
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   Has 240 million Muslims
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   And I don't think that any of these issues is going to stop India
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   Also in history, the countries that were the neutral countries
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   Did the best
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   So in other words, better than the winners in wars
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   So as we have this conflict between the United States and China
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   And its allies, Russia and so on
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   As we see that line up
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   Countries that are in the middle, like India
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   Are going to be net beneficiaries of that
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   Middle East is again
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   So there are two big epicenters where things are happening fast
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   And quick and getting better
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.200]   And one of them is, well let's say three
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   There's the ASEAN countries
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   We can say that Singapore is essentially a hub
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   But the ASEAN countries, which is Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   And all of that, that's going to be a great area
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.200]   The Middle East in terms of particularly the Gulf countries
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   The amount of money and they're making talent magnets
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.200]   They're attracting people
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.200]   You look at how the change in wealth is taking place
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.200]   That's certainly it, and India
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   Ray, can I just ask back on China
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   You know Chinese leadership
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.200]   You've spoken and had relations there for many years
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   Can you share with us your point of view
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   On how they think about their position in the world
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.200]   And how you understand their intentions
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   Yes, I'll give you my thoughts
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   I'm not making judgments, I'm just passing along, okay
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.200]   They think there are two different systems, two different approaches
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   They would think that an autocratic system
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   They used to have a committee that would make it
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   But they would say it would be very much like a company
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.200]   If you had a company, you have a board
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   You have the executive committee and so on and so forth
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.200]   And you make sure you get the leadership
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.200]   And then they would say that the world should have a competition
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   And that throughout history
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   There were these competitions in all the various ways we talk about
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.200]   And there's an emergence of that
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   And that there's an inevitability
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   And I think we say that there's an inevitability
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   For a conflict
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   Because there's a containment
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   And then there's a desire to expand
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.200]   And it's like almost keeping a lid on a boiling pot
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   That's the type of situation
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   I can go on at length about the particulars of their thing
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.200]   They have a very good historical perspective
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   Because their history has been literally 5,000 years
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   Like we think of ours
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.200]   They remember the particulars and all the leaders study that
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   And there is a cycle that they're very conscious about
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.200]   So for example, the big risk that they believe is instability
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   So she says that the big storm on the horizon
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   He keeps referring to the big storm on the horizon
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:28.200]   And that relates to the conflict in the world that we're talking about
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   But it also relates to the fact that they've got a debt problem
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   They have a debt restructuring problem
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.200]   And their instinct through history, the learning of history
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.200]   Is that during such periods of time
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   Internal conflict is a big threat
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.200]   And therefore autocracy, strong controls are the things to have
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   Okay, now we can explore the relative merits of that internal conflict
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.200]   And so on, but that's basically their perspective
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.200]   One of the things that I'm struck by is if you look in the past
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   A lot of these conflicts were started because it's about commerce
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.200]   Or some form of capital or some critical resource
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.200]   And then it just kind of like escalates
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.200]   And then you have these large re-transformations and reallocations of power
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.200]   But in a world where we are now sort of almost on the precipice
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   Closer than we've ever been to this sort of form of abundance
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   Whether it's quasi-costless energy
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   Whether it's food that's available to be printed or made or what have you
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.200]   What do we fight over in this next great conflict?
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   What is worth fighting over?
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:45.200]   Okay, so let me first deal with the productivity thing
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.200]   Throughout history, productivity has been the greatest
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   And so if you take the '20s, we had the productivity
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   Most inventions, most patents and so on in the '20s
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   You also had a debt problem
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   And you also had a wealth gap problem
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:04.200]   So I believe that in terms of the new technology
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   We're going to really see new technologies
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   Now, they can be used for weapons or they can be used for productivity
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   But we're going to have to have a reorganization
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.200]   Of how are we going to redistribute the wealth and opportunities and so on
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.200]   So if we come back, I think we just have to look at
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.200]   What are we fighting for now?
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.200]   What's going on?
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   And I think that, of course, there's a fight over money
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.200]   If you have a downturn, if you have a debt problem
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   And I think there's good reason to believe we will
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   We can get into that in a minute
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   But they fight over money
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   And they fight over differences in values
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   In other words, the differences in values
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   Like how do you educate your children?
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   What is transgender issues and education issues
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   And those types of things
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   And so I think you're seeing those things to fight over
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   You're seeing plenty to fight over
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.200]   And let's say we don't fight
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   Let's pray we don't fight
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   What we need is to come together
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.200]   But if, let's say we don't fight
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.200]   You're still going to have to deal with
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   How do you redistribute not only money
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.200]   But how do you redistribute opportunities?
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   And that's going to take figuring it out, right?
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.200]   And there's going to be an argument over how they do that
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   No, I think this is really interesting
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.200]   Because I think you're saying
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:23.200]   If you don't fight over the historic area of battlefields
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.200]   If we're not fighting over resources
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.200]   We are going to fight over social issues
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.200]   Or social constructs or social beliefs
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   But I'm also saying you're going to fight over resources
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.200]   Like, we have debt
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   And we'll operate as though it doesn't matter
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   And we'll continue to have the pile
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.200]   If you look at history
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.200]   And we can get into why it is
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   It is not that that goes on a while
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.200]   And you can't continue to increase your living standards
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.200]   By borrowing more than you're spending
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.200]   You know, you can't keep accumulating your debt
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.200]   Because it has to matter
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.200]   So these types of things, as they build up
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.200]   As the debt builds up
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.200]   As the wealth gaps build up
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.200]   And the values gaps build up
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   And then there's difference in reaction to controls
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.200]   Some people, so you see the movement
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   We will have things to fight over
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   At the same time
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   As we hopefully will have a productivity miracle
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   I think that in the next five years
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.200]   I think year by year
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.200]   We're going to go through a time warp
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   You're going to see radical disorder
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   In the next five years
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   As each one of those things comes to pass
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   First with the elections as we have
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   Then we have the conflict with the geopolitical conflict
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   Then we have the climate issue
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   Which by the way is a very expensive issue
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   We should talk about how costly that issue is
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.200]   And then we're going to have this issue of technology
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.200]   Which can provide the greatest miracle
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   But also is a weapon
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   Just frame for us your thoughts on debt for a second
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   How do you think about debt as an absolute construct
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.200]   Or a relative construct?
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.200]   Especially sovereign debt
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.200]   There is a US debt
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.200]   But then there are also every other 182 countries
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   Who have a ton of debt
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.200]   And so how do you think about debt
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.200]   Debt to GDP relatively and in absolute terms?
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.200]   For any country
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.200]   And quite often many countries
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.200]   Because they go through the cycle together
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   As they did in the 30s
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   What happens is debt rises relative to incomes
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   And what that means mechanistically
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.200]   Is that debt service payments rise relative to incomes
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   And so it squeezes out consumption
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   As the compound
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   And what happens is there's a realization
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   That they have to print money
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   So I think you're going to see
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   In the next downturn
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   Another move to print money
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   There are certain things that are going on now
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   That means that the big risk comes
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.200]   When they don't want to hold those bonds anymore
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.200]   Because the supply demand
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   Think about that supply demand
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   It has a deficit
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.200]   It has to borrow
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   And so it sells its bonds
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.200]   Who are the buyers of the bonds?
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.200]   Why do they buy?
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   The buyers of the bonds buy
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   Because there's an attractive return
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.200]   Not only do you have to sell those amounts of bonds
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   But when they start to realize
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   That I'm not getting good returns on those bonds
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.200]   They can sell those bonds
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.200]   There are 31 trillion dollars in bonds
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   What would they own instead?
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   They always own tangible things
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.200]   And those things can also be
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.200]   It could be equities
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.200]   It could be many other things
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   It could be gold
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.200]   Gold has always been accepted as a money
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.200]   Because nobody else
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   There's a saying that gold is the only asset you can have
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.200]   Not somebody else's liability
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.200]   In other words, dependent on getting paid
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.200]   You can have that intrinsic value
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   And for a long period of time
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   It's been valued and you can move it between countries
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   But also, different countries prosper
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.200]   So you'll see the countries
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   Some of the countries that we mentioned
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   They will prosper through that
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   The United States made most of its money
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   Because it didn't enter the war
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   It was before, on World War II and World War I
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   The United States became the richest country
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   Because of the money it made before it entered the war
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   So those countries will prosper
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   And in those countries
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   Then certain real estate will profit
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200]   Hard assets
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   But where you have that is very, very important
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.200]   There's something about wealth inequality
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.200]   That I just wanted to get your thoughts on as well
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   Which is, I saw a chart in The Economist recently
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.200]   Where they showed on a purchasing price parity basis
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.200]   Normalized across all the Western countries
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   That US median income
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.200]   So median, so not thinking about means
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:04.200]   Is now 45, almost 47 thousand dollars
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   Doing much better than Britain, most of continental Europe, etc.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.200]   So on a functional purchasing power parity basis
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.200]   A lot of Americans are doing much, much better
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   There was a UPS renegotiation for their labor contracts
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   Drivers can now make 180 grand a year
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.200]   I mean, there's a lot of money to be made
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:30.200]   But then there's this real but also hyper-perceived imbalance
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.200]   And I just wanted to get your sense of
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.200]   How much of this is the social media phenomenon
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.200]   Of just never having enough
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.200]   And how much of it is true when you look at data like that?
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:48.200]   There's a huge wealth gap
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.200]   And the nature of our economy is producing this
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   So I can rattle off a bunch of statistics
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.200]   What happened, as happens in these cycles
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.200]   Is that when you have the type of situation we have
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   The government will take on the debt
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.200]   And it'll send out the money
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   So the mechanics of that were that
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.200]   There was more checks and more money sent
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.200]   Than there was loss of income, by a lot
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.200]   So a lot of money went out
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.200]   And as a result of that
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   The financial conditions of the household sector
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   Improved, generally speaking
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.200]   While the financial conditions of the government sector
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.200]   The government got into a lot more debt
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.200]   That's very classic at the end of the cycle
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   Because there's an imbalance between demand and purchases of bonds
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   There is the central bank buying those bonds
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   That monetization
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.200]   So now, that's what the wealth gap looks like
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.200]   And that also creates more of the inflation
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   Because the household sector, buying large benefits
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.200]   But when you look at the differences
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   I'll tell you a personal case
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   So that I can understand
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.200]   I live in Connecticut
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   And Connecticut's usually one, two, or three
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.200]   Of the richest states in the country
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.200]   22% of the high school students in Connecticut
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.200]   Either have dropped out of high school
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:21.200]   Or are failing classes with absentee rates of greater than 25%
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   The $600 million a year goes to incarcerations
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.200]   There is a level below which
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.200]   No human beings should be allowed to
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   Let alone raising kids and families
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   I live in Greenwich, Connecticut
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   A wealthy place
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   My number won't be up to date
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.200]   Maybe five years old
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   Per capita students in high school
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.200]   Costs would be $24,000 a person
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.200]   In Bridgeport, Connecticut, up the road
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.200]   $14,000 a person
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.200]   There were 60,000 kids in Connecticut
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   That didn't have computers
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.200]   How were they going to get education?
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   The state wasn't going to pay for it
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.200]   We philanthropically bought them
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.200]   So now, we don't create a bottom
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.200]   An acceptable bottom
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   The idea of equal opportunity
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   I was blessed with it
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.200]   I think we probably all were blessed with equal opportunity
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.200]   All you need is
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.200]   Parents will take care of you
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.200]   Go to a public school
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.200]   Come out to a world of equal opportunity
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   Equal stability
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   If you have those things
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.200]   If you take all those measures
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.200]   The gaps in those things are greater than they have ever been
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   Right. Saxon?
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.200]   Let me ask. Ray, I think I fundamentally agree with your critique
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.200]   That America is looking more and more like a late-stage empire
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.200]   Like a late-stage Roman Empire
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.200]   We have this massive debt
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.200]   And we're debasing our currency
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   Like the Roman Empire
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.200]   We have all these far-flung military wars
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   Which we lose all over the world
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.200]   We're wracked by internal divisions
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.200]   So I think I agree with that part of it
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.200]   At the same time
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.200]   We do seem to be really good still at technological innovation
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   In the last year, we've had this breakthrough with AI
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.200]   With large language models
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.200]   I'm wondering, is that
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.200]   Well, first of all, is that a mirage or do you agree with that?
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.200]   And then if you do agree that we're still really good at technology
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   Is there anything in the historical pattern that's like that?
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   Where you have an empire that's declining in every visible way
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   Except for the one that really undergirds our power
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.200]   Which is technology
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.200]   Well, the late '20s in the United States was such a classic example
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.200]   We had more innovations, more technology
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.200]   All of these cycles
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   If I was to go back to the Industrial Revolution
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.200]   Late 1800s
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.200]   And then you turn
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.200]   When there's a lot of debt
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.200]   And a big wealth gap
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.200]   In 1907, you have the Panic of 1907
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   Boom, you have this internal conflict
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.200]   And you had the First World War
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   In the '20s, you had the same kind of late '20s
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.200]   It was an era of great inventiveness
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.200]   The other things matter
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.200]   So just because we're really great at innovation
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   Isn't going to save us if all these other things are broken
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   It's a wonderful thing
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.200]   But ultimately, we as a society
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.200]   In an aggregate
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.200]   Are spending a lot more money than we're earning
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   So, if we're doing such a good job on that technology
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   Whatever it is
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.200]   Why is that happening?
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   So now when you look at the debt
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.200]   Do you want to own the debt?
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   Do you want to own that?
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.200]   Those who don't want to own it
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.200]   Then you have a financial problem
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.200]   When you have a financial problem
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.200]   At the same time as you have a wealth gap
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.200]   And populism
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   That's a dangerous combination
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.200]   At the same time as you have an external
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   So it's a very risky
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   I'm with you, but
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   - Let me just follow up there
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.200]   So you mentioned populism
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.200]   I mean, I think I have a slightly different definition
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   I don't want to debate semantics with you
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.200]   I think populism is a reaction to the failure of elites
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   So all the people managing our fiscal situation
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   And our foreign policy
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.200]   Who have gotten us into all these industry conflicts
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.200]   Who have debased our currency
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.200]   I see populism as people rising up to reject their leadership
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.200]   Now it's a bad thing
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.200]   That they're not willing to accept the results of the election
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.200]   - I agree with your definition
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.200]   And then also
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.200]   At the same time that that's happening
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   They'll win it all, of course
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   They won't compromise
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.200]   They will win
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   They will fight for that side and win
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.200]   - Fair enough, and that's not good
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.200]   I guess my question is
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.200]   Why don't you have more criticism for our elites
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.200]   Who are running all these institutions
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.200]   Who are making these decisions
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.200]   - I do
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.200]   [Applause]
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.200]   I wrote a piece about four years ago
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   Which says
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.200]   Why and how capitalism needs to be reformed
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.200]   And I believe
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.200]   That on these issues
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.200]   Of equal opportunity
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.200]   We've got a big structural problem
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.200]   And that
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.200]   Everything needs to be reformed
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.200]   I'm not against capitalism, but it needs to be reformed
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.200]   And part of the big problem
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.200]   Just analytically, mechanically
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.200]   Is that
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.200]   The profit system alone
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   Does not
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.200]   Direct resources adequately
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.200]   Let's say if we take
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   Climate, for example
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.200]   There is costs
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   Terrible costs that come from climate
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.200]   It's not built into the system
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.200]   Education
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.200]   Look at the gaps in education
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.200]   The structural system
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.200]   Means that the central government
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.200]   That state government
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   Controls education
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.200]   Then you get to the town
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   And at the town level, it's the town that controls the education
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.200]   And how much they pay
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.200]   And so then you create wealth gaps
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.200]   With rich people being able to take care of their kids
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.200]   In a way that other people can't take care of their kids
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.200]   And that creates an opportunity gap
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.200]   That's a structural problem
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.200]   It has to be taken on full
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.200]   Looked at, reformed
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.200]   And in order to pull this thing off
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.200]   We have to do it together
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.200]   Okay, we cannot do it
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   With one side fighting the other side
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.200]   With irreconcilable differences
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   -Ray, before we run out of time
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   Amazingly well said
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.200]   And what an amazing conversation
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.200]   If we were to get prescriptive here
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.200]   In the last couple of minutes we have
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.200]   If America wants to
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.200]   Have a more
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.200]   If America wants to
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   Continue to be the leader
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.200]   Or at least in a lead position here
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.200]   In the free world
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.200]   What should we focus on?
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   What would you say are the top three things?
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.200]   -Let me add one question to that
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.200]   And it connects these two
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.200]   Is there a political solution
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.200]   In the US to avoid the
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   End of empire?
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.200]   Or is it a function of physics?
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.200]   And I think this is a big part of
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.200]   Like Sax's point of view
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.200]   Is there a political solution?
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.200]   We need to change these people
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   Or are there too many, call it
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   Conflating forces, social forces, economic forces
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   That all kind of rise and fall together
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   And it becomes an inevitability
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.200]   That there's a side point
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.200]   -There are pre-existing conditions
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.200]   That represent challenges
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   So for example
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.200]   The amount of debt that we're in
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   Represents a
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   You can't pretend it
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.200]   It exists
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   It represents a challenge
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.200]   There are a lot of these challenges
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.200]   But it is not inevitable
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.200]   What is needed is
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.200]   First of all, a strong middle
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.200]   To bring the country together
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.200]   In terms of rather than
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.200]   To have this fighting
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.200]   Because if we continue the way we will
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.200]   We're going to have a conflict
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.200]   And then there needs to be a good engineering exercise
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.200]   That's going to produce
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.200]   But has to be bipartisan
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.200]   Has to be bipartisan
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.200]   And that strong middle
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.200]   Taking control of the extremes
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.200]   Because neither side is going to win
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.200]   -A great reformation
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.200]   -And that reformation
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.200]   I think should take the form of
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   If I was president of the United States
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   What I would do is
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.200]   -It's on the table
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.200]   -Bipartisan cabinet
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.200]   I'm not running for president
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.200]   But a bipartisan cabinet
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.200]   Bipartisan cabinet
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.200]   And then have
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   An engineering exercise
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   Much like the Manhattan Project
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   In which those bipartisan people
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.200]   Get together
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.200]   And properly engineer
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.200]   Important changes that need to be made
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.200]   They have to be structural
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   We will not agree with each other
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.200]   Ever
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.200]   We're going to kill each other
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.200]   Fighting over these things
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.200]   So structural changes have to be made
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   And you need to have
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.200]   The country as a whole do those things
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.200]   -Do you guys think that's naive
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.200]   Or is it feasible?
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.200]   -I think that the way politics works
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.200]   Is that you don't somehow
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.200]   Come together in the middle
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.200]   I think one side has to win
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.200]   In the eyes of voters
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.200]   Voters have to choose a path
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.200]   -And that's
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.200]   I'm with you, that's what's going to happen
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.200]   -We've had moderate stuff
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.200]   -We're going to have an interesting two years
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.200]   Between where we are now
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.200]   And let's say
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.200]   Almost two years
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.200]   And let's say early
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   2025
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.200]   Okay?
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.200]   And not just interesting because
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.200]   We're going to have unbelievable elections
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   And we'll see how power
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.200]   How we can come together
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.200]   We're going to have an interesting
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.200]   On how China-US relations are
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   We're going to have an interesting
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.200]   Financial conflict
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   And we're going to have radical technology changes
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   Plus climate's going to be an issue
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.200]   So
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   -Ray, you've, Mr. Dalio
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   -Right
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.200]   -You've accomplished more than
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.200]   Anybody could ever expect in life
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.200]   Financially with your company
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.200]   And intellectually
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   Obviously you've given this
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.200]   Tremendous amount of thought
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.200]   And you said you're not running for president
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.200]   I wonder, there's not much time left
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   You should
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.200]   Maybe consider running for president
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.200]   And why not do it?
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.200]   Why not?
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   What's the argument
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.200]   To be so successful, so rich
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.200]   So intellectually curious
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.200]   And not do what the country
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.200]   Needs you to do
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.200]   Which is get in the arena
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   We need you, Mr. Dalio
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   Get in the arena
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.200]   Who wants him in the arena?
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   Let's go
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.200]   -Thank you
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.200]   -This is the same speech
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.200]   -I'm very confident
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.200]   -That's a very nice
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.200]   And generous compliment, thank you very much
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.200]   -Seriously, on a personal level
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.200]   Take me through it
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   -Well, okay
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.200]   Mario Draghi
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.200]   I would give up my life for the country
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.200]   -Okay
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.200]   -But Mario Draghi
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.200]   In Italy, if you know the story
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.200]   He knows
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.200]   The system and how it works
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.200]   And that if you don't have
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.200]   Unitedness
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.200]   And operating in that way
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.200]   Everybody's going to be
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.200]   Torn apart
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.200]   And so I think
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.200]   Whatever thoughts I have
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   If these are helpful thoughts
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.200]   I think my best role is to pass along
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.200]   Whatever helpful thoughts I have
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   And then the population as a whole
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.200]   Deals with those thoughts
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.200]   So I'm making my best contribution
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   That I can, I feel
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.200]   That's my best capacity
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.200]   And then it's up to the people
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.200]   Please join me in thanking Ray Dalio
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.200]   For his contribution
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.200]   -Amazing, give it up
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.200]   That was incredible
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.200]   Thank you Mr. Dalio

[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.200]   -Let your winners ride
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   -Rainman David Sack
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.200]   -Thank you
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.200]   -And instead
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.200]   -I'm going to endorse it to the fans
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.200]   And they've just gone crazy with it
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   -I'm the queen of Kinwani
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.200]   -Let your winners ride
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.200]   Let your winners ride
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.200]   Let your winners ride
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.200]   -Besties are gone
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   -That's my dog taking a notice
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.200]   In your driveway
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.200]   -Oh man
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   -My half a dash or we'll meet
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.200]   -We should all just get a room
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.200]   And just have one big huge orgy
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.200]   It's like sexual tension
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   -We need to release that now
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.200]   -Let your beat be
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.200]   Let your beat be
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.200]   -We need to get
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.200]   -Besties are gone
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.200]   -I'm going all in
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   I'm going all in
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.200]   I'm fallin' in.
