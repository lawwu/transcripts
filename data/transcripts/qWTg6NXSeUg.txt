[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   So today I want to talk about one of the most controversial and complicated topics in our
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.760]   broader discussion of cultivating depth in a world of digital distractions, and that
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.480]   is our good friend and longtime foe, email.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.400]   I want to do something a little bit different today.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.620]   Instead of looking at our current relationship with this tool, I want to instead look into
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.780]   its distant past to help identify some creative new ideas for how we might fix our relationship
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.120]   with email in the future.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.420]   This is a fascinating journey.
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.240]   I've been rabbit-holing on the story of the history of email.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.360]   This is a story that's going to bring us back to a time when the word "internet" was not
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.440]   even in wide circulation yet, and when electronic communication was still a novelty.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.020]   All right, but to set up this whole discussion, this sort of looking back at the history of
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.680]   email to get new ideas about how to be more focused in the future, I want to go back much
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.920]   farther than the introduction of digital networks.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.280]   Believe it or not, Jesse, I want to go all the way back to the time of the dinosaurs.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.360]   So I don't know, you're probably not a dinosaur guy, Jesse, but if you are, we'll find out
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.360]   soon.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.840]   Have you ever heard of the K-T boundary?
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.840]   No.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.480]   All right, this is sort of dinosaur geekdom.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.680]   I think it's cool though.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.360]   The K-T boundary, and I believe this represents the boundary between the Cretaceous and the
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.560]   tertiary geological periods, was this dividing line in the fossil record.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.240]   You can look as you dig down deeper through the surface of the earth, you see these different
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.000]   geological eras the deeper you go.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.320]   There's this dividing line between the Cretaceous and the tertiary period, and please, I know
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.880]   we don't use the word "tertiary" anymore, they call it the Paleogene, and they now call
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.260]   this the K-Pg layer, but I'm going to call it the K-T boundary, just like I insist on
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.320]   calling X Twitter.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.120]   There's this dividing line, below it, dinosaurs, above it, no dinosaurs.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.000]   So we have all these fossils of dinosaurs, 100 million years, and then suddenly no fossils
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.400]   of dinosaurs, and that boundary they call the K-T boundary.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.320]   So this is what led paleontologists to suspect maybe something happened to the dinosaurs,
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.320]   right?
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.440]   Like they're here and then they're gone.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.040]   They got a lot more evidence for what that was when we got better tools and realized,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.880]   "Hey, wait a second, between these two parts of the fossil record, at this K-T boundary,
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.480]   we can find wherever we dig around the world, this really thin, like the thickness of a
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.200]   pencil layer of ash that's full of iridium, which is the stuff that gets blown into the
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.120]   atmosphere when a giant asteroid would hit the earth."
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.860]   And then we looked around and said, "Hey, guess what?
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.800]   Over by the Yucatan Peninsula, there's a giant asteroid crater."
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.080]   And we sort of figured out like, "Oh, probably an asteroid fell and killed the dinosaurs."
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.060]   The thing is, we didn't know much about that actual event.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.360]   We see dinosaurs before it.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.880]   We see no dinosaurs after it.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.520]   It's an age of small mammals that evolved with the humans.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.360]   We didn't know much about the actual event until this really interesting find happened
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.320]   around 2013.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.780]   And this whole story, I mean, look, I'm not a dinosaur guy, but this whole story caught
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.780]   my attention.
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.280]   I'm even going to bring this article that told the story up on the screen here.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.680]   It's a 2019 Douglas Preston article from the New Yorker.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.360]   Douglas Preston is a novelist, a thriller writer, who also is a scientist, and he writes
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.560]   about science sometimes with the New Yorker.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.840]   It's just like out of his books what happened here.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.040]   And I mean that literally, because Preston wrote this book called Tyrannosaur Canyon,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.680]   which I read and enjoyed years ago.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:46.400]   And it was about finding a fossil of a tyrannosaur from the asteroid impact at the K-T boundary.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.160]   So a tyrannosaur dying from the asteroid impact got fossilized.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.240]   The whole book was about that.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.720]   So anyways, Douglas Preston, 2013, gets a call.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.760]   It's from a, well, I guess an email, but it sounds better if it's a call, from a graduate
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.880]   student named Robert De Palma.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.160]   De Palma said basically, "I read Tyrannosaur Canyon.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.240]   We found that."
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.140]   Over in the Hell Creek Formation, "I think we just found fossilized dinosaurs from the
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.200]   day the asteroid hit."
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.880]   This became the seismic, if you'll excuse the double use of the term here, a seismic
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.880]   discovery.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.880]   Here's the actual paper.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.480]   I'll load that on the screen here.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.680]   It was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.800]   Its name was slightly less catchy than Tyrannosaur Canyon.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.760]   It was instead, "A seismically induced onshore surge deposit at the K-Pg boundary, North
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.620]   Dakota."
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.760]   Not that exciting, but a fantastically important paper.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.620]   And they talked about finding fossils from the day the asteroid hit.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.440]   And by studying these fossils, they actually came up with some really interesting insights
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.080]   into what this transition was like, this abrupt transition from dinosaurs to no dinosaurs.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.880]   One of the things they figured out, for example, by looking at the spherical ejecta in the
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.280]   stomach and lungs of fossilized fish from this day that they found on this site, is
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:20.760]   that the asteroid created something called, I'm going to pronounce this wrong, Seiche.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.480]   So if you think about a tsunami as being bad, a Seiche is where a giant body of water, like
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.140]   in a bathtub, just keeps going up and down, right?
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.280]   So the asteroid hits and the ocean basically must have been going vroom, vroom, vroom.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.640]   So just tsunami after tsunami after tsunami.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.680]   So they learned a lot about this event, like what actually happened at the K-T boundary.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.680]   All right.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.720]   So what does this have to do with email?
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:54.360]   Well, I feel like I recently came across an artifact in the technological history of the
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.040]   office that is not unlike that discovery of the Hellkeek Formation that captured that
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.360]   sort of moment when the dinosaurs went extinct and a new type of life emerged, right?
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.640]   So we know there's this boundary in technological history.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.080]   We have a K-T boundary.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.080]   There's no email.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.080]   There's no email.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   There's no email.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.160]   Oh my God, everyone has email, right?
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:22.120]   So we have this boundary in our digital artifact record, but what about that moment where this
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.120]   change happened?
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.480]   What can we learn by looking at the very first moments at which email actually entered life?
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:34.540]   And I found a really cool technological equivalent of a Tyrannosaur that was fossilized at the
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.440]   day the asteroid hit.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.840]   That is an article from the New Yorker.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.680]   I'm going to bring this on the page here, remarkable article from the New Yorker.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.720]   It's sort of famous among New Yorker people, from John Seabrook from 1993, and it's called
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.880]   Email from Bill, Bill Gates' Vision for the Future, all right?
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.140]   A classic profile from 1993 that's going to be our look into this digital equivalent of
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.800]   the asteroid hitting the office.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.660]   So here's the point about this article.
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.660]   It's long.
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.600]   This is essentially the New Yorker's introduction of Bill Gates to its readership.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.760]   I mean, Bill Gates was certainly known in 1993, but young enough, he was 38 then, that
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.440]   the New Yorker hadn't yet done its sort of big profile that gets into, here's where he
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.920]   was born, and here's where he came from, and here was his first company, and here's what
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.720]   Microsoft is doing, and here's Microsoft's plans.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.020]   This wasn't yet something everyone knew.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.940]   The New Yorker was introducing him to the world.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.940]   Interesting side note, Jesse.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.080]   I've actually, I don't think he knows this.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.900]   I've been to John Seabrook's loft, somewhere in lower Manhattan.
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:50.220]   My uncle, he was throwing a book launch party for my uncle when I was in high school.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.020]   My uncle invited my dad, and I was really into writing, so my dad said, "Oh, you should
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.020]   come along.
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.020]   This will be cool to see."
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.640]   So I don't think John knows it, but-
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.160]   The writing loft or where he lives?
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160]   No, just where he lives.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   So there we go.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   I've been to his apartment.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160]   Around this time, well, a little bit after this time, but kind of around this time.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.160]   All right.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.880]   So it's a fantastic, amazing look into this period where the New Yorker was introducing
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.040]   the world.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.260]   Here is Bill Gates.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:18.120]   So Bill Gates had just hit number one the year before on Forbes' most wealthy American
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.120]   list, and then dropped to number two this year to Buffett.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.160]   His fortune was about 6.1 billion.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.680]   He's 38 years old.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.560]   Here is the description of Gates and Microsoft from early in this article.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.200]   I'm just setting the context of what was going on in the world at the time.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.960]   Gates controls the computer industry to an extent matched by no other person in any other
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.420]   major industry.
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.200]   The Justice Department is currently trying to determine whether his control constitutes
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.940]   a monopoly.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:49.480]   Microsoft now supplies 80% of all the personal computer operating system software in the
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.840]   world and 50% of all of the application software.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.840]   Can you believe that?
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.640]   80% of the operating systems, 50% of all the software running on computers.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.500]   This one 38-year-old's company supplied it.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.500]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.500]   He ruled the world.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.500]   Right.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.500]   This was the company.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.500]   This was the tech company.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.960]   A couple other things I noticed before we get into the key observation from this article,
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.880]   no internet.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.860]   So John Seabrook makes the editorial decision throughout this article to keep referring
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.380]   to the quote information superhighway.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.060]   The word internet is never used.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.060]   Right.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.180]   So this is this time the internet was not yet something that the public was very aware
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.180]   of.
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:37.780]   So if you looked up the timeline, actually, the mosaic web browser had been introduced
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.540]   that year.
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.380]   So this was the first web browser coming out of the University of Illinois Supercomputing
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.380]   Center.
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:50.580]   Hey there, I want to take a quick moment to tell you about my new book, Slow Productivity,
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.100]   the Lost Art of Accomplishment without Burnout.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.100]   If you like the type of things I talk about on this channel, you're really going to like
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.480]   this book.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:06.860]   It distills all of my ideas into a clear philosophy combined with step by step instructions for
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.320]   putting it into action.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:15.220]   Now if you pre-order this book before it comes out on March 5th, I have some bonuses I want
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.840]   to offer you as my way of saying thanks.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:25.540]   These include a chapter by chapter audio commentary from me, the author, and a crash course that
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:30.620]   will teach you how to put the ideas of slow productivity into action in your own life
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.360]   right away.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.520]   So to find out more about the book and how to redeem your pre-order bonuses, check out

[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.000]   Everything you need, you can find there.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   All right, thanks.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.280]   Let's get back to it.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.920]   Worked on by a young graduate student at Illinois, University of Illinois, worked in the supercomputer
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.820]   center named Mark Engreson.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.900]   The next year Netscape would come out, which was the first version of this that was aimed
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.000]   for the average person to use.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.560]   So we didn't really have the web used yet.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.000]   The internet was around, but it was mainly being used by academic and research institutions.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.760]   So we don't even use that word yet.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:17.520]   You'll notice Seabrook will use the same term, information superhighway, for referring to
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.720]   what we would now think of internet communications.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:25.860]   He also uses it for thinking about internal digital communications within an organization.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.900]   All of this was sort of mysterious back then.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:33.540]   It was, I don't know, there's just these roads that are made of information and messages
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.960]   drive on them.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.140]   So clearly it wasn't something we really understood.
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:43.340]   And I'm emphasizing this, so all the things we take for granted about digital communication
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.380]   and how that works, none of this was known back then.
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.380]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.060]   I'm really trying to hone in at exactly this period where email emerges.
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.140]   Another interesting vision of the future from this article, I mean, I love rabbit holing
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.460]   back to these past periods.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:06.980]   The vision Seabrook documents, the vision Gates had for the internet was clearly this
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.080]   is going to be controlled through TVs.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.260]   That was the vision in 1993.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.980]   Let me read from the article here.
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.660]   The new machine that they're working on will be a communication device that connects people
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.580]   to the information highway.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:26.500]   It will penetrate far beyond the 15% of American households that now own a computer and it
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:32.220]   will control or absorb other communication machines now in people's homes, the phone,
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.660]   the fax, the television.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.720]   It will sit in the living room, not in the study.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.260]   The problem of getting people to feel comfortable with such a powerful machine will be partly
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.700]   solved by putting it inside of one of the most unobtrusive objects in the house, the
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:52.300]   set top converter, which is a featureless black box on top of a cable connected TV set.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:58.380]   They could not imagine a world in which yet just most people had computers, laptops, regular
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.340]   computers or smartphones and connected to the internet through those machines.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.940]   They were still thinking we're going to have a cable box that can send faxes.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.980]   And again, I'm trying to set the scene in '93.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:15.620]   If we're going to use our analogy to paleontology, dinosaurs are still everywhere, right?
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.060]   No one was thinking about mammals, think about mammals yet.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.340]   All right.
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.440]   So why is this interesting?
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.900]   Because what is the, the core behavior that Seabrook uses to try to capture what's so
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.700]   new and interesting and different about Bill Gates and Microsoft?
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.860]   Like what's his, they say in like editorial circles at the New Yorker, your acute way
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.140]   in to the subject, right?
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:42.220]   I just learned this from my editor the other day, the word profile, which was probably
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.400]   coined by Harold Ross, the founding editor of the New Yorker.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.620]   It's actually referring to, when you look at someone in the profile of someone, you're
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.180]   looking at them from the sides, you're kind of getting at someone from the side.
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.040]   What was the thing, the weird eccentric attention catching thing about Bill Gates that John
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.160]   Seabrook uses as entrance into this article?
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.460]   The fact that he used email.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:09.380]   So email had just arrived at Microsoft at the time that John Seabrook was writing this
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.320]   really epic profile of Bill Gates.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:20.220]   So the article opens with John Seabrook, emailing Bill Gates on a whim, BillG@Microsoft.com.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:26.240]   Gates answers, Seabrook and Gates begin sending emails back and forth about three or four
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.240]   times a week.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.180]   Here's some quotes John Seabrook describing using email, which was clearly pretty new
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.560]   to him.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.400]   You can do a little sleuthing in this article because he actually shows for some reason,
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.680]   because this was also novel, Seabrook actually shows the headers of one of these email messages,
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.680]   the routing headers.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.660]   So you can find out that Seabrook was using CompuServe at the time.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.440]   Here's some quotes from the article about email at this early period.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.400]   We were intimate in a curious way, in the sense of being wired into each other's minds,
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.220]   but our contact was elaborately stylized, like ballroom dancing.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.960]   In some ways, my email relationship with Bill was like an ongoing month-long conversation,
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.040]   except for there was a pause after each response to think.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.320]   Here's another quote from the article.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.800]   Another advantage Bill Gates has is that he already lives on the information highway.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.400]   I love this use of information highway.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.360]   The thing, and I have empathy for John Seabrook about this, he was probably like six months
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.680]   away, just in our cultural timeline, from the internet just becoming like a really common
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.680]   term.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.760]   So probably like as this article was being fact-checked, he was like, "Oh no, there's
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.200]   another term, internet, oh God."
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   Anyways.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:42.680]   New employees at Microsoft are likely to encounter Bill Gates electronically long before they
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.880]   meet him in person.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:51.000]   Some get to thinking of him by his email handle, which is Bill G, rather than by his real name.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.840]   They'll be chatting with a Microsoft employee in the employee's office.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.200]   The computer will make a little belch or squeak, indicating an incoming piece of electronic
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.380]   mail, and it will be an email from Bill.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.400]   It's not unusual to hear a young employee say, "Hey, that's a good idea.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.400]   I'm going to email Bill about that."
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.720]   Here's another observation about email at Microsoft.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.840]   Gates spends at least two hours a day at his desk, staring into his monitor, reading and
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.640]   writing email.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.480]   Email allows Gates to run the company in his head, in a sense.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.080]   I want to pause there for a moment.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.400]   This is really important.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.960]   This is this Hell Creek Formation analogy in the digital world.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:40.600]   Email arrives in this super fast-moving, super high-tech, king of the tech companies, tech
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.200]   just emerging in the '90s as the sector.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.760]   They get email, and how is it deployed?
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:53.400]   Well, it's a reflection of Bill Gates, hyper-smart, rocking, keeping a hundred things in his head
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.120]   all at one point.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.600]   It's a reflection, almost an immediate reflection, of his cognitive reality.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.940]   Email becomes, "Let's just rock and roll.
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.080]   It's an intimate relationship.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.480]   I'm running the company in my head.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.880]   Anyone can talk to me at any time.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.640]   I get a sense of what's going on."
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.320]   This became a well-known idea for a few years, this idea that you could just email Bill Gates
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.720]   and he would write you back.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:23.120]   This tool is introduced into this company, and immediately its usage becomes a reflection
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.640]   of the personality of the most important person in the tech industry, which is Bill Gates.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:33.240]   Now, what's important to emphasize is this is very specific to what's happening at Microsoft.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.920]   There's this key passage where Seabrook says, "Look, most companies aren't like this."
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.920]   This is what I'm talking about.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.120]   We're at that boundary, the no-email-email boundary.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.760]   Seabrook looks to another company just as a comparison that is in Seattle.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:53.000]   It's Macaw Cellular Communications, another high-tech company nearby.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.440]   Here's how Seabrook describes it.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.500]   Over at Macaw Cellular Communications, another prominent high-tech company whose headquarters
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:06.920]   is a few miles from Microsoft's, phones ring all the time and everyone wears a beeper.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:13.240]   Seabrook is capturing, like Microsoft is ground zero right now of this email revolution.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.520]   And immediately we get this sort of hyperactive hive mind.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.760]   We're all connected to each other.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.840]   Let's just send messages back and forth.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.800]   Here's Seabrook giving a number.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.880]   As in all the Microsoft offices, one rarely hears the sound of a ringing phone.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:33.880]   The employees send a total of 200 million email messages to each other every month.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.480]   Now I will point out there's no way that number is correct.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.840]   Because I'm a nerd, Jesse, I went and did some research on this.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:47.560]   I looked up the, from SEC filings, the total employees at Microsoft in 1993.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.240]   If you divide 200 million emails by the total number of employees, it works out to about
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.400]   13,000 emails per employee per month.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.240]   I think he has an extra zero.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.240]   In fact he-
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.240]   That's so good.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:06.440]   I think he, I think he meant 20 million, but look, I know a lot about email usage statistics.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440]   That would be great.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.320]   If there's 13,000 a month, I mean, if you do the math, I mean, it's like hundreds and
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.320]   hundreds of emails a day.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.600]   I mean, it's possible, but whatever.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.960]   They were using a lot of it.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.960]   Other high-tech companies weren't.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.960]   So this is ground zero of this happening.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:23.320]   I want to give one more quote before we analyze this deeper.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:29.900]   So I'm arguing that in part, this hyperactive, let's all just get this ongoing conversation
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.160]   going.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.000]   Usage of emails in part, a reflection of Bill Gates.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.840]   Seabrook argues it's also in part a reflection of the industry itself, right?
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:45.840]   So he says the platonic nature of software, it is invisible, weightless and odorless.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:52.120]   It doesn't exist in the physical world, determines much of the culture that surrounds it.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.520]   At Microsoft workers often describe each other as smart or super smart, or one of the smartest
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.120]   people you'll meet around here.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.120]   All right.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.160]   So we have this culture where it's all abstraction.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.620]   It's digital bits that exist somewhere.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:10.040]   And what matters is cognition, manipulating bits with your mind and how good are you doing
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.040]   that?
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.640]   So it's just natural if that's the environment in which this otherwise pretty bland tool,
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.480]   it's a protocol for sending ASCII text characters through some sort of common MIME formatting
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.520]   scheme back and forth between computers and storing it asynchronously.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.680]   If that's the environment in which this bland tool emerges, we're going to be like, yeah,
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.680]   it's a hive mind.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.680]   Let's, let's go.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   Everyone connect to everyone.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.760]   Let's move information around as fast as we can.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.200]   It's going to make us smarter.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.240]   It's all about smarts and speed, and it's all abstract and digital anyways.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.600]   And now our communication exists in this digital weightless, odorless ether, just like the
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.320]   bits of which we're programming.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.700]   Let's just meld it all together.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.480]   And Bill Gates wants to be at the center of this hive mind, almost just intuitively knowing
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.160]   everything that's going on and pushing it.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.480]   He was a control, you know, a control addict.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.800]   He wanted to have his hands in all parts of Microsoft.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.320]   He was a leader, a completely hands-on leader.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:11.120]   So it really makes sense that this would be the way in Microsoft that email spread.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.760]   So here's what happened.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.620]   This became how everyone else started using email too.
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.040]   So we get these early adopters in the tech industry like Microsoft, and we have this
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.920]   remarkable snapshot of what it was like when it comes there.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.760]   And they immediately start using this as an extension of their brilliant brains and the
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.360]   hive mind, everyone together, and they love speed and moving quick.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:35.240]   And this is a big part of that metaphorical approach to business.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.640]   So then when this tool spreads, it's not just the technology spreading, it's the culture
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.000]   that spreads as well.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.400]   Hey, here's this cool tool being used at places like Microsoft.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   Here's how they use it.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   We want to be like Microsoft.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.320]   We're going to do this too.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:54.320]   Just like how Silicon Valley companies in the 2010s began shifting over to open office
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:59.080]   formats for reasons that were very specific to Silicon Valley, they were signaling disruption
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.920]   to investors and potential employees.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.640]   And later in the 2010s, you get companies that had no business having open offices doing
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.080]   the same thing.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   It's the culture and the physical change would spread.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:19.220]   I remember doing a talk right before the pandemic at a big, I think a healthcare company.
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.000]   There's no reason for them to have these big open offices and all the people I talked to
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.680]   really hated it, but it just, the culture spreads with the tool.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.800]   And that's how we ended up where we are now.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.360]   And where we ended up almost immediately by the end of the 90s, email is about supporting
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.220]   a digital hive mind, quick, low friction communication.
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.780]   More is better than less because more information is better than less information.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.060]   It lets us move faster.
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.060]   Faster is good.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.060]   It makes us smarter.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.060]   Smart is good.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.500]   Sin, sin, sin, sin, sin.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.640]   And so that was the evolution of this tool.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.840]   After we got past our digital KT boundary, of course, the problem with this is it doesn't
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   scale.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.840]   Yes.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.580]   In 1993, Bill Gates was emailing all of his employees.
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.800]   You could email him, get an answer.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   You're a reporter.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   You could email them.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   He would answer back.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   Spoiler alert.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.560]   What would happen if I emailed billg@microsoft.com right now?
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.680]   Of course, he's not going to answer.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:16.500]   Of course, when he was the CEO later in the nineties and into the early two thousands,
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.660]   you couldn't just easily email Bill Gates.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.900]   It doesn't scale.
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.140]   It's too much communication.
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.700]   He was already spending two hours a day just trying to manage it when the tool was new
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.600]   and most people weren't still using it.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.660]   And of course, by today, that's just way too many messages.
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.780]   And what ends up happening, and this is a core argument I've made many times on the
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.980]   show, I've written a whole book about this called the world without email.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.200]   What ends up happening is if you're going to have a hive mind, you're going to have
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.580]   a lot of ongoing communication threads.
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:47.620]   Those communication threads are going to require back and forth information and it's asynchronous.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.220]   You don't know when the next message in this thread is going to arrive, but when it does,
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.540]   you have to answer pretty quickly because you have to keep this back and forth going
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.060]   if you're going to reach any sort of conclusion in a reasonable amount of time.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.700]   So what does this require?
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.300]   Constantly checking your inboxes.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.700]   We could probably capture that best.
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.140]   I always go back to the same chart.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.900]   I'm going to load it on the screen here for people who are watching.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.060]   This chart on the screen shows exactly where we end up.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.260]   When you start scaling up the hive mind, this is the histogram from the rescue time data
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.860]   set of the average time between checking email or instant messaging services.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:25.580]   That medium average gap between checking email among the tens of thousands of people studied
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.720]   here was six minutes.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.740]   The most common, if we look at this histogram, the most common gap between checking email
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.700]   of the tens of thousands of people studied, one minute.
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:40.820]   That's what happens when you want to maintain a constant ongoing conversation with a lot
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.060]   of different people is you have to service those conversations.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.880]   If you don't, things get bottlenecked and slow down and there's problems.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.540]   And so now we have to be constantly checking these things.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.180]   Unfortunately, our brain cannot constantly check email or chat channels where every single
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.920]   message is from a completely different context than the message before.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:04.380]   And also suspect to write good computer code or also expect to make good management decisions
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.580]   or also expect to be making research breakthroughs or to write a report in a way that's sensical
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:10.580]   and smart.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.460]   We can't do both.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.460]   So we're overloaded.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.780]   We're burnt out and we're miserable.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:21.140]   All of that goes back to this moment when this tool was introduced and Bill Gates said,
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.620]   this is great.
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.300]   I want to talk to people as fast as possible.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.140]   So there's alternative timelines here, right?
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.500]   Like, I mean, let's imagine just like people say, let's rewind the clock to the asteroid
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.340]   hitting at the Cretaceous tertiary boundary.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.220]   The first time it happened, mammals made their move.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.020]   But you know, if we rerun the clock, we might've seen different outcomes.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.540]   I think the same is true with email.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:48.140]   Imagine for example, if for some reason, McCraw Communications, the place with all the beepers,
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.420]   what if they were the first to get email and not this, you know, super darling of the high
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:55.500]   tech industry like Microsoft led by such an iconic class like Bill Gates, it might've
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.500]   been different.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.580]   Here are different ways that email might've been integrated as a tool in an alternative
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.220]   timeline of this transition.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:07.020]   It might've first emerged for example, as a digital fax machine.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.900]   Yeah, your email addresses are like fax machine numbers.
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.020]   Each team in the office has it.
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.180]   You use it to deliver documents and files.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.180]   This is great.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.180]   We don't have to fax it.
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:22.820]   We can just email the memo to the fax machine address for the marketing department.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:28.600]   That is a completely sensical use of this asynchronous messaging format.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.180]   Just happens not to be the one that first emerged.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.740]   Here's another one, digital mailboxes.
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:38.340]   So another way that email could have been integrated into work cultures is it could
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:42.300]   have been a digital equivalent of the mail room.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:49.560]   Like yeah, we have a digital mailbox and maybe you check once a day, like a real email box,
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.180]   like a real actual physical mailbox.
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.460]   Maybe there's like a special machine you go to.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.340]   Like let me see what's in my mailbox.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.340]   And it's digital.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.300]   So like it saves having to have people transfer papers around.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.300]   Right.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.340]   So you could have had a whole culture emerge around this that says this is a digital version
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.340]   of our mailbox.
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.660]   I want you to check that.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.660]   You check your physical mailbox once a day anyways, in the office, it'll be about the
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.660]   same.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.700]   In fact, maybe you could imagine alternative timeline where there is a computer in the
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.240]   mail room.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.300]   Let me check my physical mailbox and let me see if anyone sent me any digital mail and
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:23.500]   hey, there's a printer here and I can print anything I think I need to print.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.940]   A completely sensical application of these underlying protocols, but it's not how it
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.220]   happened.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:34.660]   Another timeline could have been imagined instead, email first emerged in a place that
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.600]   was more hierarchical.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.220]   So not the sort of, hey, Bill Gates, everyone knows me, I'm talking to everyone, it's all
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.220]   about smarts.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:47.800]   But let's say it arose in an old conservative blue chip firm that was very hierarchical.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.140]   You could have easily imagined there that these protocols say, great, this is a tool
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.340]   for assistance.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:59.860]   Students can use this in the background as part of how they help execute whatever it
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.540]   is to support they're trying to provide.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:06.740]   So now they have another tool just like they might have, for example, at this period, the
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.380]   variable speed dictation machines.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:15.020]   Kids don't know about these, but before there was computers, most people couldn't type.
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.040]   You had dedicated typers.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.220]   You would write things by hand or record it.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:25.100]   And then other people would type it for you, professional typers who are much faster.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.660]   And if you recorded it, so a lot of people were recording memos and reports, talking
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:35.380]   into a microphone, the typers would play back these recordings and type along and they had
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:41.780]   a foot pedal and you could use the foot pedal to control the speed of the playback.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.420]   So you could kind of slow it down and then speed it up and slow it down, like slow it
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.020]   down when you're saying something really precise.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:51.700]   So you could have imagined an alternative timeline, the email arising in one of these
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.260]   hierarchical places that really depends on support staff.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.260]   They'd be like, great, this is like the foot pedal for dictation.
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:01.580]   Another tool the support staff has, but the person like doing the financials or writing
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.500]   the report or coming up with the marketing campaigns, well, why would they need to know
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.780]   about that?
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.660]   All sorts of different alternative timelines.
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.380]   We fixate on the one that happened, but it doesn't mean it was inevitable.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:16.040]   All right, so what's the general theory at play here?
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   We need to separate the pure functionality of a new technology from how that functionality
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.040]   is applied.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:29.060]   It's an important nuance in how we look at technology.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.500]   We can get pretty deterministic about this.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:37.020]   Yes, email means checking every five minutes and we talk about everything, it's all back
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.020]   and forth.
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:42.780]   That must just be somehow inevitable in the tool.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.120]   So this is sort of a pure, what's called techno-determinist perspective.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.900]   There was no other choice.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.840]   That was what's going to happen when you introduce this tool.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.480]   But often, no, it's more complicated than that.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.380]   The tool has an abstract functionality, like email can deliver messages asynchronously
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.560]   over network and store them until someone's ready to read them.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.460]   And then you have the culture surrounding the tool.
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:10.720]   How do we actually use that tool?
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.320]   It's not set in stone.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:19.160]   Now here is where, and I don't want to get to tech theory here, there's an even more
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.640]   nuanced way to slice this.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:26.440]   The techno-determinists say the tool just dictates exactly how it's going to be used.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.880]   You have another group, Scott, the social construction of technology crowd that says,
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:37.880]   no, no, it's all the culture surrounding the tool, the people in the environment in which
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.400]   the tool is deployed, they determine how it's used.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:47.320]   But the Scott folks tend to give a lot of agency to those people.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.480]   So if email is used this way, there's these alternative timelines.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:55.940]   But if it's used this way, it's because the people involved in controlling how email was
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.800]   first deployed wanted it to be used that way.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.960]   I think the reality is in between those two things.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.120]   So the usage of a tool like email is not built into its digital DNA.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.520]   There's a lot of alternative timelines.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:15.460]   The culture around the tool itself does dictate how that tool is deployed.
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:22.060]   But I often think that that cultural impact is often unintentional and dynamical.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:26.840]   So it comes into Microsoft, Bill Gates doesn't make a decision.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.160]   This is how I want email to use.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.340]   It just sort of emerges from other realities of that culture and how this tool interacts
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.340]   with it.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.780]   There's a lot of pseudo determinism.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.700]   Often in these cases, these new tools come around and how they impact us is hard to predict
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:44.020]   and not intentional, but it's also not ingrained into the tool itself.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.940]   There are alternatives.
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.600]   And so what does this mean for us?
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.980]   This means we should not take as a unavoidable given how a tool is affecting our lives or
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.780]   organizations or communities.
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.240]   It might be hard to steer this at first.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.660]   These tools show up and have unpredictable interactions with where they arrive and they
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.340]   shoot off in some direction.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.300]   And now Microsoft, according to John Seabrook is everyone's sending 13,000 emails a month
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.240]   or whatever, but we can still change that.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.260]   It's hard to predict and it's hard to control where technology first takes us because of
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:23.180]   the pseudo determinism, but we can still change it because the tool itself is not deterministic.
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:28.380]   We can look back, see the impact and say, okay, let's push this on another timeline.
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:34.700]   Now that we've seen which way this went, now we can come back and more systematically say,
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.140]   is there a better way to deploy this tool?
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.180]   Now that we've seen the good and the bad that it reeks when we let it just sort of rock
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.220]   and roll.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:48.300]   This is this philosophy that I call techno selectionism, where you can't predict in advance
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.940]   what things are going to do, but you can, after the fact, come back and try to re-steer
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:52.940]   them.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.260]   And I think we can do that with email.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:00.460]   So this hyperactive hive mind, Bill Gates approach does not have to be how we use this
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.680]   underlying tool.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:07.520]   We can look at and say, given 30 years of experience, what's useful, what's not useful.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.500]   How do we want to redirect it?
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.220]   The dinosaurs can't do this.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.220]   Mammals can't do this.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:16.240]   We can't rewind the clock and say, let's try evolution all over again.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:22.120]   After the asteroid hit, we can do this with technology, which is what's exciting.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:27.060]   So for example, as we're looking now at email, we might say, Bill Gates was wrong about this
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.820]   hive mind approach.
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.380]   It made sense in the moment, it was exciting, but you know what?
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:32.380]   It fries our brain.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.380]   It doesn't scale.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.380]   We can't get anything else done.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.380]   We're all burning out.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.660]   All right, let's stop doing that.
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:42.980]   What if we said instead, email should be for delivering information that doesn't require
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.200]   a reply.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.540]   So like an old fashioned mailbox and for non-time sensitive questions that could be answered
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.140]   with a single message.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.820]   Like that is a really efficient way to use email.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:54.820]   Here's a memo.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.820]   I don't want to print it.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.820]   Great.
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:57.820]   I'm glad it's in my email inbox.
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.440]   I'll read it when I get a chance.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.440]   Here's a question.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.520]   What time are you leaving tomorrow?
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.300]   I don't need to know right away.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.340]   When you get around to it, you can come back and answer it.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.580]   That one message, it's done.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.580]   But we could say, okay, for back and forth communication, we should not have a hive mind
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.320]   over digital because it's the asynchronous, it just means we have to check these things
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.320]   all the time.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.900]   And this leads us to the type of things that I've pitched before.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:25.020]   Like in my book, A World Without Email, have protocols for particular styles of work.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.540]   Here's how we collaborate on this so it's not just messages going back and forth.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.600]   Have office hours.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.820]   You have a one-off question that's going to require a discussion.
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.940]   Come to my next office hours.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.660]   We'll do it real time.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:39.140]   Have things like docket clearing meetings.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.460]   Here's something our team needs to work on you just thought of.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.340]   Don't email it to us.
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.580]   Put it on our docket, a shared document that at our two or three time a week docket clearing
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:53.300]   meetings, we will see as we go through everything together and deal with them one by one.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.860]   We can rewind the clock and rerun digital evolution.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:03.020]   That's what's cool about this particular subject versus other types of evolutions that we face.
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.100]   So email, I mean, it's a cool story, right?
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:10.360]   I mean, it emerged in this unique company, like unique in the world with this unique
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.860]   person leading it.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.220]   And he set the stage for this is how email should be used.
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:18.580]   And the same thing happened in technology companies all across Silicon Valley.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:22.500]   And it changed the whole way we thought about this tool.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.420]   But this way that we thought about the tool turned out to be an evolutionary dead end.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.660]   It's making us miserable.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.340]   It's really almost melting down the knowledge sector in a way we don't quite acknowledge
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.340]   yet.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.620]   So let's just rewind the clock.
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.620]   We can do that.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:39.380]   We can't predict when the asteroid is going to come, but we can keep going back and changing
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:43.180]   based on our own values and humanity, what happens after the impact occurs.
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.100]   So that's a broad point.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:50.660]   But email gives us a specific example of that point in action.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:51.660]   So there we go.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.660]   1993.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.660]   Internet.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.660]   I like that story.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.660]   That was great.
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:56.660]   Information highway.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.660]   I'm going to use that.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.660]   Also email capitalized.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.660]   They still hyphenated.
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.380]   I don't know if they still capitalize email.
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.860]   But in that article, it was email.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.860]   Cool point.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.980]   That's how the web was around.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.660]   People didn't know what the internet was, and then suddenly they knew what the internet
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:14.660]   was.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.580]   It was interesting.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:20.780]   The guy who invented the internet, not the internet, the web, which is the part of the
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:25.980]   internet most people are familiar with, Tim Berners-Lee, he worked on the same floor that
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:26.980]   I did at MIT.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:32.180]   So I'd often take the elevator with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the internet.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.220]   And you know what the name of that building was?
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:37.460]   The William H. Gates, it was the Bill Gates Research Tower.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.140]   So see, it all connects, Jesse.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.140]   It all connects.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.140]   Oh my.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.140]   All right.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.380]   So anyways, we've got a bunch of questions about these type of things, how to use email
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.380]   better.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.300]   But first I want to mention some sponsors.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:58.660]   I'll start with my friends at Mosh, M-O-S-H, which has quickly emerged to be one of my
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:05.820]   favorite protein snack bars because of how they taste, because of what's in them, and
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:12.100]   because of the bigger mission behind the company that creates them.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:16.500]   So the Mosh bars have become one of my favorite go-to things when I don't have time or I'm
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.300]   not interested in eating a whole meal, but I don't want my energy to drop.
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.340]   I want a bunch of protein and not a bunch of junk.
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.980]   Mosh bars have become my favorite.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.380]   They have six delicious flavors.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:32.220]   Each Mosh bar has 12 grams of protein, is made with ingredients that support brain health
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.980]   like Ashwagandha, Lion's Mane Collagen, and Omega-3s.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:41.180]   They also have a whole line of plant-based protein bars that come in three delicious
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.940]   flavors.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:46.900]   What I like about the Mosh bars is they're soft bars, but they have a little bit of crunchy
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:47.900]   elements in them.
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.020]   There's almost like a nutty flavor and there's chocolate and they're just great.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.780]   I mean, I tried a lot of different bars.
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:38:00.500]   My wife brought some back from Costco recently, and I hope she's not listening, but the bar
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:04.460]   she brought back from Costco, it tasted as if you were saying, "Okay, here's what we
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.460]   want to do.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.480]   Give me some Elmer's glue.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.180]   Give me a lot of sand.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.740]   Let's use that glue to connect the sand into a bar form."
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.900]   Having one of those bars made me say, "Where's our Mosh bars?
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:15.900]   We got to reorder."
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:22.340]   Because they taste so much better, but they have all that good stuff and the Omega-3s
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.140]   and the Lion's Mane and the Collagen.
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.940]   So it's the energy you need to think hard.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:31.020]   As I mentioned though, there's also a social cause behind this.
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:35.700]   Mosh is a company founded by Maria Shriver and her son, Patrick Schwarzenegger, has a
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:40.140]   simple mission to create a conversation about brain health through food, education, and
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.140]   research.
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.900]   The thing is Maria's father, Sergeant Shriver, suffered from Alzheimer's, and since then
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.480]   she and Patrick have dedicated themselves to finding ways to help other families dealing
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.180]   with this debilitating disease.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:58.940]   So Mosh donates a portion of all proceeds from your order to a fund for gender-based
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.660]   brain health research through the Women's Alzheimer's Movement.
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.980]   So their push is not only to let's research Alzheimer's, but it affects men and women
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:11.620]   differently and they want to say let's focus specifically on women afflicted by Alzheimer's.
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:17.260]   It's a great cause and a great tasting bar that's good for you and gives you the energy
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.260]   you need.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.260]   I love them.
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.740]   It's much better than the Elmer's glue and sand that you get in a typical protein bar.
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:27.460]   So if you want to find ways to give back to others and fuel your body and your brain,
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.940]   Mosh bars are the perfect choice for you.

[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.100]   Thank you, Mosh, for sponsoring this protocol.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:59.160]   Let's also talk about our friends at Shopify.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:05.260]   Selling a little or a lot, Shopify helps you do your thing however you cha-ching.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:11.420]   It's a type of phrase I say all the time naturally, as Jesse knows.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.740]   I'm constantly rhyming like that.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.620]   Shopify is what you should use if you sell things.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.160]   It is the global commerce platform that helps you sell at every stage of your business from
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:25.860]   a small online shop to a million order a week type business.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.900]   They handle the whole thing.
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.060]   They handle online orders.
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.260]   They handle in-person point of service orders.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:36.260]   It doesn't matter if it's scented soap or outdoor outfits.
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.460]   They are the easiest way to sell things.
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:47.060]   They also have now an AI-powered tool called Shopify Magic to really help you convert more.
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.760]   In fact, they're one of the internet's best converting checkout platforms.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:58.520]   Their checkout for e-commerce has 36% better on average conversion compared to other leading
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.880]   e-commerce platforms.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:05.280]   10% of all e-commerce in the U.S. is powered by Shopify.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.520]   They also have award-winning support.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.120]   If you're selling things, Shopify is who you use.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.120]   It's a shorthand.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.600]   When Jesse and I talk about all of our ideas for what we want to sell, and I don't think
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.520]   we have our killer idea yet.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.460]   We've had a lot of ideas.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.020]   It's like the generic verb we use, like, "Yeah, so we could just Shopify that."
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.020]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.020]   Clearly, that's what we're going to.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:28.800]   In fact, don't we even have, waiting to go, a Shopify account?
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.400]   We set it up for the thing we were thinking about, so we even have it waiting for us just
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.400]   to get the right product.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   Yes, we do.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.740]   That is how obvious it is to us that if and when we have our great product to sell, of
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.380]   course, we're going to use Shopify.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.020]   It just makes everything easier.
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:49.440]   Sign up for a $1 per month trial period at shopify.com/deep, and make sure you spell
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.780]   that all lowercase.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:56.300]   Go to shopify.com/deep now to grow your business no matter what stage you're in.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.300]   That's shopify.com/deep.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:03.500]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.500]   Sounds good.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:05.500]   All right.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:11.340]   We've got a bunch of email, hyperactive hive mind, core questions, nerd questions.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:12.340]   I love it.
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.180]   And to your mosh read, whenever I hear Costco now, I think of that Acquired episode on Costco,
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:22.100]   and then you wrote that piece on Acquired in your newsletter last week.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.100]   Yes.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.700]   And then I heard from one of my students that I taught this summer at Dartmouth when I was
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:30.460]   teaching that writing class, grad student who took my writing about technology class,
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.700]   and he was like, "I'm great friends with those guys.
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.660]   They met at my apartment."
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.660]   Very small world.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:36.660]   Wow.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.660]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:38.660]   Everyone knows everyone.
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.660]   It's a small world.
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:43.500]   I think people of roughly a similar age who podcast are right.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.060]   I mean, how many of us are there?
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.060]   All right.
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.060]   All right.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.060]   First question's from Rachel.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:53.100]   "How can I manage the hyperactive hive mind inside a big government agency?
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.020]   I've attempted to employ your strategies, but it's not working.
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.220]   Should I give up and move back to the private sector?"
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:02.340]   Well, I hope you don't think that's hyperbole, Rachel, but I think the right answer here
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.900]   is coup de tas.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:11.420]   Just overthrow the government, and then you can determine how to be your number one.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.060]   Mussolini made the trains run on time.
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:18.900]   You are going to cut down on unscheduled email messages that have to be responded to.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:24.100]   Honestly, you probably could overthrow a country on that, a country's government on that particular
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.100]   platform.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:30.120]   You know, Rachel, in my book, World Without Email, I open at the intro as an interesting
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:35.000]   case study that you will appreciate about the world of government and email.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:42.020]   And what it profiled was someone, his name was Nish, and he was hired by the Obama administration.
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:47.300]   This was like in 2000, I think second term, second term Obama.
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.540]   And I forgot exactly what he was hired to do.
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:53.540]   It was under one of the cabinet secretaries, some sort of business innovation.
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:57.340]   It was probably under commerce or something like this, but like a typical, here's your
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:03.260]   team, here's your office, you're in charge of innovation strategy for the department
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.380]   of the treasury or something.
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:11.900]   And there's this natural experiment that happened where Nisha arrives in DC to take this job
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.980]   and some virus, like a digital virus, hits the computers.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.660]   And it feels like it's compromised and the security forces come in and say, we got to
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:23.540]   take all your computers basically, because we don't know how far this virus has spread
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.900]   and there's security stuff going on.
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:27.020]   So we're going to take these.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:32.340]   And so you have no way of emailing people and not for like a day.
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.980]   This was six weeks.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:38.820]   So he shows up and almost immediately as a natural experiment, they turn off their email
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.820]   and say, do your jobs.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.100]   You can't have email.
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:45.260]   And the cool thing about this is Nisha, yeah, there was like some, a bunch of annoying stuff.
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:50.620]   Like the main annoying thing was the, the Obama white house had this sort of daily email
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:55.180]   list about like what was going on and they felt out of the loop, but without the ability
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.460]   to send emails, Nisha's like, well, what am I going to do instead?
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:02.500]   Well, I'm going to go visit these various stakeholders relevant to our program.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:07.540]   I'll just go to their offices and we'll, we'll have these like long meetings and just talk
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:08.540]   and think.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.020]   And so he just met people, learned and thought like the way that a government task force
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:17.980]   like this would have been run at any point up until 1995.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.820]   And it was super productive.
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:25.500]   And in those six weeks he came up with all of the insights that they executed, all the
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:29.540]   project ideas they executed for the rest of his time in government service.
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:35.140]   So I feel your pain, this a constant emailing and back and forth.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:42.140]   It makes the small things convenient, but makes the large things that matter very hard.
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:47.940]   So what can you do in this cliche of an organization that of course you can't change, you can't
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.900]   change government bureaucracy.
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.140]   Change the metric you're focusing on.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.140]   Be more specific.
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.440]   You're going to have more success.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:00.520]   So what you're looking at is not really email reduction.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.900]   What you're working at is not, I want less emails in my inbox.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:09.980]   What you're looking at is not, I want better habits around my inbox.
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:16.220]   I want people to be okay with me checking once every three hours.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.220]   That's not it either.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.220]   None of these are what you're looking for.
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:23.900]   What you're actually looking for, the thing that if you counted would give you the number
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:29.540]   you want to make as small as possible is number of unscheduled messages that you have to reply
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.660]   to in a given day.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:35.660]   That is the actual killer, not email, not norms.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.060]   It is messages that arrive unscheduled.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.220]   So it's not like you're anticipating like at this point, this message is coming.
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.360]   That requires a reply from you.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:48.420]   When that number is high, you have to constantly check your inbox because you're probably never
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.220]   far from a message that may have just arrived that you probably need to respond to.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.980]   Because again, this is part of a back and forth chain.
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.420]   And if you don't keep that chain pulling, you're not going to get to a decision before
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.420]   the end of the day.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.820]   And it's a problem.
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.900]   Unscheduled messages that require replies.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:02.900]   That's the killer.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.860]   So now you start thinking, how do I reduce those?
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.560]   And it's not just reducing email and it's not just changing your habits.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.980]   Now it is collaboration systems.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.700]   Oh, I'm collaborating with this person on this.
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:21.740]   The way we're implicitly collaborating now is she just sends things as she thinks of
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.720]   them and we have these conversations in email.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.020]   That's raising my unscheduled messages that require a reply metric.
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.740]   That number is going up because of this collaboration.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.800]   Why don't I think about this particular collaboration?
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.100]   How do we reduce the unscheduled messages?
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.580]   I don't need to talk to the other person about that like this.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:43.020]   I don't need to tell them about Cal and the hyperactive hive mind and Bill Gates and the
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.020]   KT boundary.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:48.380]   I'm just going to put in place an alternative that brings that down.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:50.700]   It's like, okay, Hey, here's what we're going to do.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.800]   I'll stop by your office every Thursday.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.580]   In the meantime, as like questions come up, just throw them in here and that way we won't
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.580]   forget them.
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:04.200]   Whatever it is without making a big deal about it, you've moved this collaboration approach
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.800]   away from unscheduled messages towards something else.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:12.620]   And then just repeat for all of the different collaborations that are going on.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.180]   Think how do I reduce unscheduled messages?
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:18.080]   Now here's an advanced tip here.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.500]   Sometimes the answer is not in what the other person does.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.700]   We love the idea of everyone else is wrong.
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:26.100]   And so like, Hey, don't, instead of emailing me, like come to my office hours, all that
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.660]   type of stuff.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.120]   Sometimes it comes down to what you're doing.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:33.500]   And now this, now we're talking about things that are really in your control buried in
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:39.740]   my book, deep work is a really powerful idea called process oriented emailing.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:44.360]   And it says, think about an email before you press send, right?
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:49.660]   Our instinct is usually what's the quickest path between right now and having the thing
[00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.540]   I'm emailing about off of my plate.
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.420]   So I don't have to stress about it.
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:56.700]   And so we're just hammering on that keyboard project.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.700]   No good.
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.020]   Me want you do fire bad scent, right?
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.260]   I mean, it's like, let's just get this thing out of here.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:06.860]   But the right way to think about that is not how quickly can I get this off my plate, but
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.560]   how many unscheduled messages and replies is going to create.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:14.460]   And actually, I would rather spend more time right now crafting this message if it reduced
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:17.760]   multiple replies in the future.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.420]   So process centric email is where you say, instead of just me, good project, do fire
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:25.820]   badge, you say, all right, so we have this project we need to work on.
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.660]   It's like, what needs to happen here?
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:28.660]   Well, here's what I'm thinking.
[00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:32.660]   And you kind of spell out like how, not just what's going to happen, but how you guys are
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.660]   going to collaborate about it.
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:41.700]   Why don't you take a first look at this, put any thoughts you have into the Google Drive
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.140]   folder we already have for this project.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:50.460]   I have just put on my calendar a block of time Thursday afternoon to take a look at
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:51.540]   that.
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.140]   So just whenever you get to it, get to it.
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:54.260]   I'll take a look at it.
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:58.940]   Then we already have this meeting scheduled for Friday.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:02.140]   Let's just make sure we take the last 15 minutes then to coordinate on this.
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.940]   I'll have already seen your thoughts.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:04.940]   You'll have written them down.
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:05.940]   I'll have looked at them.
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.740]   The final 15 minutes of that meeting, we can then coordinate on where we're a little unclear
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.340]   how we want to go forward.
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.580]   That's a long email.
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:13.580]   Yes.
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:20.180]   That takes longer than just hitting your keyboards as fast as you can and slamming sends with
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.780]   your mutton leg like a caveman.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:27.540]   Yes, it takes longer, but you have just saved any unscheduled messages in this particular
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.940]   collaboration that you have to sit there and wait for and reply to.
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:34.980]   You spell out in the message, "Here is how we're going to collaborate on this."
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:39.220]   The way you spell out does not involve a lot of unscheduled messages that have to be replied
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:40.220]   to.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.540]   There's a lot of different things you can do here, but it's collaboration by collaboration
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:49.460]   steering the implicit strategy for each collaboration towards things that aren't the fastest or
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:53.580]   the most convenient, but that reduce unscheduled messages that you have to reply to.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:58.020]   I really wish we could just have a big flashing number above everyone's computer in these
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.020]   type of jobs.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:02.980]   Like this is your average unscheduled messages you're replying to per day, and as that number
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.500]   goes down, people come in and congratulate you.
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.500]   "Hey, way to go.
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.660]   You got that down to half."
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.660]   That would make a huge difference.
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.660]   So we look at the wrong metrics.
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.700]   We want to blame people.
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.460]   We want to say norms are bad.
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:14.740]   We want to just try to reduce email.
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:20.460]   I mean, nothing, not that it frustrates me, but it kind of frustrates me when people find
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:25.300]   out like, "Oh, you've written a book about email and like reducing the impact of email."
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.740]   Like, "Yeah, I'm with you, man.
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:29.500]   I get so many of these newsletters in my inbox."
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:32.060]   Who cares?
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.840]   You don't have to respond to those, right?
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:38.140]   Does it matter that you have 20 newsletters?
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.980]   Just worst case scenario, you don't read them.
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:42.460]   That's not the problem.
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:43.800]   The problem is not the newsletter.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:49.980]   It's like message seven of 17 from Steve that you're going to have to answer today because
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.700]   you guys are trying to figure out who's going to buy the cake for the birthday party tomorrow.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.900]   And so now you're in your inbox all day waiting for the next message and bouncing it back
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:57.900]   and forth.
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.660]   It's not your newsletters.
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.860]   Unscheduled messages that require a reply, right?
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.100]   So if you know what you're fixing, you can fix it more.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:07.100]   All right.
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:08.220]   Who do we got next?
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:11.620]   The whole time you were doing your example of typing on the keyboard, I was thinking
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:13.340]   of your keyboard that you bought.
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:14.340]   Oh, yes.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.340]   My clicking.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.340]   How's that doing?
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.340]   I love it.
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:18.340]   Okay.
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:19.340]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:20.340]   I love it.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.340]   By the way, when I said we did crazy or deep on my keyboard.
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:24.660]   So for people who don't know, Jess and I do this segment called crazy or deep where I
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:27.700]   like, Hey, is this crazy that I like spent so much money on this?
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.140]   And he tells me if it's crazy or deep.
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:33.660]   So I bought this hundred fifty dollar, $5 keyboard or whatever.
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:40.140]   I heard from people that said, oh, you don't know how deep the mechanical keyboard rabbit
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.140]   hole goes.
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.020]   Like that is nothing.
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:45.560]   You can spend real money in that world.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.180]   So I feel better.
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:48.500]   All right.
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.420]   Next question is from a guy who hates Scrum.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:55.500]   How do I handle a hyperactive hive mind workplace situation when I'm quitting?
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:59.900]   When quitting my current job isn't an option for now, I'm a web developer at a company
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:04.500]   where I must stay connected to a group video meeting during business hours and reply to
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:09.900]   all email and slack messages within 10 minutes, no matter what, or I'll get yelled at for
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.540]   slacking off.
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:16.980]   People don't realize this, but I make Jesse seven days a week, always be logged into a
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:21.860]   zoom room just in case I have something I want to ask them about.
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.120]   That's terrible.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.620]   That's a terrible work environment.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.620]   Right.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:29.700]   So, yeah, short term, buy him a copy of my book.
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.420]   So they can just see how terrible of a work environment that is.
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:39.260]   I mean, this sounds like if I, instead of Milton, wrote Dante's Inferno, this would
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.280]   be one of the circles of hell, I would add.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.260]   You have to be in a video meeting all day long just to make sure that people can just
[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:48.740]   see you at all moments, interrupt you as soon as they need it.
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:52.580]   Here's my bigger point I want to make, and this is not what this guy wants to hear, but
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:55.980]   I think it's important for other people to hear.
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.780]   How your work environment deals with collaboration is a really big deal.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:04.220]   It really matters, and it's something you have to take as seriously as like the location
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:07.980]   of where the work is, like where you would have to live or what the commute is like,
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:11.860]   what the people are like, do you like them or really hate them, and your sort of moral
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.300]   assessment of the work itself.
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:15.980]   This is just as important as that.
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:19.140]   And when evaluating a job, it's got to be one of the key things.
[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:21.060]   How do you collaborate?
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.980]   Is it hyperactive hive mind or is it more structured?
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:29.260]   And I would like to see a world in which people take that into account much more often.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.140]   Oh, we're in a video all day.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:33.380]   Yeah, that's not work.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.380]   That's terrible.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.380]   You know, that's you.
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:39.780]   You might as well told me we work next to the pork rendering plant and you know, it's
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:41.500]   it smells like awful all day, right?
[00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.460]   Like that's a bad thing.
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:47.780]   I think the more people take that into account and ask about it and even make career decisions
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:52.140]   around that, we get an interesting market signal that'll push more of these companies
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:56.700]   towards more sensical and psychologically sustainable ways of working.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:01.220]   So I want to be so quick to say quitting my current job isn't an option.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.780]   It might not be for now, but you need to think about this like you just discovered that,
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:05.780]   hey, wait a second.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:10.700]   I'm at Enron, you know, in like 2000, I don't like what's going on here.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:13.380]   I think I might want to get out of this ship.
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:17.420]   Do not, we should not take lightly collaboration style.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.620]   That should be one of our tier one concerns we have when evaluating companies and we should
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:21.620]   be vocal about it.
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:24.780]   And if you do end up leaving this place, make it clear to them.
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:30.580]   That's a big reason why they'll bluster and you know, but the signal there is important.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:34.660]   Like this is no way to take human brains and have them work together to produce value is
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.260]   a terrible way to run something.
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:39.460]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:44.340]   Next question from Jack, how can I work deeply at writing code when this often necessitates
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:49.940]   having ready access to a web browser for stack overflow reference or other users without
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.140]   getting distracted?
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:55.460]   I have the unhooked YouTube extension and that does a lot of good, but I still find
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:56.820]   myself checking email.
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:02.660]   All right, well, I have three suggestions that are going to go in order of you disliking
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.460]   most to disliking least.
[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:09.540]   All right, so my first suggestion, which you'll dislike most is to grow up, right?
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:10.660]   It's your job.
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:13.460]   Don't look at other stuff on your web browser when you're coding.
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.460]   Don't check email.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.180]   Don't go on YouTube.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:18.700]   You know, just you have to grow up a little bit.
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:19.740]   This is my job.
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:22.340]   When I code, I code, I don't do these other things.
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:27.620]   If I need to go to stack overflow to look up an algorithm analysis or a library, whatever,
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:31.960]   I will just go there and just make the rule really clear and don't break the road.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:36.860]   Don't break that rule because you're growing up in a job that they're paying you to do.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.900]   Don't fall completely into this victim mindset of like, what can I do?
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.100]   The internet is so compelling and I can't control myself.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:49.460]   Look, I'm on board with that argument for a lot of ways the internet is in our life.
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:52.780]   But when you're at your job and working and working on something very specific like coding,
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:57:00.220]   just have a rule and follow the rule because that's, you know, work in general is corralling
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.940]   your attention on one thing despite other things your mind would rather do.
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:03.940]   All right.
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:05.560]   So that's the answer you're not going to like.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.900]   The answer you'll maybe kind of like.
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.820]   Time blocking helps what I just said.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:13.340]   So you time block, here's what I'm doing for this 90 minutes.
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.020]   Here's what I'm doing for this 30 minutes.
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:20.140]   It's much easier to follow that advice to grow up and do your work when you're working
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:24.440]   and don't get distracted by other things because now you can say, I'm in a programming block.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.380]   It's on my time block planner.
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:29.700]   It's 90 minutes long and then I have an email check block.
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:31.420]   I'm still in the middle of that programming block.
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:32.940]   I don't check email during the programming block.
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:33.940]   I check it.
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:35.980]   It's coming up.
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:38.860]   That's actually a lot easier than when you don't time block because when you don't time
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:39.860]   block, here's what your mind says.
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:43.740]   We're going to have to check email at some point.
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:44.740]   Why not now?
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:45.740]   And you're like, well, I'm coding.
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:47.140]   And then it's like, well, why not now?
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:48.140]   Why not now?
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:49.140]   Why not now?
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.140]   Why not now?
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:51.460]   Like you're constantly having to have this debate with your mind about like, hey, we're
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:52.680]   going to have to take a break at some point.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.140]   Why not look at YouTube now?
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:58.340]   So time blocking is going to make that first thing much easier because you're saying, yeah,
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:57:59.540]   this is when we're taking a break.
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:00.580]   This is when we're checking email.
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:01.580]   This is a good plan.
[00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:02.580]   I'm a grownup.
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:03.580]   I can follow a plan.
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:04.580]   Come on.
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:05.580]   All right.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:09.740]   The one you'll probably like best as a coder is a high-tech solution.
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:14.620]   Consider using GitHub's AI-powered copilot feature.
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:20.420]   So the GitHub copilot is based off of, I think, GPT-4.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:22.580]   It's integrated straight into your IDE.
[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:26.360]   So the integrated development environment in which you code, it replaces a lot of stack
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.140]   overflow googling.
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:31.180]   This is in the weeds, so like other people can kind of glaze over here.
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:36.620]   But it's basically a tool where if you're a programmer, it uses a generative AI model
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:40.140]   to help you do things like, what's the name of this library?
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.460]   I don't know how this call goes.
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:44.620]   It figures out what you're, oh, I know what you're looking for.
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.620]   Here's it.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:46.620]   Here's how this goes.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:51.800]   Or you can say, could you write out some quick sample code that uses these functions?
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:55.040]   And it gives you the code, and then you can modify it.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.540]   If you're not a programmer, what you need to know is like, these are things right now
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:59.900]   that people solve by googling.
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:03.220]   There's a couple of websites, like he mentioned, Stack Overflow, which is like a Reddit-style
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.880]   bulletin board.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:10.300]   And right now, a lot of programmers, what you do is you google Stack Overflow for examples,
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:13.260]   and it's humans have posted examples.
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:21.460]   This integration of AI into the IDE can handle about 50% of that Google searching, but you
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:22.460]   don't actually have to google.
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:23.500]   All right, so that, there you go.
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:28.220]   So I gave you an array of answers here from, will make you mad, to like, okay, to like,
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:29.220]   yes.
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:32.420]   Because tech people, Jesse, love the like, here's a tool.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:37.340]   Here's the secret is like, you got to harness a large language model with a trillion parameters.
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:39.820]   That's more sexy than, come on, man, grow up.
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:45.380]   All right, let's do one more question and then a call, and then we'll jump on to the
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:46.380]   third.
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:47.380]   >> Okay.
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:48.380]   Next question is from Michael.
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:54.540]   Cal, I recently began doing morning work sessions without my phone to produce my productivity.
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:57.100]   I own my own business and have employees and clients.
[00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:01.420]   A couple hours into my work, however, I begin getting stressed that I could be missing important
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.420]   emails.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:03.420]   How can I solve this?
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:04.420]   >> Right.
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:09.300]   So, you know, Michael, in his elaboration, was talking about he spends a couple hours
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:15.260]   every morning just locked in before he checks his email and he's stressed.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.980]   Try it.
[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.260]   Try it for two weeks.
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:22.640]   And your goal here is not, does anyone ever get mad at me?
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:28.280]   Your goal is, is the amount that the magnitude of the issues tolerable?
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.820]   And I think you'll find it is.
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:33.820]   That, yes, there are a lot of emails waiting in the morning, but often the emails waiting
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:38.300]   in the morning are people who are clearing out their email inboxes the night before or
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.900]   who are waking up early to try to get ahead of their email before meetings start.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.840]   They don't even want you to respond right away.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.220]   They just went through a huge push to clear out their inbox.
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:50.820]   They want a little bit of peace before these replies start coming back in.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:55.540]   So I think you'll find if you just test it, okay, I wait till 10 a.m. before I see my
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.740]   email inbox, that your clients and stuff are fine.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.140]   They're getting emails at 10 versus nine.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.140]   It's going to be fine.
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:04.340]   And if it's a problem, then you can come up with an alternative for those clients that
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.980]   if they definitely need to hear from you in that hour.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:13.020]   There's a story about this in a world without email of a company that was just dying in
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:14.020]   email.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.020]   They were just drowning in email.
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:18.580]   It was a UX design company, internally and externally.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:25.180]   And so they switched over to this completely email-free, when I say essentially email-free,
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:30.460]   they still used email to deliver files and invoices and stuff, but they essentially moved
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.140]   away from digital communication as a way of structuring their work.
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:36.860]   Instead, they had these two check-ins at the beginning of the morning, at the beginning
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.340]   of the afternoon, and, "Hey, what are you working on?
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.340]   What are the obstacles?
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.340]   What do you need?"
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:42.340]   And it was great, right?
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.140]   They got away from just being on Slack and email all day.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.500]   They did the same with their clients.
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:54.380]   And the way they decided to do this was when you sign a contract with us as a client, there
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:58.820]   is going to be an addendum to that contract called our communication policy.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:02.100]   And you are going to sign off on this is how we are going to communicate, how you're going
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.780]   to ask questions, when we're going to talk to you.
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.020]   And they had a really good system.
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:08.860]   It was like weekly conference calls, where at the end of the conference call, a written
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:12.660]   record of every question or obligation or commitment made during the call was then sent
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.100]   to the client, so they have a written record and whatever.
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.420]   They had a whole system.
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:18.020]   Two partners in this company.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.740]   One of the partners was the client-facing guy.
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:20.980]   One of the partners was the tech guy.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:23.460]   The client-facing guy was terrified, right?
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.860]   He said, "Michael, this is much worse than what you're doing."
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:30.460]   This was like, "You're going to have to sign a contract that says you can't email us."
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:34.460]   He was like, "We are going to lose all of our clients."
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.460]   And guess what?
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:36.460]   No one cared.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:42.060]   Because it turns out, it's not the accessibility that people really care about that you answer
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.060]   me all the time.
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.620]   It is clarity.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:49.960]   If I have an issue that you are required to resolve, I want it to be crystal clear to
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.140]   me how that gets resolved.
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:57.860]   I do not want to keep track of this in my head, because that's a source of stress.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:01.860]   If you have no alternative way or clarity system to do this, then yes, they're going
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:05.620]   to want you to answer right away, because they can't take this out of their head until
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.300]   you answer it.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:10.660]   But if there is alternative ways to do this that also lets them take it out of their head,
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:11.660]   they're just as happy.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:14.860]   And that's what this company did in a world without email.
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:18.260]   You could just write down, you knew this call was coming up, and the clients had their list
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:21.080]   of things to talk about, and they got the written record, so they knew nothing was going
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.220]   to be dropped, and it was fine, and they didn't have to worry about these things in between
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.220]   the calls.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:29.500]   Michael, if there's a couple of clients that are upset that you don't do email in the morning,
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.420]   there'll be a very similar system.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:36.740]   In fact, you can even have an office hour, 30 minutes at 10 a.m., you know, this is my
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:40.460]   beginning of the day, open doors, right, or here's a shared document, just throw all of
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:45.020]   your issues into here, or you know you're going to hear from me between 10 and 11.
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:48.520]   Just that clarity is what's going to matter, not the accessibility.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.520]   All right.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.520]   Do we have a call?
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.520]   >> Yes, we do.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.520]   >> All right.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.140]   Let's get a call in here.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.940]   >> Hey, Kyle.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:56.940]   My name is Jose.
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:01.220]   I'm a doctoral student with ambitions to land a tenure-track faculty position in the next
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.700]   four years.
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:07.180]   If I remember correctly, in a recent episode, you mentioned that in your 30s, you were quite
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:12.180]   busy with your professional life, and that you've now shifted to a more human lifestyle.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:16.940]   With this in mind, my question is, would you still recommend slow productivity practices
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:22.140]   to someone in the beginning of their career, particularly to those with academic ambitions?
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:27.660]   It seems to me that there's a tension between the publish or perish culture and slow productivity.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:32.060]   I would also very much appreciate any wisdom or tips you can share on landing an academic
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.060]   position.
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:34.060]   Thanks.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:35.060]   >> Well, it's a good question.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:43.660]   The intersection of slow productivity and academia, which I got to say, I won't name names, but
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:49.820]   I've been doing a lot of podcasts, and there's been two podcasters who I did their show who
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:54.020]   unsolicited said like, "Hey, this is my favorite thing of yours you've ever ... Slow productivity
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:57.420]   is my favorite thing of yours you've ever written.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:00.300]   It's like either this or deep work, and it might be this."
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.140]   Both of those people are academics.
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:06.380]   So I think there's something in this book that clearly, because I'm an academic, I'm
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:11.940]   sort of implicitly, even without realizing it, preaching to the choir a little bit.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.100]   Is slow productivity incompatible with publish or perish?
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.100]   I don't think so.
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:17.660]   I don't think so.
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:21.460]   There's a lot of academics that are profiled in this book.
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:28.320]   Publish or perish, we think of it colloquially as a fast activity, but my God, it is so much
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:34.020]   slower than the type of fast productivity that I'm really pushing back on.
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:40.040]   Publish or perish is I'm writing three papers this year, right?
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:48.400]   So actually, slow productivity is really well fitted for an academic lifestyle because what
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.740]   it tells you is, okay, what matters is your papers, and just focus on beautiful papers,
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:54.800]   really smart papers.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.460]   Give that time.
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:58.100]   Give it a lot of your time.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.100]   Keep coming back to it.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.100]   Take your time.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.100]   Produce great stuff.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.420]   That's how you get tenure, right?
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.020]   It's all based on letters.
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:05.460]   How good is this person's scholarship?
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.100]   How influential is it in the world?
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.320]   There is no games.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.820]   There is no politics.
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:14.300]   People who don't understand academia think it's all just these weird, subtle things,
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.260]   and no, it's confidential letters.
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.160]   How influential and smart is this person's work?
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.160]   That's it.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:23.640]   That's a slow productivity game, but slow productivity also tells you, make sure you
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.320]   don't have a lot of other stuff on your plate at the same time.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.680]   Now, most research institutions try to help with this pre-tenure.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:35.240]   They want to keep your obligations low, your teaching load easy, your administrative obligations
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.240]   light.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.520]   Now, I understand before I get the letters, this is, I'm talking here like tier one, Carnegie
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.520]   one, R1 research institutions.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:47.160]   I know most professors, because there's a lot of colleges, most professors don't care
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:50.060]   that much about, they don't give, they're not giving that latitude, right?
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.520]   If you're not at a tier one research institution, I get it.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.400]   They're like, "We care about research.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.400]   Here's your six courses.
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.400]   Teach."
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.120]   And I also recognize it's very different for adjunct or non-tenure line faculty.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.720]   But the person asking a question here is interested.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:06.400]   It sounds like it's a tier one research academia.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.460]   That's a slow productivity game.
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:14.760]   Coming back to again and again, great research, making progress, publishing things, not getting
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:18.520]   caught up in the small, not getting caught up in the busy, not having too many things
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.860]   going on at the same time.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:24.520]   Just this like relentless return to thinking.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:28.600]   So why was my thirties difficult?
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.600]   And again, it's all relative, right?
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:34.680]   I mean, I still largely worked nine to five and et cetera, because I was doing multiple
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.680]   jobs.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.680]   All right.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:42.160]   So maybe don't write books, you know, unrelated to your academic career at the same time you're
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.480]   trying to get tenure.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.480]   Don't do that.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.480]   And I think you'll be okay.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:49.800]   See, I was running two jobs as an author and an academic and had all of our kids were had
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.160]   during that, my thirties as well.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.880]   So there's a lot going on.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.640]   So just pick two out of those three and you'll be okay.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.920]   Embrace slow productivity, pick two out of those three things, and I think you'll be
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:01.920]   okay.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.560]   All right.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:08.200]   So we're coming up to our third and final segment.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.360]   This is where we are going to, I'm going to talk about my New York Times op-ed, I'm going
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.880]   to read comments, which again is either a great or terrible idea, but first let's take
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.760]   another quick break to talk about some sponsors.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:24.160]   Start with our longtime friends at Blinkist, an app that gives you 6,500 book summaries
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:29.720]   and expert led audio guides to read and listen to in just 15 minutes per title.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:34.720]   You can access best in class, actionable knowledge from 27 categories, such as productivity,
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:40.040]   you would read about that, psychology and more on the go and get entertained at the
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.880]   same time.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:46.520]   We're really having a good, by the way, presence right now on the time management category
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.480]   on Amazon.
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.640]   We got deep work is representing, slow productivity is representing, we're having a good day up
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.640]   there.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.640]   All right.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.640]   So how do you, why should you use Blinkist?
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:00.100]   Well, the way Jesse and I use Blinkist is actually to triage books.
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:04.920]   We hear about a book we're interested in, we put it on our queue, a list somewhere,
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.960]   and what we do is we first listen to the blink.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:10.920]   That's the name for the 15 minute summary.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.920]   Jesse likes to read them.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:12.920]   I like to listen to them.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.520]   You can do both with the Blinkist app.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:19.720]   Getting the 15 minute summary of a book gives you a really accurate sense of, do I really
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.200]   want to buy this book and read the whole thing, or do I get the gist and that's enough?
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:27.600]   It's a fantastic way to help run triage on the reading life.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.520]   People use it for a lot of different reasons, but that's the way I like to use it.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:36.020]   We also want to mention they have a special promotion right now called Blinkist Connect.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:39.000]   With Blinkist, you can give another person unlimited access for free.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.880]   It's basically two for one.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.880]   All right.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   So that's cool.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.520]   So you can now share your Blinkist account and let other people get into it.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.520]   All right.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.000]   So right now Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.920]   Go to Blinkist.com/deep to start your seven day free trial and get 25% off a Blinkist
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.800]   premium membership.

[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.520]   day free trial, Blinkist.com/deep.

[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.740]   account.

[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.320]   All right.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.520]   We also got to talk about life insurance.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.240]   We talk about this a lot on the show because we talk about procrastination a lot on this
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.240]   show.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:30.680]   There are certain things you know you need to do, like get more life insurance to help
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.280]   take care of those who depend on you, but we don't do it.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.740]   And why don't we do it?
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:41.400]   Not because we're bad, not because we're lazy, but because our mind doesn't trust that we
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.640]   have a good plan on how to take action.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.240]   That is why we procrastinate.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.080]   So stop procrastinating on getting life insurance.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:53.840]   What you need is an easy way that you completely understand that you know you can get that
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.160]   insurance without there being any ambiguity or difficulty.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:02.160]   And I'm talking about our friends at Policy Genius.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.580]   Policy Genius technology makes it easy to compare life insurance quotes from America's
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.240]   top insurers.

[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.960]   Even if you already have a life insurance through work, it may not be enough and it
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:15.960]   may not follow you.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.420]   If you leave your job, you need your own protection.
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:24.720]   With Policy Genius, you can find life insurance policies that start at just $292 per year
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.720]   for $1 million of coverage.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:33.380]   Some options even offer same-day approval and will help you avoid unnecessary medical
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:35.380]   exams.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:38.020]   So we have just simplified this task.
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:39.600]   Any more life insurance?

[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:47.180]   Now your brain trusts, I know exactly what to do and exactly what to expect, and that
[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:49.640]   urge to procrastinate will go away.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:54.800]   So save time and money and provide your family with a financial safety net using Policy Genius.

[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.840]   That's policygenius.com/deepquestions.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:10.760]   As long as we're talking about health, let's also talk about our good friends at ZocDoc.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:17.600]   All right, ZocDoc is the place where you can find a book doctors who will make you feel
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:21.120]   comfortable and actually listen to you.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.880]   We're not just talking about a few, we're talking about tens of thousands of doctors
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:29.760]   all with verified patient reviews so you can make sure the vibes are vibing before you
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.260]   ever meet an IRL.
[01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:37.320]   All those are terms I use often as Jesse knows, vibe and IRL.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.640]   With ZocDoc, you've got more options than you know.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:47.200]   ZocDoc is one of these things that I think just makes a lot of sense, right?
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:51.160]   All those sorts of things in our life, movies we want to see, clothing we want to buy, a
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.000]   car we want to buy, we go online.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.520]   Hey, what do people recommend?
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.080]   Where is the car I want to buy?
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.080]   Is there one available?
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.080]   What's the price going to be?
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.920]   ZocDoc does the same sort of thing for medical care.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.640]   It is a free app and website that helps you search and compare highly rated in-network
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.520]   doctors near you and instantly book appointments with them online.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.520]   I need a doctor.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.520]   Here's one nearby.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.520]   Do they take my insurance?
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.520]   Yes, they do.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.520]   I need a doctor.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:18.520]   Let's just do this right here.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.520]   Done.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:23.000]   10 minutes, you have that podiatrist appointment that before you were thinking, how am I ever
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   going to do this?
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.320]   I don't even know where to start finding a doctor.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.320]   Do I call them?
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.320]   Do I ask a friend?
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:33.320]   ZocDoc takes this thing we do all the time, getting healthcare appointments, and it makes
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:36.480]   it so much easier.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.400]   The reviews is the icing on the cake here.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:43.840]   Real patient verified reviews, you can find out before you make that appointment, does
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.920]   this doctor use terms like vibes and IRL all the time, because then maybe I want to go
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.920]   to another one.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:52.040]   So you could even find out, do people like this doctor?
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:56.680]   Man, this is such a crapshoot otherwise, ZocDoc makes this all easier.
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:02.480]   Ooh, they even have now, here's a cool stat, the typical wait time to see a doctor booked
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.440]   on ZocDoc is between 24 and 72 hours.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.440]   That's it.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.600]   So not only can you find a doctor that takes your insurance that people like, you can probably
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.760]   find one who can see you soon.
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.660]   So not only is ZocDoc a good idea.
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:15.600]   It's actually a service I use as well.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:21.880]   I now have two different medical care providers who use ZocDoc.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:26.520]   They use it not just for setting up appointments, but they use it for getting the paperwork
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.600]   done ahead of appointment.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.600]   So it's made my life a lot easier.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:34.640]   If I was to be looking for a new doctor anytime in the near future for any type of specialty
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:39.040]   issue, I would know exactly where to go to ZocDoc.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:44.700]   So go to ZocDoc.com/deep and download the ZocDoc app for free.
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:47.580]   Then find a book, a top rated doctor today.
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:52.900]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep, ZocDoc.com/deep.
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:59.260]   All right, Jesse, time for our final segment.
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:04.100]   I want to talk about this op-ed I wrote for the New York Times as part of the publicity
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.740]   for my new book, Slow Productivity.
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:09.740]   I'll bring it up here on the screen for people who are watching.
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:16.620]   The op-ed was called To Cure Burnout, Embrace Seasonality.
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:22.140]   So seasonality was one of the big ideas that was in my book, Slow Productivity, in particular
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:24.660]   in the chapter on working at a natural pace.
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:26.100]   I won't go through the whole article.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:31.540]   I'll just give you the short summary so you can understand what's going to come next in
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:32.780]   this segment.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:38.740]   The short summary here is that working at full intensity all day long, every day, all
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:44.220]   year round is something that is not natural.
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:49.500]   So I argue that when knowledge work arose as a major economic sector, we took on this
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:54.060]   idea because we saw factories doing it, and that's what was big in the economy at the
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:55.060]   time.
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:58.220]   But it doesn't necessarily make sense as a way to do cognitive work.
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:02.140]   So let me read a little bit from my own article here.
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:06.500]   Those buildings became virtual factories, with members of this growing class of workers
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:11.340]   metaphorically clocking in for 8-hour shifts week after week, month after month, attempting
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:16.100]   to transform their mental capacities into valuable output with the same regularity as
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.500]   an assembly line worker churning out automobiles.
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:23.260]   In recent years, I've come to believe that the decision to treat the pacing of cognitive
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:27.220]   jobs like manufacturing jobs was a mistake.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:31.580]   We seem to have forgotten that life in the mills and factories was miserable.
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:36.420]   The unrelenting pace of those jobs eventually required the formation of labor unions and
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:41.760]   regulatory innovations, like the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which introduced a
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:47.000]   mandated work week and overtime pay, all of which emphasized the artificiality of forcing
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.420]   our efforts into such an unvarying and demanding rhythm.
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:54.920]   And yet, as more of us shifted into the comparable comfort of office buildings, we carried over
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:59.260]   the same flawed model forged onto factory floor.
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:03.300]   I go on to argue that when it comes to doing cognitive work, much more variation intensity
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:05.300]   is better.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:10.720]   Having a refractory period after intense thinking helps you reset and reflect.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.020]   Over time, you produce more results.
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:18.940]   I give a lot of examples from my book of people like Georgia O'Keefe or Lin-Manuel Miranda,
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:24.300]   Marie Curie, all of whom had much more wildly varying intensities and that led to better
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.440]   work than just trying to do work hard all day long.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:30.560]   And then I gave a bunch of advice about, okay, how might you actually implement something
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:35.000]   like seasonality in your company, or if you work for someone else who doesn't want you
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.260]   to do it, what are ideas for making this practical?
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.260]   That's the article, right?
[01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:42.020]   It's a kind of classic adapted essay from a book op-ed.
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:48.020]   So I thought it would be either a good idea or a terrible idea, Jesse, to read some of
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:53.860]   the comments from New York Times readers to this audience, I mean, to this piece.
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:59.480]   Why I think this is useful to do is it gives us a sense about at least how a certain segment
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.160]   of society is grappling with these issues.
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.900]   So how does a typical New York Times reader grapple with these type of issues?
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.860]   What I'm going to do here is I'm going to start with a critical comment, because I would
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:14.900]   say it's the most common critical comment I am hearing from this sector.
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:19.040]   And then before I respond to it, I'm going to read the reply of another New York Times
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:24.040]   reader to this comment, because I think the reply gets this exactly right.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:28.120]   Then I'm going to read a positive comment, and then another one that just introduces
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.560]   an interesting extra idea I didn't even think about.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.000]   All right.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.940]   The negative comment, this came from a user, a New York Times reader named WTS.
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:42.720]   I'll do this in my best sarcastic voice, okay, because I think this is supposed to be sarcastic.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:43.720]   Great idea.
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:48.360]   Cure burnout by spending summers at your country farm, like Georgia O'Keeffe.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.440]   I'm going to share this suggestion with my friends who are baristas, farm techs, and
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.840]   nurse assistants.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.160]   All right.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:01.360]   That's an accurate rendering of the voice of WTS.
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:07.080]   I get this similar comments I've heard multiple times in my publicity tour so far.
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:10.880]   I call it the what about comment.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.880]   What about so-and-so?
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.880]   What about so-and-so?
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.880]   All right.
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:14.880]   I'm not going to respond to this directly.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:23.080]   I want to read the response of a user named Jay, a New York Times reader named Jay @WTS.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.920]   This is not a barista or nurse assistant issue.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.000]   You'll find that in other articles.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.480]   The article is about knowledge workers who cannot produce creative focus thought on demand
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:36.040]   on a uniform schedule day in and day out like a cog in a factory machine because creative
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:37.920]   focus thought doesn't work that way.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:41.800]   All right, Jay, I think you got that exactly right.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:46.720]   The whole premise of the book is this particular sector had a very specific dynamic.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.320]   It was very autonomous.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.960]   This type of creative knowledge work had very autonomous organizational dictates.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:57.120]   You figure out how you want to organize your own work, but it was also coupled with this
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:01.720]   implicit heuristic called pseudo productivity, which meant visible activity will be our proxy
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.720]   for useful effort.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:07.200]   Then these two things very specifically combined with the digital front office revolution,
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:12.440]   which is specific to this sector with email and portable computing laptops, etc.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:16.880]   All these things mixed together to create a very specific but very intense problem that
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:23.520]   affects probably 20 or 30% of the U.S. economy, and this book is about how to fix it.
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:27.520]   So yes, it's not a book about other sectors of the economy, but I do get asked this a
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.960]   lot of times.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:34.880]   I always think about this as you write the book about running, like how do you train
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:41.000]   for running, etc., and then you get the response, "Yeah, but how is this going to help someone
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.600]   with no legs or something, right?"
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:45.960]   Like, "Well, they probably aren't interested in that book because it's about runners."
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.720]   Or, "What about people who hate running?
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.440]   How is your book about running going to help them?"
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.280]   It's like, "Well, the book is not written for people who hate running."
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.280]   So, all right.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.280]   There you go, Jay.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.280]   So there's my answer.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.840]   This book is about knowledge workers.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.920]   It's a large but certainly not entire economy.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:01.920]   All right.
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.920]   Let's go to a positive comment here.
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.400]   This one came from Robin.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:11.440]   "I have been saying this for years, that I would thrive at my job, which is leadership
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.800]   at a tech company, if it operated more like college semesters.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:18.800]   I often think sometimes I just need a week to stare at the ceiling after an intense period
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.800]   of work.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.600]   Instead, we use our limited time off to travel, which is its own kind of stress."
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:28.120]   And there's a couple of good responses to this as well.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:32.640]   One reader wrote in in response to Robin and said, "In my experience, tech work used to
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.560]   follow such an ebb and flow.
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:39.640]   In the 1980s and 90s, release OS releases were every 18 or 24 months.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:43.160]   Work was intense just before release, and then slacked off after release.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:46.080]   Then the pace picked up considerably."
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:51.880]   Someone else said, responding particularly to Robin's comment about traveling for vacation,
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:56.700]   "It just fills your only time off with more stress," and said, "This is why I've learned
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:01.240]   to love staycations, and not just because there's a great deal of satisfaction in finally
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.720]   having a stretch of time I can dedicate to all those things that pile up in the house
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.960]   and need to be done without feeling like I'm wasting my weekend.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.520]   It's more zen where you can just stretch out."
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.940]   All right, that's interesting, right?
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:18.520]   This is a cool comment because there's a couple extra bits of information there that's new.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:22.520]   So here's someone saying, "Hey, in the 80s and 90s, the tech industry used to be more
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:23.520]   cyclical.
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:28.760]   You'd have intense periods and non-intense periods, and now it all seems to be intense.
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.240]   What's the difference between the 80s and 90s?"
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:35.960]   Well, it rhymes with shmeemail, I hope that helps you.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.560]   It's a big argument in my book.
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:42.160]   Is portable computing and digital networks and digital communication tools got rid of
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:46.640]   any sort of natural cyclicality and created this like there's always work to be done,
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.680]   there's always back pressure, so you always need to be pulling things in, and you're always
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:50.680]   being watched.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:51.680]   It's really an issue.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.960]   And I do like that point.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:56.960]   If we only get two weeks off a year, and we do stressful travel during those two weeks,
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.720]   we really get no time off each year.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.840]   So that's a good comment.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:01.840]   Here's another negative comment.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.260]   I like to go back and forth.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:08.660]   Here's the other type of comment I get, which is just less interesting.
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:13.620]   So there's a whole revival right now of sort of like traditional left-wing anti-capitalist
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.800]   labor politics.
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:16.800]   And again, we've talked about it.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:20.760]   It's kind of weird because the traditional left-wing anti-capitalist labor politics are
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:27.480]   actually at odds with identity-based postmodern critical theory left-wing progressive politics.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:31.760]   These are two different visions of left-wing philosophy that don't actually play well together.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:37.500]   So it's sort of interesting that the anti-capitalist crowd is gaining ground again online because
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:42.240]   they're actually in opposition to the more of, and you would use like the label woke
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:44.680]   for this, but more of the identity-based postmodern.
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:51.560]   These are in oppositions, like the hardcore socialist at like the Jacobin magazine don't
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.200]   like the hardcore critical theorist.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:59.120]   And because these are different visions of left-wing worlds, but whatever.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.960]   There's a big anti-capitalist strain.
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:04.080]   So I wanted to give that its representation here in these comments.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.960]   This is from Josh.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.840]   In the modern economy, we don't get to feel like ourselves.
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:11.080]   There's never enough time to just be.
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:15.760]   Two weeks vacation in the U.S. is a miserably 10 days off or 261 days at the job.
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:19.720]   On weekends, it's about how to keep the household running, complete chores, run errands and
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:23.680]   support children or manage other things to fall by the wayside while trying to squeeze
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.680]   in some enjoyment.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.040]   Europeans have 20 or more days off a year.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.040]   That would be a good start.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.980]   Actually, this is not a super anti-capitalist one really.
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:32.240]   This is just a European one.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:38.000]   Some of the comments were much more just like we have to overthrow capitalism, which makes
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.300]   for a good comment, but doesn't really help the person who's overloaded with their inbox
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:45.160]   because they're probably not overthrowing capitalism this week.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.800]   And they have all these projects this week.
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:50.680]   This is more of a European response, which I appreciate, which is just you guys care
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:51.680]   too much about work.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.680]   Take more time off.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:55.520]   This is where quiet quitting got wrong.
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.000]   Quiet quitting went too far.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.520]   And we're like, we'll always do the bare minimum and we're going to declare it and we're going
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:02.520]   to put it up.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:04.240]   The Europeans have this more dialed in.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.920]   Like we're all kind of implicitly on the same page here.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.800]   It's like we're going to work, but we're also going to drink a little wine at lunch, if
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.800]   you know what I mean.
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.920]   It's a little bit more wink wink implicit, more cultural.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:16.920]   One more comment here.
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.400]   This one came from Jimerson.
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.560]   Our minds and bodies run on cycles from circadian to the seasonal.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:27.840]   When I was a Northern adolescent, I habitually retreated to my attic room for long periods
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:30.160]   in the winter, prompting my father to express his disapproval.
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:32.360]   Oh, he's hibernating again.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.440]   I now embrace seasonal hibernation in my adulthood.
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:40.240]   I lived in Los Angeles for nearly a decade and the lack of vivid seasonal variation,
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:44.240]   it could be 86 degrees and sunny on any given day of the year and often was made me feel
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:47.040]   time feel unreal to me, like progress itself had stalled.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.640]   So I thought it was a cool point.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:54.000]   This idea that maybe we're just cyclical beings, just as humans.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.320]   We're used to and want cycles and we should have the same in our work as well.
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:03.760]   When you were talking to Ferris in the interview, you explained to him the quiet quitting concept
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:04.760]   as well.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:05.760]   Do you have a kick out of that?
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:09.840]   Well, Ferris' crowd is probably not a big quiet quitting crowd.
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.920]   Well, you're saying most of them are probably self-employed.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:16.100]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:21.320]   And that is a big difference in reaction to slow productivity.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:27.120]   People who are from that more entrepreneurial, self-employed crowd see these concepts differently
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.880]   because they're in control of what they do.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:34.080]   So it's all about ideas for how they might reshape their work, where people who work
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.360]   in big organizations have a completely different feel.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:41.320]   You feel a lot less control and it's about how can I change this without my boss really
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.320]   getting mad at me.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.480]   There's a lot of interesting dynamics.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.760]   Workplace dynamics are interesting.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:51.560]   I also really liked how you explained to him your two word concepts for a lot of the things
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.560]   that you write about.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.560]   It's my whole career.
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.560]   I love that.
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.880]   Come up with two words that describe something everyone already knows.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:01.360]   Deep work, digital minimalism, slow productivity.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.800]   The whole thing about my books is I know it's successful if people do, and they've done
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:09.720]   this for all these books, confidently been like, "I'm a big fan of this idea," and then
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:13.560]   just give a completely unrelated description.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:17.080]   That means you've built a term that people feel like, "I know exactly what that means."
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.080]   Even if they don't.
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.800]   It's like, "Yeah, man, I am on board with slow productivity.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:27.280]   We need to move at a slower pace in the office because we're wearing out our shoes."
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:30.360]   It'll be completely different, but they're like, "I'm just so on board."
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:34.520]   That's how you know you have a good title, is that people are like, "Yeah, I'm on board
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.520]   with that."
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.520]   All right.
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.840]   Well, anyways, speaking of being on board, that's all the time I have.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.440]   I'm actually, interestingly enough, about to head over to People's Book, the bookstore
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:48.760]   here in Tacoma Park, through which you can order signed pre-orders of my book, Slow Productivity.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:52.920]   I have about 300 books to sign here in my near future, so wish me luck on that.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:58.000]   Otherwise, I'll be back next week from the road, special book launch edition of the Deep
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.800]   Questions Podcast, celebrating the launch of Slow Productivity.
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.280]   I'll join you from the road, probably LA, maybe Austin.
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:08.380]   We'll see where I am when I get around to recording, so I'll see you soon.
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:13.920]   But until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.800]   If you liked today's discussion about the history of email, I think you'll also like
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:23.640]   episode 233, which is titled Escaping Your Tyrannical Inbox.
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:29.080]   It has a lot of concrete advice for taming the role of email in your career.
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:30.080]   I think you'll like it.
