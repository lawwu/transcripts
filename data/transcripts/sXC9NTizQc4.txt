[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.640]   - All right, moving right along here, Jesse,
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.040]   what do we got next?
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.040]   - All right, next up, we have a question from Joe
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.160]   and he's got a, he talks about little bets,
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.240]   a concept that you introduced in your book,
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.880]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.680]   - Hi Cal, this is Joe from the Midwest.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.920]   I wanted to thank you for answering my previous questions,
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.400]   especially the one about getting, recognizing
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.280]   that we're going through a year of a dumpster fire
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.880]   and to spend the summer really chiseling away
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.160]   at the deep work and get a marine stove while I do it.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.360]   Didn't get the marine stove,
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.720]   but I did spend the summer working on the big project
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.720]   and it was, it helps keep me sane.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.160]   My question is about little bets.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.260]   You mentioned in "So Good They Can't Ignore You"
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.560]   that you allot time to pursue little bets
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.920]   and you test them out on your blog,
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.600]   as short little blog posts,
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.120]   or you test them out in different ways.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.480]   I'm wondering, as you get deeper into your career,
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.920]   do you still allot a significant amount of time
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.840]   for these little bets?
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.160]   For me, I'm very fortunate that I got my first book deal.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.380]   I'm working really hard on that project
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.560]   and a couple of other really big rocks for my career,
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.640]   but I don't really see, short of Athena
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.280]   bursting out of my skull,
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.520]   how I can allot specific time just to pursue little bets
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.840]   when these other looming deadlines and big projects
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.200]   need my attention now.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.240]   So if you could spend some time talking about
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880]   what role does little bets take
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.960]   as you get deeper into your career,
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.360]   I think it would really help.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.000]   Thanks.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.260]   - Well, Joe, congratulations on the book deal.
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.840]   Shame, however, for not buying a marine pellet stove
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.040]   'cause that is critical.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.120]   That is critical to any deep work shed space.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.200]   For people who don't remember this question,
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.280]   it was Michael Pollan.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.080]   When Michael Pollan built a writer's shed
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.160]   in the woods behind his house in Kent, Connecticut,
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.360]   he heated it with a marine pellet stove.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.720]   So it's like a pellet burning stove you put on a boat.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.320]   So it generates heat, but it's like small,
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.360]   because it's main just for heating a boat.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.700]   And so you put a pellet, marine pellet stove
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.280]   in your teeny house, and that's how you heat it
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.340]   while you look out over the snow strewn fields
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.800]   and the snow laden boughs of the birch trees
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.840]   in Kent, Connecticut, and have that warmth
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.920]   as you write in your cabin, wood line cabin.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.640]   That's the vision.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.240]   So yeah, you still need to buy that stove.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.600]   I actually went out to Kent, Connecticut a few years ago
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.200]   and was doing a speaking gig out there.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.600]   And it was like at a conference,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.040]   like one of these conferences they used to do
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.840]   for rich people, basically.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.640]   And the rich people come, and then a bunch of speakers
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.120]   and writers come and give talks and stuff.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.800]   And the speakers and writers come
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.420]   because they want to meet the other speakers and writers.
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.680]   And then the rich people come because they want to hear
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.920]   from the speakers and writers.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.840]   It's kind of a weird thing, but kind of a cool thing.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.160]   And it was in Kent, Connecticut.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.800]   So Michael Pollan was there because he still kept that house
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.160]   in Kent, Connecticut.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.000]   And who else was there?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.800]   Henry Kissinger was there, because he turns out
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.520]   to have a house in Kent, Connecticut.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.080]   He's very old now, but he was there as well.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.120]   But that was interesting.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.320]   So that's when I learned like,
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.760]   oh, Pollan has the house here.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.200]   And I can tell you, it's like a beautiful town.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.080]   It has like this kind of fancy main street,
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.560]   and then it's all hills and trees.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.280]   And I get why people flee New York to move to Kent.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.700]   And so that's my Kent, Connecticut story.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.000]   All right, but let's get back to Little Bets.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.640]   So Little Bets was a concept I talked about
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.400]   in So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.580]   It was coined by, I believe the author's name was Sims.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.340]   Maybe Phil Sims?
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.740]   Yeah, I'm not quite sure.
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.580]   Do you have it, Jesse?
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.580]   You could look it up, right?
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.000]   - Well, Phil Sims is definitely a NFL quarterback.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.840]   So I was just saying-
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.580]   - He's an NFL quarterback who also writes
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.820]   about business strategy in his book, Little Bets.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.820]   All right, so probably not Phil Sims.
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.420]   Can you do like a Joe Rogan, Jamie thing here
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.820]   and see if we can find out?
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.660]   No, I feel bad.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.820]   I feel bad that I'm using the wrong name.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.300]   Anyways, I think the guy's name was Sims.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.500]   I mean, this is a decade ago I wrote this book.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.220]   But it was a self-explanatory concept
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.260]   of in your career, in your business,
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.340]   what you wanna try to do is take steps
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.820]   for which you can get feedback.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.460]   And then you can see, and that can direct it.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.300]   Oh, I get feedback.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.500]   Like this isn't resonating, this is.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.340]   So let me go that direction.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.540]   Let me try a couple more bets.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.780]   And by making sequential bets
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.940]   and making your future actions based on the feedback
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.980]   from those bets, you can actually have
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.820]   like an evidence-based way of guiding what you do.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.100]   And this is better than he would argue
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.580]   coming up with a huge big plan in abstract.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.180]   And then like, I'm gonna go execute this three-year plan.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.140]   And I hope it goes well.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.460]   So Sims was saying, take bets and get feedback.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.580]   - John Sims?
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.420]   - Is it John Sims?
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.420]   That doesn't sound right.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.260]   Can you find the book, Little Bets on?
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.100]   - I'll look for it.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.940]   - Yeah, like Amazon or something like that.
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.340]   If it is Phil Sims, that'd be awesome.
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.780]   If the quarterback was writing that book.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.500]   - Phil Sims is on Mad Dog every Friday.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.180]   I love that spot.
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.660]   - Okay, so Phil Sims is on Mad Dog every Friday
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.260]   talking like Harvard Business Review style career strategy.
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.540]   Like Mad Dog, let me talk to you about getting feedback
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.540]   from the right market segments on your consulting firm.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.980]   So Joe, I mean, I think the key thing to take away
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.460]   from Little Bets is-
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.420]   - Peter Sims.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.740]   - Peter Sims.
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.580]   I was close.
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.420]   - Yeah.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.260]   - Yeah, Phil Peter.
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.660]   Peter Sims, little known fact, younger brother
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.620]   of NFL quarterback Phil Sims.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.340]   I'm just gonna put that out there.
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.420]   Just gonna declare that.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.740]   So the feedback's what's key.
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.660]   So Joe, the feedback's what's key, right?
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.100]   And so I'm thinking about your situation.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.740]   Yeah, at some point, as you get feedback
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.220]   and you move along, you get to the place
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.340]   where the steps are pretty big.
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.580]   But if you're thinking about a book,
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.420]   you're writing a book now,
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.700]   but how did you come to write that book?
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.900]   Hopefully there is a sequence of Little Bets
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.300]   where you are finding these ideas, what resonates,
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.860]   what seems to have an audience.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.500]   And so you have this clear feedback before you actually go
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.100]   to the stage of writing a book about it.
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.300]   I think that's a clear example.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.340]   I mean, take something like my most recent book,
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.740]   "A World Without Email."
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.220]   How many years can you go back
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.180]   and hear me talking about these things?
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.140]   When you can go back and like my first appearance
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.340]   on the Ezra Klein podcast years ago,
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.620]   I'm working through a bunch of the core ideas
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.620]   that became "A World Without Email," right?
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.660]   Years before.
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.580]   How many articles that I write?
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.900]   There's actually an article I wrote
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.740]   for the Harvard Business Review to promote deep work.
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.620]   So all the way back in 2016,
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.380]   that was about getting rid of email
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.700]   and working through some concepts
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.760]   that made their way into the book.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.500]   So years of why workout concepts in my Little Bets,
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.840]   or I write about them, or I talk about them on this podcast,
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.260]   or I talk about them on other podcasts,
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.100]   or I write articles about them and I see what the response is.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.700]   So like I'm thinking now I might write a book
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.860]   about slow productivity.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.580]   I've been testing out this idea.
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.900]   I wrote a New Yorker piece about it,
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.640]   got some pretty good feedback that was useful.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.860]   I did a podcast video about this, a core idea video
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.700]   that was useful.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.980]   I talked about it on Tim Ferriss' podcast.
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.780]   And I could see when he split up that interview
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.640]   into segments, he did a clip
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.220]   of the slow productivity discussion,
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.300]   and that's the most viewed clip
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.820]   of all the clips he did from the podcast.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.820]   That's feedback on this.
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.020]   So those are Little Bets that are helping me put together
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.260]   what I wanna do, and at some point
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.140]   I'm gonna write a book about it.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.060]   So Joe, I would say that's the takeaway message
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.460]   is you wanna get real feedback from people,
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.060]   not people like friends, but actual unbiased feedback.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.900]   Are you buying this?
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.720]   Are you paying for this?
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.560]   Are you giving me money?
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.900]   And allow that to help direct you
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.020]   towards which direction you go.
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.780]   But I think you're absolutely right to point out
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.340]   that a Little Bet strategy will eventually lead you
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.900]   to really big things that take time.
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.540]   You do a lot of bets on topics,
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.580]   you might then end up spending two years writing a book.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.780]   Do a bunch of little bets on a product,
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.700]   you might end up at some point taking on investment
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.020]   and going all in on a business.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.100]   And that's a multi-year commitment one way or the other.
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.920]   So that's true.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.380]   Little Bets lead to big commitments,
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.760]   but the key is not to jump right into that big commitment
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.820]   just because you hope or you have a reasonable story
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.420]   about why what you're gonna do would be useful,
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.220]   that you actually have some evidence.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.140]   And if you doubt that, talk to NFL quarterback, Phil Sims.
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.140]   He will fill your ear.
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.860]   He will fill your ear with thoughts on Little Bets.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.020]   - All right, that's a blast for the past.
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.100]   So Good They Can't Ignore You was 2012.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.880]   So yeah, we're at the 10-year anniversary.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.620]   Interesting.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.220]   That's when I kicked off my writing career
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.140]   as a non-fiction idea book writer.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.060]   I wrote these three books for students.
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.740]   That's how I got my sea legs,
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.880]   that's how I built up my craft.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.940]   And So Good They Can't Ignore You
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.060]   was the vision I had all along of,
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.220]   I wanna write idea books, non-fiction books,
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.060]   Table at Barnes & Noble, On NPR, New York Times articles.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.540]   That's what I wanted to do.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.340]   And that's where I kicked off that transition.
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.220]   So it's a really important book for me.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.260]   It was the first time someone said,
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.580]   "Okay, you're allowed to write a hardcover book
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.420]   "about an idea, it's a crazy thing.
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.920]   "Just an idea you made up.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.520]   "And you can just put that in a book
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.140]   "and we'll see what happens."
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.380]   So that was definitely a big transition for me.
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.300]   - That's a cool story.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.460]   - Yeah.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.700]   And it was good, that book went to auction.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.340]   And at the time it seemed like a lot of money.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.740]   It's how we bought our first,
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.860]   it was the down payment for our first house
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.300]   and how we bought our first car
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.980]   as we came out to Georgetown.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.540]   Because that book was really,
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.060]   I wrote it right before I came out here.
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.100]   And it came out right after I got here, it's my memory.
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.980]   My memory is right after I got to Georgetown it came out.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.620]   But I wrote it as a postdoc.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.460]   So it was exciting, it was some money
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.540]   and not like life-changing money,
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.540]   but bigger by far, like factor of five bigger
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.220]   than I was getting for the student books or whatever.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.340]   And then it didn't do well out of the gates.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.700]   So there's a story in that.
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:21.500]   There's a big push, we hired a good PR company
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.260]   and it just kind of disappeared.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.380]   We're like, "Oh man, I guess."
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.620]   'Cause I didn't know how publicity,
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.020]   I had no idea how book sales work.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.060]   I still don't know how that works.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.100]   And it's like, "Okay, I guess,
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.220]   "do I get to keep doing this?
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.140]   "I don't know."
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.780]   And so I pitched them deep work finally into like,
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.100]   "Yeah, but we're gonna pay you less money,
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.180]   "but if you wanna write it, go ahead."
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.220]   And it was just a funny thing.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.580]   It's just good ideas are good ideas.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.620]   And it took years, but then it just,
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.620]   it picked up and sold hundreds of thousands of copies.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.260]   But it was, it seemed like a dud out of the gate.
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.540]   And I'll say the two things that seemed to matter
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.660]   was podcasting came along
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.180]   about two years after I wrote that book.
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.140]   So I wrote that book,
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.780]   I did a thing for the New York Times
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.860]   and like it got a good,
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.380]   there's a few things I did,
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.420]   it kind of disappeared.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.140]   And it's some radio, but some stupid radio.
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.620]   And then starting around 2014,
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.580]   podcasting became a thing.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.460]   And so I became, I was like a very early guest
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.780]   in podcasting circuits,
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.820]   doing a lot of these early podcasts.
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.740]   And I just did a lot of podcasts,
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.580]   like why not?
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.420]   I thought it was fun.
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.980]   And I think that built the slow burn.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.060]   If there for like 2014 to 2016,
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.340]   I was on a lot of shows.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.820]   And that's how I got kind of good at it
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.100]   because I was doing podcasting really early on.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.220]   And I sort of learned the medium.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.140]   And I think that's what really,
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.300]   two years after it came out,
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.180]   started that burn.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.340]   And then Deep Work did something similar,
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.180]   but its burn was much more intense.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.580]   Like that book sold a lot of copies.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.980]   And I think that also just pointed people back
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.980]   towards that original book.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.380]   So that's how it all got started for me.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.660]   I was, got real excited,
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.580]   got this deal, got this book,
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.020]   it disappeared,
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.980]   thought that I'd be done with publishing.
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.620]   And then podcasting came along
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.540]   and Deep Work came along.
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.380]   And that's actually like a,
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.260]   turned out to be a very successful book.
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.100]   - The other thing too,
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.980]   you talk about and others talk about is,
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.300]   you have, you had another job too.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.460]   So you weren't relying on that to survive.
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.580]   So I mean, you could like give it some time.
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.460]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.940]   I don't, it would have been harder if I was,
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.340]   well, what happened in the nonfiction space.
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.500]   - Much more stressful.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.620]   - And you have to become like a super speaker.
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.380]   That's what was happening back then.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.860]   If you were trying to make a living
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.460]   off of nonfiction advice books,
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.460]   you had to be doing 30 to 50 speeches a year.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.620]   And like what a lot of writers would do in that space.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.820]   And it's very lucrative by the way,
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.380]   but it's tough.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.620]   But a lot of writers would just do year on year off.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.260]   So like 50 speeches, killer.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.460]   And then a year writing,
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.740]   then 50 speeches a year writing.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.220]   And you always had to have the book came out.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.380]   And then your whole life is built around the speaking.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.140]   So fortunately I was a professor
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.460]   and so I didn't have to do that.
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.340]   I could just say, I don't know,
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.220]   I guess this book didn't do well.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.060]   I waited a long time.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.460]   That book came out in 2012.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.300]   And then I didn't,
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.300]   Deep Work came out four years later.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.980]   So I was having kids and trying to get tenure.
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.340]   And so that was kind of a fun time actually.
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.380]   I mean, there's something innocent to it.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.860]   I would do, it was entirely homegrown.
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.940]   This is the way I remember it.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.940]   Is like I would do podcast in my basement and that was it.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.580]   And then at some point I started writing Deep Work
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.780]   just sort of on my own and that was it.
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.500]   And then everything else was just organic.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.500]   And so that's my view.
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.100]   If a book is right,
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.100]   it will eventually sell a lot of copies
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.060]   regardless of what happens early on.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.260]   I don't know how to make a book
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.220]   sell a lot of copies right up front.
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.820]   I've never been able to do that.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.660]   - It's kind of like what the book says.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.100]   It's so good you can't ignore you.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.900]   So if like the book is good,
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:35.820]   it can't be ignored.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:36.780]   - Yeah, I don't think anyone knows.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.380]   Like my editor, I love the editor on that book.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.460]   He's like, this is a great idea.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.860]   Like this, and he was right in the end,
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.740]   we sold a ton of copies of that book.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.700]   But he was like baffled.
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.940]   He's like, why aren't we early on?
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.660]   Why isn't, why is no one buying this?
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.460]   It's such, I just don't think people understand
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.500]   or they don't understand the degree to which
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.540]   like email lists, these other types of dynamics
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.580]   and cultural, your cultural awareness.
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.380]   Like this stuff plays a huge role
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.380]   in things like taking off right out of the back.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.780]   But it's almost like that's orthogonal
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.060]   from whether or not the book is gonna be.
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.500]   So we'll see, we'll see.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.380]   But it was a cool story.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.300]   So that started that whole chapter of my life,
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.220]   which was, that was an interesting one.
