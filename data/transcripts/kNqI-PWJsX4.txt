[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   So you're a curious lover of science.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.640]   What do you think of the efforts that Elon Musk is doing with space exploration, with
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.000]   electric vehicles, with autopilot sort of getting into the space of autonomous vehicles,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.680]   with boring under LA, and Neuralink trying to communicate brain-machine interfaces, communicate
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.920]   between machines and human brains?
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.120]   Well, it's really inspiring.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.600]   I mean, look at the fandom that he's amassed.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.760]   It's not common for someone like that to have such a following.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.760]   And so it's-
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.760]   Engineering nerd.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.240]   So it's really exciting, but I also think that a lot of responsibility comes with that kind
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.240]   of power.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.920]   So if I met him, I would love to hear how he feels about the responsibility he has when
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.280]   there are people who are such a fan of your ideas and your dreams and share them so closely
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.040]   with you.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.040]   You have a lot of power.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.080]   And he didn't always have that.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.160]   He wasn't born as Elon Musk.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.320]   Well, he was, but well, he was named that later.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.320]   But the point is that I want to know the psychology of becoming a figure like him.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.520]   Well, I don't even know how to phrase the question right, but it's a question about
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:34.840]   what do you do when you're following, your fans become so large that it's almost bigger
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.600]   than you?
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.360]   And how do you responsibly manage that?
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.840]   And maybe it doesn't worry him at all, and that's fine too, but I'd be really curious.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.120]   And I think there are a lot of people that go through this when they realize, "Whoa,
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.120]   there are a lot of eyes on me."
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.640]   There are a lot of people who really take what I say very earnestly and take it to heart
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.320]   and will defend me.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:05.960]   And that can be dangerous and you have to be responsible with it.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.800]   Both in terms of impact on society and psychologically for the individual, just the burden psychologically
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   on Elon?
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.320]   How does he think about that part of his persona?
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:27.240]   Well, let me throw that right back at you, because in some ways you're just a funny guy
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.320]   that's gotten a humongous following, a funny guy with a curiosity.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.960]   You've got a huge following.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.560]   How do you psychologically deal with the responsibility?
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.040]   In many ways, you have a reach in many ways bigger than Elon Musk.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.520]   What is the burden that you feel in educating, being one of the biggest educators in the
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.840]   world where everybody's listening to you?
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:00.040]   And actually, most of the world that uses YouTube for educational material trust you
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.960]   as a source of good, strong scientific thinking.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:14.480]   It's a burden and I try to approach it with a lot of humility and sharing.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.500]   I'm not out there doing a lot of scientific experiments.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.640]   I am sharing the work of real scientists and I'm celebrating their work and the way that
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.840]   they think and the power of curiosity.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.560]   But I want to make it clear at all times that, look, we don't know all the answers and I
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.960]   don't think we're ever going to reach a point where we're like, "Wow, and there you go.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   That's the universe.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.960]   It's this equation.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.360]   You plug in some conditions or whatever and you do the math and you know what's going
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   to happen tomorrow."
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.320]   I don't think we're ever going to reach that point.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:54.360]   But I think that there is a tendency to sometimes believe in science and become elitist and
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.920]   become, I don't know, hard, when in reality it should humble you and make you feel smaller.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.680]   I think there's something very beautiful about feeling very, very small and very weak and
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.280]   to feel that you need other people.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.640]   So I try to keep that in mind and say, "Look, thanks for watching.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.100]   Vsauce is not, I'm not Vsauce, you are."
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.480]   When I start the episodes, I say, "Hey, Vsauce, Michael here."
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.960]   Vsauce and Michael are actually a different thing in my mind.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.480]   I don't know if that's always clear, but yeah, I have to approach it that way because it's
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.480]   not about me.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.960]   So it's not even, you're not feeling responsibility.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.120]   You're just sort of plugging into this big thing that is scientific exploration of our
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.440]   reality and you're a voice that represents a bunch, but you're just plugging into this
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.000]   big Vsauce ball that others, millions of others are plugged into.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:01.560]   So I try to encourage curiosity and responsible thinking and an embracement of doubt and being
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.680]   okay with that.
