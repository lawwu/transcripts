[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   What do you think about the will to power?
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.560]   What do you think drives humans?
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.560]   Is it ...
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.120]   - Oh, an unholy mix of things.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.520]   I don't think there's one pure, simple, and elegant objective function driving humans
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.520]   by any means.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.600]   - What do you think ... I know it's hard to look at humans in an aggregate, but do you
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.480]   think overall humans are good, or do we have both good and evil within us that, depending
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.360]   on the circumstances, depending on whatever can percolate to the top?
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.960]   - Good and evil are very ambiguous, complicated, and in some ways silly concepts.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.680]   But if we could dig into your question from a couple directions.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:59.440]   So I think if you look in evolution, humanity is shaped both by individual selection and
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.800]   what biologists would call group selection, like tribe level selection, right?
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.640]   So individual selection has driven us in a selfish DNA sort of way, so that each of us
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.360]   does to a certain approximation what will help us propagate our DNA to future generations.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.960]   I mean, that's why I've got four kids so far, and probably that's not the last one.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.960]   On the other hand ...
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.960]   - I like the ambition.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.880]   - Tribal, like group selection, means humans in a way will do what will advocate for the
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.280]   persistence of the DNA of their whole tribe, or their social group.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.820]   And in biology, you have both of these, right?
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.220]   And you can see, say, an ant colony or a beehive, there's a lot of group selection in the evolution
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.960]   of those social animals.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.240]   On the other hand, say, a big cat or some very solitary animal, it's a lot more biased
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.820]   toward individual selection.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.360]   Humans are an interesting balance, and I think this reflects itself in what we would view
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.800]   as selfishness versus altruism, to some extent.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:15.000]   So we just have both of those objective functions contributing to the makeup of our brains.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.680]   And then, as Nietzsche analyzed in his own way, and others have analyzed in different
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.400]   ways, I mean, we abstract this as, well, we have both good and evil within us, right?
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.160]   Because a lot of what we view as evil is really just selfishness, and a lot of what we view
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.300]   as good is altruism, which means doing what's good for the tribe.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.180]   And on that level, we have both of those just baked into us, and that's how it is.
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.660]   Of course, there are psychopaths and sociopaths and people who get gratified by the suffering
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.160]   of others, and that's a different thing.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.360]   - Yeah, those are exceptions, but on the whole.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.440]   - Yeah, but I think at core, we're not purely selfish, we're not purely altruistic, we are
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.200]   a mix, and that's the nature of it.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:17.400]   And we also have a complex constellation of values that are just very specific to our
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   evolutionary history.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.380]   We love waterways and mountains, and the ideal place to put a house is on a mountain overlooking
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.380]   the water, right?
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.940]   And we care a lot about our kids, and we care a little less about our cousins, and even
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.280]   less about our fifth cousins.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   I mean, there are many particularities to human values, which, whether they're good
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.600]   or evil, depends on your perspective.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.720]   I spent a lot of time in Ethiopia, in Addis Ababa, where we have one of our AI development
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.600]   offices for my SingularityNet project.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:03.440]   And when I walk through the streets in Addis, there's people lying by the side of the road,
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.120]   living there by the side of the road, dying probably of curable diseases without enough
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.960]   food or medicine.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.480]   And when I walk by them, I feel terrible, I give them money.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.520]   When I come back home to the developed world, they're not on my mind that much.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.660]   I do donate some, but I also spend some of the limited money I have enjoying myself in
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.240]   frivolous ways, rather than donating it to those people who are right now starving, dying,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.040]   and suffering on the roadside.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.720]   So, does that make me evil?
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.000]   I mean, it makes me somewhat selfish and somewhat altruistic, and we each balance that in our
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.440]   own way, right?
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:51.160]   So, whether that will be true of all possible AGIs is a subtler question.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   That's how humans are.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.240]   - So, you have a sense, you kind of mentioned that there's a selfish, I'm not gonna bring
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.120]   up the whole Ayn Rand idea of selfishness being the core virtue, that's a whole interesting
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.320]   kind of tangent that I think we'll just distract ourselves on.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.480]   - I have to make one amusing comment.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.480]   - Sure.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.080]   - A comment that has amused me anyway.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.520]   So, I have extraordinary negative respect for Ayn Rand.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.320]   - Negative, what's a negative respect?
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.800]   - When I worked with a company called Genescient, which was evolving flies to have extraordinary
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.240]   long lives in Southern California.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.200]   So we had flies that were evolved by artificial selection to have five times the lifespan
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.960]   of normal fruit flies, but the population of super long-lived flies was physically sitting
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.120]   in a spare room at an Ayn Rand elementary school in Southern California.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.080]   So that was just like, well, if I saw this in a movie, I wouldn't believe it.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.800]   - Well, yeah, the universe has a sense of humor in that kind of way.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.760]   That fits in, humor fits in somehow into this whole absurd existence.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:08.240]   But you mentioned the balance between selfishness and altruism as kind of being innate.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.400]   Do you think it's possible that's kind of an emergent phenomenon, those peculiarities
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.520]   of our value system?
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.240]   How much of it is innate?
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.560]   How much of it is something we collectively, kind of like a Dostoevsky novel, bring to
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.440]   life together as a civilization?
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.120]   - I mean, the answer to nature versus nurture is usually both.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.800]   And of course, it's nature versus nurture versus self-organization, as you mentioned.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.780]   So clearly, there are evolutionary roots to individual and group selection leading to
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.880]   a mix of selfishness and altruism.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.720]   On the other hand, different cultures manifest that in different ways.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.480]   Well, we all have basically the same biology.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:00.680]   And if you look at sort of pre-civilized cultures, you have tribes like the Yanomamo in Venezuela,
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.520]   which their culture is focused on killing other tribes.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.800]   And you have other Stone Age tribes that are mostly peaceable and have big taboos against
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   violence.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.240]   So you can certainly have a big difference in how culture manifests these innate biological
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240]   characteristics.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.600]   But still, you know, there's probably limits that are given by our biology.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.280]   I used to argue this with my great-grandparents, who were Marxists, actually, because they
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.320]   believed in the withering away of the state.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:42.280]   They believed that as you move from capitalism to socialism to communism, people would just
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:49.380]   become more social-minded, so that a state would be unnecessary, and everyone would give
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.040]   everyone else what they needed.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.520]   Now, setting aside that that's not what the various Marxist experiments on the planet
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:04.680]   seemed to be heading toward in practice, just as a theoretical point, I was very dubious
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.480]   that human nature could go there.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.040]   Like at that time, when my great-grandparents were alive, I was just like, you know, I'm
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.160]   a cynical teenager.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.000]   I think humans are just jerks.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.080]   The state is not going to wither away.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.200]   If you don't have some structure keeping people from screwing each other over, they're going
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   to do it.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   So now I actually don't quite see things that way.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.520]   I mean, I think my feeling now, subjectively, is the culture aspect is more significant
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.680]   than I thought it was when I was a teenager.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:42.960]   And I think you could have a human society that was dialed dramatically further toward
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.040]   self-awareness, other awareness, compassion, and sharing than our current society.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:54.400]   And of course, greater material abundance helps, but to some extent, material abundance
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.240]   is a subjective perception also, because many Stone Age cultures perceived themselves as
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.640]   living in great material abundance.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.040]   They had all the food and water they wanted.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.720]   They lived in a beautiful place.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.560]   They had sex lives.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   They had children.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.980]   I mean, they had abundance without any factories, right?
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:21.640]   So I think humanity probably would be capable of fundamentally more positive and joy-filled
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:27.440]   mode of social existence than what we have now.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.720]   Clearly, Marx didn't quite have the right idea about how to get there.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:40.560]   I mean, he missed a number of key aspects of human society and its evolution.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.280]   And if we look at where we are in society now, how to get there is a quite different
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:52.120]   question because there are very powerful forces pushing people in different directions than
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.880]   a positive, joyous, compassionate existence, right?
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:05.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:15.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
