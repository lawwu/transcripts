[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Hello everybody, it's Sam and Sydney from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.120]   And in this episode, I want to talk to my wife about what the latest thoughts are regarding
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.040]   upgrading homes.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.680]   A couple of months ago, I had an episode that talked about trying to convince my wife, Sydney,
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.160]   to upgrade homes, and I was met with a lot, a lot of resistance.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.380]   But two months later, it seems like things have changed a little bit.
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.720]   And I wanted to ask you, Sydney, what has changed?
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.760]   Why do you think upgrading homes now could be a good idea?
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.120]   Well, like you said, a lot has changed.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.040]   And the main thing that comes to mind is when we had our initial conversation, I was not
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.440]   in a good headspace.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.760]   The timing was off for me.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.620]   I had a lot going on with my mom, because I was preparing for a big trip overseas to
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.620]   Japan.
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.860]   I had a lot of issues preparing for it and dealing with logistics.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.180]   And mentally, I was at capacity.
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.000]   I just couldn't envision doing anything besides getting through that trip and getting back.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.180]   So that was my main thing.
[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.740]   I just mentally, I couldn't comprehend having to think about moving, because moving is a
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.740]   big deal.
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.060]   I mean, some people are used to it, but for me, I'm not so used to it.
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.500]   Okay, so you're back from Japan, and things went well.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.580]   So it's been, what, a month since you've been back?
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.580]   And so now, how is your headspace?
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.500]   It's a lot better for sure.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.820]   I have done a lot of thinking, a lot of talking with you.
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.020]   And once I felt calm enough to actually recognize that this was something that you are definitely
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.180]   taking very seriously, I sat down and put together a list of pros and cons of staying
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.940]   versus moving, and really put a lot of thought into it.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:13.380]   And I felt like you, after going through everything, that yeah, it could be a wonderful change
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.900]   for us.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.900]   What are some of the pros and some of the cons?
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.500]   Let's just talk about three pros and three cons.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.340]   One pro is that we like the area.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.820]   It's new for us.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.180]   It's quieter, and it's just very peaceful there.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:42.420]   Second pro would be the layout and the space is different than what we have, and I think
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.260]   it would be really fun.
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.620]   The third one would be just going on a new adventure, like you were saying.
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.780]   I think we're ready for something new.
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.700]   And then some of the cons?
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.060]   Just the fact that we are happy here already.
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:08.620]   We don't feel like we're unhappy, so we are taking a risk of going somewhere new where
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.380]   there could be some unknowns.
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.340]   So there's that potential of being in a different type of environment for us.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.220]   Another one would be we don't know the neighbors.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.320]   That's always a risk, right?
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.700]   Sometimes you could end up having a crazy neighbor.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.220]   We've talked to some people in the area, and they seem to be great, so I think it would
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.740]   be fine, but that's still an unknown.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:41.420]   The con of spending time and money to go through a move.
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.300]   It takes a lot of time to go through that.
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.420]   What's interesting is one of the cons you don't bring about is the cost of actually
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.820]   paying a lot more for a new house.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.300]   And I wonder, is it because you don't feel the responsibility of generating the income
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.180]   to come up with the funds to buy the house?
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.060]   Because for me, that is one of the top three cons for sure that kind of weighs on me in
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.860]   terms of, man, I've got to spend a lot of money, and then there's more property taxes,
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.340]   more maintenance, and that's going to be a heavier or brighter burn in terms of monthly
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.700]   expenses.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.560]   We have definitely talked about this, and that was one of my biggest holdbacks initially
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.820]   is that the numbers were not something that I felt comfortable with in the beginning.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.420]   And that's why, on top of the stress, I just couldn't imagine it being the right move for
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.940]   us at the time.
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.760]   However, we had a lot of discussion since then.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.300]   We looked carefully at the numbers, and I feel that we arrived at a place together where
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.060]   we both felt comfortable with it.
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:57.440]   But yes, it's obviously a significant factor in moving houses, and I do think that's the
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.520]   main thing that you bear, your responsibility.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.600]   And I obviously am involved with that as well.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:14.680]   But I feel that I'm in a much more comfortable place about the finances now than before we
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.460]   had a lot of discussions about it and really dug into the numbers.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.440]   Just for our listeners, if you're interested, we plan to pay cash for the house.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:31.160]   We plan to pay cash by selling some stocks and some various bonds, perhaps, some treasury
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.920]   bonds for sure, that have expiring maturity dates.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.620]   And so the way I think about it is it's almost like just an asset transfer.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.300]   Since 2022, stocks have rebounded.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.180]   They're definitely up more than 20% since October 2022.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.020]   And in terms of house prices, the house prices in the segment that we're looking at have
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.020]   come down.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:00.540]   San Francisco overall, I think from 2022 to 2023, home prices are down about 8.5%, the
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.980]   median home price.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.960]   And it started to take back up a little starting in the second quarter of 2023.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.380]   So the way I see it is, OK, we can upgrade homes.
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.780]   One of the biggest complaints is there's not a lot of inventory.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.100]   But if you can find that perfect home in a low inventory environment, right now I think
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.220]   could be a great time to buy because you've identified that home.
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.020]   And there's not a lot of competition because mortgage rates are up.
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.700]   And so if you have a lower priced home while your stocks are rebounding, then it's kind
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.740]   of like, wow, my stocks have rebounded and I actually buy something that I want.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.540]   This sounds like a good asset transfer.
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.360]   So it's not taking on debt at this point in the cycle.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.180]   It's just transferring assets from stocks and treasury bonds to a home that we would
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.820]   live in.
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.300]   So just FYI for those folks listening.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.980]   In terms of one of your main concerns on whether this is the right move or not, you talked
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:07.680]   about just the uncertainty of the move and whether because we're already happy in our
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.940]   existing home.
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.200]   And so I thought about that a lot.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.160]   And at a certain point, I think all of us reach a level of financial stability where
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.140]   we're happy being able to provide food, clothing, shelter, transportation, education to our
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.140]   family children.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.660]   And we really don't need much more than the basics.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.100]   And so one of the things that I've struggled with the most is buying a home we just don't
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.100]   need.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.100]   It's like, we just bought this home in 2020.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.540]   Why do we have to buy another home in 2023?
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.540]   And so my biggest fear, and I heard you loud and clear back when we started debating about
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:50.520]   whether to buy another home, was us buying another home, leaving a home that we're already
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.980]   happy with, and you not being happy in the new home.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.460]   And the kids not happy in the new home.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.460]   That's one of my biggest fears.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.860]   Because then I'll be like, well, I just shot myself in the foot thinking that this would
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.420]   provide for a better lifestyle for our family for the next 10 plus years.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.260]   And yet we're not happier or you're actually unhappy.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:18.460]   So can you share your thoughts on that worry that I have?
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.900]   Yeah, it's totally understandable.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.700]   And I think in any kind of huge decision like this, when you're in a partnership, in a marriage,
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:33.340]   you have to both be on board to successfully take the step forward.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:40.100]   And we have had countless discussions offline together about this.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.900]   We talked it through and I got to a point where I felt that I could emotionally let
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:45.900]   go.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.180]   And I think one thing with me is in any kind of big decision, I don't like to yo-yo back
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.180]   and forth.
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.700]   I can't take that emotional uncertainty.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.220]   And I wasn't ready to do that when we had our initial conversation on the podcast.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:11.100]   So over time with additional conversations and analysis and thinking about it, I got
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:20.420]   to the point where I felt that I was emotionally ready to move forward and let go of our current
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.260]   home and welcome the new house.
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.460]   And I am fully on board with that now.
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.020]   And I know that we are going to be happy.
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.060]   There will be unexpected variables.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.420]   I'm not going to say that there won't be, that just life, there's always going to be
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.180]   something that you don't expect.
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.860]   And I think there are so many positives.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.860]   Kids are excited.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.740]   We're moving forward, united on this decision.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.740]   And I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.380]   My fear is that I'm too good of a salesman.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.860]   So if I listen to the podcast regarding our debate, you are no, no, no, no, why move when
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.860]   we're already happy.
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.460]   And I was trying to sell you on the other side.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:09.780]   So now that I've succeeded in selling you on the move, now I actually worry.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.380]   I worry, uh-oh.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.780]   I feel like I could sell you going back to staying in our home.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.780]   That's my problem.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.340]   I feel like I'm too good of a salesperson to convince you to do something that I am
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.620]   almost like bullying you into doing something that you don't really want to do.
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.780]   Not at all.
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.020]   And I think what, you know, we've actually had the opposite, right?
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.020]   There were some unexpected things that came up where you were like, "Okay, maybe this
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.340]   isn't the right decision."
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.820]   And I had to explain to you that I am comfortable with it.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.940]   We're going to work through these issues and that this is the right decision for us as
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.940]   a family.
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:56.980]   And as you know, I personally take a longer time to come around to change than you.
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.540]   And I needed, this has happened in the last move that we made, right?
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.580]   You were ready to move and I wasn't.
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.140]   I needed more time.
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.940]   And then I got to the point where I was ready to commit and then we took the steps forward
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:10.940]   together.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.580]   And I think the same thing has happened here.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:18.980]   I wasn't ready, you know, several months ago and then now I am.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:25.180]   And I just need, I need more time to mentally prepare for change and to think through all
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.300]   of the different pros and cons.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.500]   And you know, I just take longer to process things.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.500]   I guess so.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:39.700]   It's interesting because when I was talking to other guys about this dilemma that we have,
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:47.940]   it was rare for them to say, well, it's rare for a situation where a husband or wife, whatever,
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:56.060]   has identified a nicer home than they currently exist in and getting so much resistance for
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.140]   wanting to buy that nicer home.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:02.300]   So I think that's rare in the sense that you are, we're creatures of habit, we're comfortable
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.580]   and shows that you're comfortable with what you have.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:11.060]   You're happy with what you have, which is a good sign and you don't need more.
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:17.580]   And that's, that is kind of the conflict internally that I'm trying to think about as we get older
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.260]   and hopefully wealthier.
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.840]   I think most listeners will get wealthier over time and they'll have an excess amount
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.340]   of money than they figure out what to do with so that they don't waste all that energy and
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:34.580]   effort that they initially expended to earn and make that money.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.620]   So in terms of that emotional attachment, you know, I hear you on the emotional attachment,
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:44.120]   which is why I wrote a post called five ways to overcome emotional attachment to buy a
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.700]   new home.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.580]   And one of the ways to overcome that emotional attachment is to tell yourself it's not the
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.180]   home, it's the people around you.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.340]   And so do you believe it's really you're confusing the attachment to the home that we currently
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:03.780]   live in versus really it's your attachment to the three of us, your two children and
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.780]   me?
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:11.180]   And for me, it's also just, you know, how much stress I can handle.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:17.700]   At the time, you know, initially I could not mentally take anything else in terms of big
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.220]   changes and I just, I was at my mental limit.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:32.260]   And fortunately I'm in a much better headspace now and we were able to have a lot more discussions
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.260]   about everything.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.540]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:41.260]   It's very important that you bring up your mental limit because I think we all have different
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.640]   levels of mental capacity, right?
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:50.620]   Maybe I have like a super tanker storage facility of mental stress that I can deal with.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.980]   And maybe you have a smaller capacity, right?
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.780]   So it's very different.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.460]   So if we have different mental limits, like we have different strengths, different endurance
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:08.300]   levels, different anything, I think we need to be aware of that because it's not a default
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:13.860]   setting where we all have the same ability to, let's say, rise early or work certain
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.940]   amount of hours.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:20.740]   And I feel, I'm afraid that one day my mental capacity won't be able to deal with as much
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.920]   stress as possible.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:28.900]   So the way I envision it is once your mental stress load or capacity is limited, it overflows
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.180]   into my bucket and it fills up my bucket, right?
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:37.280]   And so that's my duty as the husband to try to, you know, work harder or try to calm you
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.260]   down or make sure everything's okay, you know, take care of the kids, whatever it is, right?
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.180]   Just to be there as the backup, like the backup generator.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:53.820]   And my fear is that as I get older, slower, weaker, less mentally with it, that my mental
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.300]   capacity will decline.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:00.720]   Unfortunately, it's sad, but that's kind of the way things are with life.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.680]   And so if we move and then I have to deal with another set of tenants, if we don't sell
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:10.660]   our existing house, my ability to take in your stress and deal with my own stresses
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.060]   will decline.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:18.580]   And what's also really sad, I think, but also fascinating is that we both don't have day
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.020]   jobs, right?
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.420]   We both set our --
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.180]   Traditional day jobs.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.180]   Traditional day jobs.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:28.020]   But still, I don't have to write, I don't have to record a podcast, I don't have to
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.020]   do nothing.
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.860]   I just have to ensure that our finances are stable, you know, I stay healthy, I pick up
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.980]   our son from school and send him.
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:41.200]   And now that our daughter's going to school three days a week, we have a lot of capacity.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.020]   So what is that law?
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:47.820]   It's like Parkinson's law or something where it's the work fills up the time you have to
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:48.820]   do the work.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:54.220]   It's like it doesn't really matter how much time you have, we're going to fill up that
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.660]   time at the pace that we have.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:05.140]   And so what are your thoughts on, you know, my fears on reaching my mental capacity limit?
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:12.920]   I think we all, in general, as a society, are under a lot of pressure.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:20.440]   And I guess we get so absorbed with so many things that we forget to self-care.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:27.640]   And I think, you know, even just taking, you know, two, three minutes a day or every other
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:33.620]   day to just block everything out and have quiet, I think, is really beneficial.
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:38.040]   There's all these little things that we can do to help decrease our stress, clear our
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:44.040]   heads, you know, and increase that mental capacity when it feels like it's going down.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:50.200]   Yeah, I always believe that if you feel mentally ill, treat it as a physical illness, take
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:57.380]   24 hours, drink a lot of water, get a lot of sleep, and recharge.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:04.360]   Because it is really interesting for me once we had kids about the stress that increased
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:09.040]   for me, whereas I thought, "Okay, well, we got kids now, so I got to provide, I got to
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.040]   earn the income, I got to asset allocate."
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:16.660]   You know, managing money is almost like a full-time job if you want it to be.
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:22.480]   And then to do the childcare and then to write on Financial Samurai and then to record and
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.280]   then to write the book, it just keeps on going on and on.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.480]   So it's an interesting situation where it's almost self-inflicted.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.480]   It is self-inflicted.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.800]   It's not inflicted, it's like it's our decision, right?
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:41.160]   So for folks who want to work and take care of children and all that, just know what you're
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.500]   getting yourself into.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.280]   Really carefully plan ahead and think through the steps.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.280]   Because it's not easy.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.680]   The more you have, the more stress and the more responsibility you need to take.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:58.880]   And if both partners' mental capacity and endurance is not equal, the one who has greater
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.960]   capacity will have to pick up the "slack," right?
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.840]   To make sure things are going to be okay.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.600]   And so, yeah, think twice, maybe think thrice about upgrading homes, which is where I'm
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.600]   at right now, right?
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.120]   In the beginning, two months ago or whenever we talked, I was really gung-ho about it.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.320]   I was like, "Okay, this is a great deal.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.600]   This is a house that I looked at last year for a much higher price.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.600]   It's lower now.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.040]   Our stocks have rebounded.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:32.240]   It's a great layout, large lot, really rare, and I think we'll be happy there."
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.160]   But now I'm thinking, "Okay, is this the right move for us?"
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:44.960]   I think this is kind of the pattern that you've had in the prior purchases that we've done,
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:52.040]   where initially it's very exciting, and then the closer it gets to actually happening,
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.600]   the reality of it sets in.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:19:00.480]   So that's when the anxieties start to come out more than initially when it's just thinking
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.940]   about how fun and exciting that it's going to be.
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.840]   So I think what you're feeling is completely natural.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:15.520]   It doesn't worry me because I know this is the pattern that you typically follow before
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.960]   a purchase.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.040]   It's good that you're getting all of your feelings out and you're really thinking it
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:29.480]   through because in any kind of purchase that's this big, you want to really be sure that
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.520]   it is what you want to do.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:36.200]   So I think you're just going through all of your thoughts.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.360]   It's always a little bit scary, as you've told me, before it happens.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.360]   And then...
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.360]   Right.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.040]   No, I hear you.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:52.240]   Every single home purchase that I've made, it's been very nerve-wracking, very scary.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.160]   I remember getting the phone call, something like June 6, 2020.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:02.960]   I was at the playground with our son, and I got a call from the realtor saying, "Congratulations.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.680]   The seller loved your real estate love letter, and they've accepted your offer."
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.760]   And I remember thinking to myself, "Ooh, great.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.480]   But okay, thank you so much."
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.200]   And I hung up and I sat on the seesaw, and I just thought about it.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.420]   I was like, "Oh no.
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.400]   After all that work, they accepted it.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.940]   Am I really going to go through with this?"
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.940]   And I felt this way with every single purchase since 2003.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.440]   Every single property, "Uh-oh.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.160]   Is this the right move?"
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.040]   And I would say every single one has worked out well, financially at least, but all of
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.200]   them have worked out well lifestyle-wise.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:49.000]   I think it's just a little different because of the financial responsibility that I feel
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.480]   the weight on my shoulders.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:57.740]   When we were back in 2012, when I left, I was like, "All right, let's just live a simple
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:05.360]   life in Hawaii on the mango farm, go surfing, eat off the fruit of the land, and then maybe
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:12.640]   we'll make $25,000 a year online and have some passive income, and that'll be great."
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:18.320]   And now life is a little bit more complicated, and I have to be careful not to go overboard
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:24.200]   because I think a lot of us want to spend our wealth, but a lot of us who are used to
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:32.080]   being frugal, investing heavily, and not buying things we don't need have this trepidation.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.660]   And then in the end, we end up with a lot when we're older, and then maybe we will regret
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.880]   not living it up as much as we could.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.760]   Do you have any thoughts on that?
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.540]   I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense.
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:55.380]   We typically aren't big spenders, so buying a home feels uncomfortable sometimes because
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:07.740]   of the significance of it to our financial situation.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.220]   So you're gung-ho on moving?
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.780]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:19.820]   And again, it took me a while to come around to it, and then I felt once I made my mind
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:24.500]   up, I felt comfortable with it 100%.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:30.900]   And there have been some unexpected things that we've had to consider, but I feel very
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:37.420]   comfortable with it, and I'm fully on board with the decision.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:44.900]   And let's say we move into the home, and I don't know, goodness forbid our son breaks
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:52.020]   his arm because he's jumping around the property because it's so much bigger or something.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.020]   Will you blame me?
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.020]   No, of course not.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:03.180]   Okay, because my fear is that one day you'll be like, "Well, you see, if we just stayed
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.620]   at our existing place, none of this would have happened."
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.940]   No, that's not how I am.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.660]   That's not how I am at all.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:16.420]   Especially in a decision this big, we're not going to move forward if we're not both 100%
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.420]   on board.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:22.460]   We are making this decision together, and we're not going backwards.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:27.300]   I am not going to ever ... I would never say something like that.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.300]   There's no way.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.300]   Okay.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.300]   Wow.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.300]   It's just human nature.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.300]   Heats of arguments.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.940]   You just never know the future.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:40.100]   For me, I've learned a lot, and I don't know if I've said this already on the podcast,
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:47.020]   or I said it in a post, but the reason why I'm comfortable moving every two to four years
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.740]   is because that's exactly what I did when I was growing up as a son of two Foreign Service
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.740]   officers.
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.660]   We moved around every two to four years.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:58.380]   And every single move, I was a little bit sad because I had to leave my friends, but
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:04.140]   I was also happy because I got to meet new friends, go to a new country, new food, new
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.820]   wonderful, wonderful experiences.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.820]   And I moved around.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:15.540]   I think it was six countries, Malaysia, Taiwan, Philippines, Zambia, America, Japan, and I
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:22.180]   thought it was a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful experience, full of excitement, full of adventure.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:28.180]   Whereas you, you have had a more stable living arrangement where you were in the same house
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:33.220]   from elementary school up until sophomore year in high school?
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.220]   Through college.
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:38.180]   Well, I wasn't living at home during college, but my home stayed the same.
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.180]   Okay.
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.180]   Yeah.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:46.700]   Yeah, so I think that is partially why you're more hesitant to move, and you probably have
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:53.380]   thought why I'm so unstable in terms of wanting to move so much.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.380]   You probably thought I was crazy for wanting to like, "Wait, you're looking for another
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.380]   house?
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.380]   We just got here."
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.500]   I don't think you're crazy.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:08.380]   I think, yes, we did grow up in different environments, different lifestyles.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:14.660]   However, as I said, we're moving forward with this decision together.
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:20.540]   We're not going to make a decision this big without being on the same page.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.540]   No.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:27.780]   Well, I think this was good therapy for me because I do have a lot of fears, and I think
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:32.260]   listeners can hear the fears and concerns that I have in my head.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:39.220]   If you're looking to upgrade homes, buy a home you really don't need, have these heart-to-heart
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:44.060]   conversations with your significant other because there will be good and bad things
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:49.140]   that will happen on your move and once you do move, and you want to make sure that you
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.740]   guys were on the same page and there was no miscommunication.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:26:02.660]   I think in a natural way, my trepidation now is to help protect me in the future of frankly
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.380]   you not being happy in the new home.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.380]   Oh, come on.
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:11.220]   I'm an easy person to please.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.260]   I'm very low maintenance.
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:17.220]   I am not the type to complain or say, "I want this.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.220]   I want that."
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.220]   That's not who I am.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.220]   You know that.
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:26.220]   It's more my fear of making you stressed and unhappy in those moments because life is full
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.500]   of ups and downs.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:35.220]   If we do move, I hope we can look back on this episode and you know that I had fear
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:40.840]   and I was thinking about you, about your stress levels and the potential for what could go
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:49.060]   wrong because every single time I do something big, when I move forward, I think, "Well,
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.340]   of course the positives are going to be greater than the negatives," but then the negatives
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:56.420]   always happen and sometimes I miss them.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.940]   When I miss them, then I feel guilty and I feel bad.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:08.580]   Hopefully, this conversation will make you realize that I'm doing my best and I have
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.540]   this fear and I'm trying to be as thorough as possible before we move forward.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:19.260]   Just on a practical note, for those who are looking to buy homes, I think, and I could
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:25.420]   be wrong, but now with rates so high, it's a very compelling time.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:32.140]   The competition is way down and rightly so because it's harder to afford a high mortgage
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.140]   rate.
[00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:38.820]   It's harder to come up with the funds and so it's less competition.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.460]   We have less competition, you have more bargaining power.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:51.260]   So anybody who's listing now, well, it could be a time to take advantage because I do fear
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:56.580]   that if mortgage rates come down by 1% to 2% in the future, that frenzy that I have
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.760]   experienced over the past 20 years, it ebbs and flows, will come back and if you identify
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:09.100]   that nice home during a frenzy market, chances of you actually winning without overpaying
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:13.740]   or winning a bidding war is very, very low.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.900]   So be prepared, folks.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.020]   Have deep discussions.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.380]   Get on the same page.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.620]   Run the numbers.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.940]   Look at my 30/30, 3-5 home buying rule.
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:29.380]   Look at my net worth and income rule for buying a home.
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.940]   These are really good guidelines to help you make one of the biggest decisions of your
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.180]   life.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:40.020]   I hope you enjoyed this little banter and you can use it to talk to your significant
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:46.140]   other about the gravity, the seriousness and the potential joy of buying a new home.
