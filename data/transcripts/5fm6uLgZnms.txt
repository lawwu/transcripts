[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020]   I'm not telling people what to do, and I'm not shaming anyone for doing anything.
[00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.700]   I'm just telling you what I have learned, okay?
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.360]   Our ancestors, we used to be breastfed for a minimum of three years.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.720]   And in some cultures, four years, five years, six years, right?
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.200]   When you are breastfeeding a kid, it pulls the face out, okay?
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.840]   They develop proper nasal breathing because they can't breathe if they're not breathing
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.840]   through their noses, right?
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.000]   And they're breastfeeding for a long time.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.120]   And they're doing this, how many times a day?
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.120]   Eight times a day when they're very young, 10 times a day.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.960]   This develops proper oral posture, nasal breathing from the get-go, helps pull the face open.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.680]   But it still makes a difference when you're older because when you chew, you help tone
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.240]   the airway.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.960]   And when you don't chew, that airway can get flabby, you know, can get out of shape just
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.560]   like any other part of your body, which makes it more apt to cause problems when you're
