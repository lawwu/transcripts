[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.120]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast and in this solo episode I
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.660]   want to talk about the minimum investment amount where work becomes optional.
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.000]   I started Financial Samurai in 2009 to make sense of the global financial crisis.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.800]   And that was the time where I really wanted to start leaving work, getting out and doing
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.480]   my own thing or just retiring early.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.640]   I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, but I knew I didn't want to work in finance
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.640]   anymore.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.620]   Ten years had passed and it was starting to feel like a big grind and it was no longer
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.620]   fun either.
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.240]   The correlation with performance and reward was going downhill because structurally the
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.160]   industry was in a decline, commission rates were coming down much like the real estate
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.640]   industry right now and it didn't feel good not to get rewarded based on merit anymore.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.840]   As a result I decided to save and invest as much as possible to one day break free and
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.580]   break free I did in 2012.
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.420]   But back then I didn't have a simple formula to help guide me into how much I needed to
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.960]   accumulate in my investments in order to feel comfortable to break free from work.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.720]   But now I have come up with a formula.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.800]   And this is also a formula based off of my 12 years of experience not having a day job.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.400]   I've gone through some ups and some downs, mostly ups because it's been a bull market,
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.560]   but of course I've gone through the market crash in March 2020 when COVID happened, the
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.100]   2022 bear market, and then the growth of my household expenses due to the growth of my
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.320]   family.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.120]   So it's been somewhat of a topsy-turvy ride, but in general it's been up and to the right
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.960]   again thanks to a strong economy and a strong market in the real estate market, stock market,
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.880]   and many other markets.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.320]   So if you are tired of work, you don't like your job, you want to retire early, take a
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.360]   sabbatical, maybe go back to school or take care of your young ones until they go to school
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.820]   full time, I have come up with the minimum investment threshold formula where work starts
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.040]   to become optional.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.000]   And that formula is taking the inverse of the historical return of the asset class you
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.520]   own and multiplying it by your gross annual income.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.500]   When you reach this minimum investment threshold, the annual return from your investments has
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.480]   a high chance of equaling or exceeding your annual gross salary.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.520]   Additionally, since long-term investment income and capital gains are generally taxed at a
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.880]   lower rate than your W-2 job income, you'll have an even larger after-tax cushion.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.800]   And once your investments can regularly match or exceed your annual gross income, you're
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.400]   more free to do what you want.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.260]   You don't have to work at a soul-sucking job anymore for big bucks or that healthcare.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.520]   You can take things down.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.440]   You can work at that job you've always wanted to work at, but that doesn't pay as well.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.760]   I think about high school college applicants all the time where they write about how they
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.280]   start non-profits and they try to save the world, basically to be a better human being
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.240]   and help one's brothers and sisters.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.680]   And then they go to college, they pay a lot of tuition, some get into a lot of debt, and
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.600]   then they see the typical industries, tech, consulting, finance, and they say, "You know
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   what?
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.960]   I'm going to join these industries even though I don't like them because I need to make as
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.080]   much money as possible."
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.840]   You see that over and over again if you have that opportunity to take it and then you forsake
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.000]   the things that you really like to do.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.040]   Well, once you achieve this investment threshold, you can actually go back to your roots to
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.280]   try to do what you really, really wanted to do in the first place, if it's not those high-paying
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.280]   industries.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.480]   And the beauty of my investment threshold formula is that it takes inflation into account
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.720]   because incomes are indexed towards inflation.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.520]   So whatever income you're making is calculated based on some inflation index and whatever
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.160]   raise you're going to get next year is based on some inflation index.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.320]   So every time you have an income change, hopefully a raise, you just recalculate the formula.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.480]   In turn, the investment returns are also helped by inflation and historically have greater
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.480]   returns than the rate of inflation.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.440]   So you don't have to calculate a real rate of return.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.680]   All you have to do is run the numbers again, especially every time you get a raise.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.640]   Other key assumptions for my investment threshold formula.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.720]   Well, I assume the financial freedom seeker lives within their means, doesn't carry expensive
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.240]   revolving credit card debt, and saves at least 20% of their after-tax income every year.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.000]   20% folks is the bare minimum, especially if you're listening to this personal finance
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.680]   podcast or reading Financial Samurai.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.960]   We've talked a lot about raising that saving rate to as high as possible.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.380]   If you can get to 50% saving rate, well, that means every year you work and save is one
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.200]   year of freedom you buy.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.680]   Another assumption is that the financial freedom seeker maintains their usual spending habits.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.200]   We're not talking about living on delicious ramen noodles and water to cut expenses to
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.960]   the minimum so you can achieve financial freedom sooner or lower that investment threshold
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   amount.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.280]   No, we're talking about living your normal life, living a good life, living a rich life,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.600]   not limiting yourself to living like a monk, shunning travel, renting a crappy studio apartment,
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.740]   or living on a boat or a van, avoiding having children, and forcing your partner and love
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.000]   of your life to work so that you can be free.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.480]   That's suboptimal.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.680]   Those are suboptimal decisions.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.720]   Of course, anybody can do it and if you enjoy that, then more power to you.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.260]   But I want you to live a comfortable life because I don't think there's a point to retiring
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.360]   early only to live near poverty and I also don't think it's ideal to live near poverty
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.000]   your entire career, your working career, just to retire early and continue to live in the
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   same way.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.200]   Instead, I think it would be much better to continue working or at least continue working
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.200]   in a job that you enjoy that might not pay as well.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.640]   Alright, so the investment threshold formula in action, again, it's taking the inverse
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.920]   of the historical return of the asset class you own and multiplying it by your gross annual
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920]   income.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.600]   So let's use three examples that I wrote in my post.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   First example, say you are 38 years old, you work in the government, you have high risk
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.200]   tolerance and you're comfortable with 100% allocation in stocks.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:59.720]   Well, we know that stocks historically have returned about 10% on average since 1926,
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.120]   therefore the inverse of 10% is 10.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:10.760]   So you just take 1 divided by 0.10 and that equals 10.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:18.120]   And then let's say your income is $100,000, so you take 10 times $100,000 equals $1,000,000.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.200]   So as a $100,000 a year income earner, once you have achieved $1,000,000 invested in the
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.440]   S&P 500, you should feel free to explore other options if you no longer enjoy your job.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:36.000]   So let's say you don't enjoy being a government worker with 2-3% raises and a lot of bureaucracy
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.040]   and you've always wanted to be an author or writer.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.960]   It doesn't pay very well, folks, I know, but you've wanted to pursue this dream since you
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.400]   were a child.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:51.960]   So you try your hand at writing and you earn $40,000 a year, which frankly is not that
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.960]   much money.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.960]   But guess what?
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   You can live off that.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:01.240]   You're happy because you're doing what you want and you have a $1.1 million stock portfolio
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.920]   after 15 years of working, saving, investing aggressively without fail.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:12.720]   So if you're able to survive off a $40,000 a year salary and not touch principal, you
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:19.960]   actually only need $400,000 invested in stocks using my investment threshold formula.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.760]   And since you decided to switch your career at 38 years old with $1.1 million in stocks,
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.560]   you actually have a $700,000 investment buffer.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.360]   So this is the example that I'm talking about where you can work at your higher paying job
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:39.260]   that you don't like, you gut it out for 10, 15, 20 years, but if you save and invest diligently,
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.280]   you can transition, you can quit the money and step away and do something you really
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.480]   enjoy that's going to nurture your soul instead of suck it dry.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.280]   Here's a second example of how you can use my income threshold formula to figure out
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.320]   when to retire.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.380]   Let's say you've worked for 23 years post-college and you're 45 years old.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:04.920]   You earn $300,000 a year in tech, a notoriously volatile industry.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.160]   So instead of being comfortable with 100% allocation of your retirement portfolio in
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.480]   stocks, you'd rather have a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.880]   When can you comfortably retire?
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:24.000]   Well, given that bonds historically have returned about 5%, the historical return of a 60/40
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.960]   portfolio is around 8%.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.000]   Now the inverse of 8% is 12.5.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   To find your investment threshold, multiply your gross annual income of $300,000 by 12.5
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.500]   which equals $3.75 million.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:50.120]   So if you have $3.75 million in a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio, that is when you can consider retiring
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.640]   early or doing something else.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.240]   Unfortunately in this example, you only have $2.5 million invested in stocks and bonds
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.360]   with no other assets for simplification purposes given this example.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.720]   Given that you can save $100,000 a year after taxes, a compound return calculator estimates
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:17.440]   your $2.5 million portfolio will reach over $3.75 million in about 3 years and 10 months,
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.360]   assuming an 8% annual return.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.160]   Of course, a bear market could extend your timeline and that's why you're dynamic.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.140]   You're going to change as the conditions change.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:34.720]   But overall, you feel great knowing that after using my investment threshold formula, you
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:42.160]   have a high probability of retiring in the next 5 years and no later than 6 or 7 years.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:49.560]   And once you have that target date in mind, I'm telling you folks, work becomes more bearable.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.720]   You don't have to fret about all those meetings and the performance as much.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.980]   You see the light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:01.680]   And when you see that light, you just get motivated to keep on going, to break free.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.240]   Alright, here's the final example of how using my income threshold formula can help you decide
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.360]   to take it down a notch at work or do something different.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.040]   Let's say you're 26 years old and an associate in investment banking.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:21.280]   You're already kind of burned out, kind of hate your lifestyle, but you're making $200,000
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.640]   a year, which is great money for a 26-year-old.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.040]   And let's say you also grew up in a culture that values real estate more than stocks.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.120]   Real estate is a tangible asset.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.600]   It doesn't just go poof overnight like stocks.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.920]   Real estate provides shelter, generates income, and is less volatile in general than stocks.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:46.200]   So, you invest all your money outside of banking into residential real estate for retirement.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.600]   Bonds, simply a little too boring.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.880]   Real estate is like bonds plus, right?
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.640]   Higher upside and similar amount of downside.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.520]   Not the same, but similar.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.480]   When the economy is going down, rates are going down, demand for real estate tends to
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.040]   get betrayed because affordability increases.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:10.680]   Now, historically, real estate has returned about 4% on average, 2% above the long-term
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.680]   inflation rate.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.120]   When inflation is up, real estate returns tend to go higher as well, as we saw in 2020,
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.120]   2021.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.840]   Now, interestingly, I have looked around the internet, research papers, and some publications
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.280]   such as the San Francisco Fed suggest that real estate has historically returned 7% annually
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.640]   since 1850s.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:37.240]   So, real estate is local, but overall, let's say 4% annual rate of return for the country.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:42.400]   To figure out how much real estate you need in order to make work optional, you do the
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.920]   same formula.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.440]   You take the inverse of the historical rate of return and multiply it by your gross annual
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.440]   income.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:56.840]   So, in this case, the inverse of 4% is 25, and you multiply 25 by 200,000, your gross
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.520]   annual income, to get $5,000,000.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.740]   Now you must do your best to live off of $200,000 or less as your income grows and save and
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:10.240]   invest as much as possible on any income above $200,000.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.760]   $5,000,000 in real estate sounds like a lot, and it is a lot.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.320]   But in our system today, people with good credit and stable income are able to acquire
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.640]   real estate using a 20% down payment.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:28.040]   So, you really only need $1,000,000 to buy $5,000,000 worth of real estate over time.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.880]   I'm not talking immediately, I'm talking about over time where you're building your residential
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.140]   real estate portfolio.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:39.280]   Now, $1,000,000 down payment is $1,000,000 less or 50% less than you would need if you
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.640]   preferred to have 100% of your portfolio in the S&P 500.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.720]   Because if you were making $200,000 and you preferred 100% in stocks, you would take the
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.720]   inverse of 10%, which is the historical rate of return for stocks, and you'd get 10, and
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.240]   10 times 200,000 is $2,000,000.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:03.840]   So, with real estate, you only need $1,000,000 in down payment to command $5,000,000 in value.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.440]   Now, of course, if you own residential real estate and are a landlord, you're going to
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.840]   have to spend time and money managing your properties and tenants.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.600]   Additionally, with significant debt, your real estate equity could fluctuate much more
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   dramatically.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.240]   But the thing is, you're 26 years old, so in your 20s and 30s, you have a lot more energy
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:29.800]   and time and desire to make more money, so you are comfortable managing people and trying
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.720]   to gain sweat equity by remodeling and expanding your property.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.720]   The key is to own rental properties that generate strong cash flow, which you can live off of.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:46.400]   And fortunately, as we read in a previous post, rental property income yields are higher
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.720]   than stock dividend yields in general.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.360]   And also, the power of rental property income is greater because to generate that rental
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:59.600]   property income doesn't require the same amount of degradation in the asset as stocks.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.640]   When you're paying a dividend from the company's balance sheet, let's say it's a $100 dividend,
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.200]   your balance sheet, the cash balance goes down by exactly $100 as well.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.940]   It's not free money dividends.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:16.240]   But when your rental property generates $100 in income, it's not like $100 worth of damage
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.040]   and property taxes and so forth occurs.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:25.000]   I hope these three examples help elucidate how you can use my investment minimum threshold
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.080]   to make work optional.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:32.200]   The key here is to actually make a change, to have a courage to change your life for
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   the better.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.000]   I know quitting the money is hard, it can be scary, but if you've reached that investment
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.560]   threshold and you're not happy with your life, you have to make that change because when
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.400]   you get older and look back on your life, you're going to feel regret.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:54.120]   And as I've learned and experienced over time, regret really starts eating you up inside
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.720]   and it actually grows.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.800]   But the good thing about this uncomfortable feeling of regret is that it propels you to
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:05.320]   make a change right now and propels you to think more analytically and take more risks
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.480]   so you don't have as many future regrets.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   I want to make it clear that my investment threshold formula represents the minimum amount
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.740]   you need before feeling comfortable transitioning out of your current job.
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.320]   It's the practical and responsible minimum amount you need to change your life.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.160]   Obviously, you can change your life much sooner than before you hit the minimum investment
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.760]   threshold, but it's a little bit more risky.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:36.360]   Also, once you achieve this minimum investment threshold, it's unlikely you're going to be
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.780]   able to or feel confident enough to retire early.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.520]   And that's not the point of this threshold.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:47.600]   This threshold is to help you figure out when is that time where you can start taking it
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.800]   down a notch, but not fully take it down a notch.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.760]   After all, if there's a 70+% chance of your investments making money any given year, there's
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.240]   a 30% chance of your investments losing money in any given year.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.960]   Therefore, you're likely to aim to accumulate more investments or continue working even
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.760]   after reaching this investment threshold.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.200]   It's very logical and I've gone through this experience since 2012.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.700]   So let's say you expect a bear market to happen and your investments to decline by 30% one
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.700]   year.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:23.800]   Well, to give yourself a buffer, aim to achieve 142% of the minimum investment threshold amount
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.620]   that comes out from the calculation.
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.680]   That way, you have a 30% downside buffer.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.160]   And let's say you think there's going to be back-to-back years of 30% declines, which
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:41.480]   is extremely rare, then mathematically speaking, you just need to accumulate 204% of the minimum
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.800]   investment threshold and then you're protected.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:50.040]   Pretty cool how there's a simple mathematical calculation for anything.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:55.480]   The hard part, the trick is figuring out how much is enough that corresponds with your
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.880]   risk tolerance, your hopes, your dreams, and your goals.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:04.440]   I really want everyone to take action once you achieve this investment threshold.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.060]   Not only calculate it, but be methodical and then take action to change your life for the
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.920]   better once this threshold is reached.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.920]   This means not wasting another minute at a job you dislike, hopefully you negotiate a
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.480]   severance package.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.660]   This means leaving a terrible relationship behind because you're no longer financially
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.520]   dependent on someone, but you're independent and you can do whatever you want.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.620]   Changing your life for the better also means doing the things you've always been afraid
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.680]   to do because money has held you back.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.000]   Finally, I suggest everyone stay dynamic.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.320]   Stay on their toes and calculate this formula every single year.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.980]   And just do a gut check to see where you are progressing, how far you have to go, what's
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.700]   the latest income figure you have, and whether this is enough to make you happy and live
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.560]   the life that you want.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.880]   Because life is always changing, always.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:01.080]   On your financial journey, you're undoubtedly going to experience fear and doubt as economic
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.560]   and personal circumstances evolve.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:09.720]   The key is to remain flexible with your financial goals and adapt to the changing conditions.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:15.800]   For example, when my wife left her corporate job at age 35 in 2015, I thought we'd be
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.640]   very happy, very comfortable living on $10,000 a month, right?
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.440]   Sounds pretty good in less expensive Honolulu, Hawaii.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.160]   Based on my conservative investment return target of 2-3 times the 10-year treasury bond
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:34.520]   yield, retiring early with $3-4 million invested seemed like enough.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.400]   But the problem is this was a static number and it was just a number.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.640]   I hadn't lived this.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.640]   I was just imagining this.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:48.480]   Then in 2017, our son was born, followed by our daughter in December 2019.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.020]   And then a year later, the pandemic hit, prompting the government to inject trillions of dollars
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.520]   into the economy, which fueled inflation for two years.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.800]   It's kind of unpredictable, scary times.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.520]   So relatively quickly, the $120,000 was no longer enough to raise two kids in San Francisco.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:12.720]   It's funny because to qualify for affordable housing in San Francisco, you have to make
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.800]   around $120,000 or less.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:20.400]   So now, in order to live the lifestyle that we want, which I think is a relatively middle-class
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:28.440]   lifestyle, a house, a car, 2-3 weeks of vacation a year, requires about $300,000 to $350,000
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.320]   a year in annual household income.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.760]   And I know some of you folks living in lower cost areas of the country or the world will
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.040]   think that's ridiculous, but those are the numbers.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:45.560]   And so using a 5% rate of return on our investments, that means needing at least $7 million invested
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.800]   where work becomes optional.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:53.760]   And even if work isn't optional for some reason, for those of you just wondering when, how
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.760]   much money will I have where I will finally feel settled and comfortable and financially
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.760]   free?
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.160]   Well, based on this example and calculation, that number is $7 million.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   Now it's not all going to be the same for everyone, but using my investment threshold
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:15.000]   formula gives you an idea of when you can feel that mental reprieve where you don't
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.040]   have to grind forever, for so long and so hard anymore.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   So there you have it folks.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.240]   I hope you use my investment threshold formula to your advantage.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:31.800]   Back in 2009 and 2010, I didn't have this formula, this clear guide to help me shoot
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.520]   for what to save and invest in and how much.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.960]   And so now we do.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:42.720]   And I've gone through the past 12 years without full-time employment and therefore I really
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:48.040]   believe this investment threshold formula will help you achieve the life that you want
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.920]   in a responsible manner.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:50.920]   Thanks so much everyone.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.720]   If you enjoyed this podcast, I'd love a share and a positive review.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.320]   It keeps me going.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.640]   And also please share this idea, this concept of the investment threshold formula to as
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.920]   many people as possible and run your own numbers.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.600]   I haven't seen this type of formula anywhere, but it's clear and it's actionable and
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.020]   it's something that I love to come up with to help you achieve financial freedom sooner
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.020]   rather than later.
