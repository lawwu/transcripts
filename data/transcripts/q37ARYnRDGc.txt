[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Guest Series,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.120]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.320]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.600]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.360]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.920]   Today's episode marks the sixth and final
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.120]   of the six episode series
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.200]   on fitness, exercise, and performance.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.780]   And today's discussion is all about nutrition
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.520]   and supplementation to maximize your fitness,
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.440]   exercise, and performance goals.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.200]   Dr. Andy Yalpin.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.680]   - I'm super excited to discuss today's topic,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.180]   which is nutrition and supplementation
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.920]   for performance and recovery.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.560]   And I'm particularly excited about this conversation
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.360]   because I've been interested in supplementation
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.040]   and nutrition for performance really since my teens,
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.800]   but also because in recent years,
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.120]   we've witnessed a massive transformation
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.040]   in the general public in terms of their view
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.700]   of supplementation and nutrition.
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.480]   First of all, more people are thinking about nutrition.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.320]   What is good nutrition?
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.240]   What is not a very barbed wire topic, as you know,
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.580]   but there are some truths in there that we'll discuss,
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.240]   but also supplementation.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.680]   You know, whereas 10, 15 years ago,
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.160]   I think most people would either be really into supplements.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.740]   That was a small percentage of people,
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.700]   but the majority of people were either told
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.440]   or were thinking, oh, you know, vitamins,
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.820]   you mostly excrete them.
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.360]   They're just expensive urine.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.660]   Nowadays, it seems that many people,
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.640]   including many of my colleagues and physicians
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.020]   all the way down to sports performance experts,
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.240]   are taking and making recommendations
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.120]   about certain supplements.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.960]   And so the way that I like to think about supplements
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.200]   is that they aren't necessarily just supplements,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.160]   which makes it sound like they are augmenting
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.440]   what should already be there,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.260]   but you're not quite getting enough of.
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.720]   But indeed, a lot of these things we call supplements
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.440]   are very potent compounds that can transform our ability
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.720]   to perform in the short term, to recover from exercise,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.960]   and that can really shape brain chemistry,
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.480]   hormone patterns acutely and when taken long-term.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.160]   So I'm very excited about today's topic
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.100]   and to be able to try and sort through this,
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.500]   let's call it a cloud, hopefully not a storm,
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.520]   but this cloud of supplements that are out there,
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.920]   because indeed, many of them are excellent
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.840]   and can provide us a lot.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.900]   Some of them are terrible,
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.360]   and then some just don't do anything,
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.160]   and therefore are terrible
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.320]   because either they have side effects
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.920]   or because they're very expensive
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920]   and they don't do anything.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.880]   And then of course, within the realm of nutrition,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.020]   there's an equal amount of confusion,
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.480]   but that's why I'm talking to you,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.880]   because you're gonna put clarity and structure and definition
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.520]   on these incredibly important topics.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.120]   - You absolutely nailed it there.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.520]   One of the major reasons supplements can work
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.320]   is because you can consume nutrients
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.920]   in extremely high concentrations,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.680]   such that you would not get in nature through food.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.040]   Having said that, you really do wanna focus
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.200]   on the basic sleep, nutrition, hydration,
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.080]   and I'm going to get into very specific detail later
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.440]   with some of those things.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.980]   That said, there are plenty of situations and circumstances
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.540]   when supplementation can do exactly what you said.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.120]   Also though, because you are taking them
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.180]   in such high concentrations,
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.960]   they can also be unproductive, they can be destructive,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.940]   or they can be counterproductive.
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.180]   So in case if you're taking a couple of supplements
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.280]   over here, it may actually be counteracting the benefits
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.240]   of some of the other supplements over there.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.500]   So in the ideal situation,
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.820]   we would be able to work like snipers here.
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.480]   So we would be able to run full biological testing.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.520]   So extensive blood work and saliva and urine and stool
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.360]   and have an in-depth analysis of your gut microbiome
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.900]   and your stress patterns and your time of day
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.980]   and your cortisol curve and like all the things
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.760]   that we do in our high performance folks.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.540]   With that then, we can get extremely high precision
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.960]   supplementation and quite honestly, our philosophy is
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.080]   we only give individuals exactly what they need.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.600]   So even some of the standard, generally safe
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.040]   and effective supplements, we don't really necessarily
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.240]   use them if there's no specific need.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.960]   And we've talked about the consequences of this
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.160]   with things like antioxidants, but even simple stuff
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.560]   like stimulants and other tools that are effective
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.080]   for recovery, we don't use them unless we have a reason.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.400]   That said, that's not the reality for a lot of people.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.440]   They're not going to be able to do something like that
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.460]   or work with somebody who can help them in that.
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.600]   So there are a handful of supplements that I would consider
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.880]   to be in my 80/20 rule, which is sort of like the 20%
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.120]   of supplements that are going to give you 80% of the benefit
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.320]   for the lowest cost.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.240]   And so what I can actually use to sort of start there,
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.860]   even though this burns my skin and my soul a little bit,
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.980]   I absolutely hate this.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.420]   I am the context guy, I'm the, it depends.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.120]   It's high precision guy, but let's be real.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.080]   There are a number of supplements that are fairly effective
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.480]   and fairly cheap for a wide range of outcomes.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.400]   So this is for general public.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.960]   This is for people who want to do the three buckets, right?
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.800]   You want to look a certain way.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.320]   So supplements that could enhance muscle growth
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   and fat loss, non-hormonal based supplements, of course.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.880]   Supplements that can improve energy or physical performance.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.520]   Again, from everything from squatting more
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.900]   to feeling better in your yoga class
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.560]   to having more energy throughout the day
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.120]   to our third major bucket that we've been talking about
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.280]   throughout this entire series, which are longevity.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.040]   So we can cover those first if you'd like to start there.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.000]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.020]   Let's start there.
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.640]   - Oftentimes when we think of supplements,
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.640]   we immediately jump to high sport performance
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.460]   type of things or vigorous workouts or muscle building.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.400]   Though that doesn't necessarily have to be the case.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.840]   Take for example, creatine.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.200]   And I've spoken about this at length
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.980]   and with Darren Kandao,
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.600]   who's done a tremendous amount of research.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.000]   I was just up at his lab recently in Canada
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.760]   and he has covered extensively.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.300]   In fact, I think I put up a post,
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.140]   perhaps I could draw this up,
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.920]   where he laid out all the myriad of benefits of creatine.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.640]   This is taken in the typically three to five grams
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.640]   per day of dose of creatine monohydrate,
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.540]   which has the most research behind it.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.900]   Seems to be extremely low side effects in almost anyone.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.760]   And the benefits include in course,
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.920]   things like muscle performance and strength
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.760]   and things like that.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.800]   And if you go back to our discussion
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.000]   and our episode on metabolism and endurance,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.800]   we talked about the phosphocreatine system.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   So you can figure out kind of what this is going to do
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.180]   in terms of effect.
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.560]   That said, there's excellent information
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.300]   and data coming out now on the benefits
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.240]   of bone mineral density in creatine.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.780]   There's a ton of work looking at a host of cognitive factors
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.760]   from memory, executive function,
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.680]   to effects potentially on even things like depression,
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.140]   mood, to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.480]   all forms of neurodegenerative disease.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.200]   In fact, it's pretty obvious.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.120]   The brain loves creatine as a fuel.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.180]   And so not only, we sort of discussed it in the episode
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.260]   as being the fuel for skeletal muscle contraction,
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.520]   but the brain needs to do that as well.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.660]   The astrocytes around the brain
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.960]   need to be able to provide energy, et cetera.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.400]   So it's very clear that metabolism in the brain
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.960]   is reduced with things like TBI and potentially concussions.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.400]   So now to be extremely clear,
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.580]   creatine does not prevent any of those diseases.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.020]   It does not treat any of them and the data are mixed,
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.060]   but more and more are coming.
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.240]   Some show a little bit of benefit,
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.900]   some show maybe none,
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.480]   but I'm not aware of any research in those areas
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.920]   that show it has any downside.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.280]   For the most part, side effects are extremely minimal
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.440]   if not null, and then potentially some benefit
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.600]   depending on the specific study.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.540]   So we could put up, if you'd like,
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.520]   a couple of links directly to those meta-analyses
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.580]   and folks can go through those things one by one.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.680]   So I only say that to, again,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.640]   maybe expand our understanding or thinking
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.200]   about what these types of supplements can do.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.000]   It's not just about growing muscle or high performance.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.360]   It's everything to, again,
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.580]   there's an association with recovery.
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.600]   So creatine is fantastic for recovery from muscle,
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.080]   for muscle damage,
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.960]   helps and can potentially aid in fat loss
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.140]   and a whole host of things.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:59.040]   So you can actually also even look at websites
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.180]   like examine.com.
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.960]   I have no affiliation with them whatsoever,
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.580]   but if you want to just type in something
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.200]   like creatine monohydrate,
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.280]   you can see a whole list
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.060]   and you're going to see thousands of studies
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.920]   of the potential benefits of creatine.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.400]   So that is always number one on my list.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.760]   - I'm relieved to hear that creatine sits at the top
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.480]   of your supplementation list because,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.760]   well, first of all, I started taking it
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.580]   when I was in college.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.720]   At that time, I was taking it in this kind of loading mode
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.720]   where you take it in anywhere from 15 to 25 grams per day,
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.780]   often causing some gastric distress,
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.320]   often combining with fruit juice
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.180]   to try and shuttle it into the muscles.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.080]   And then so-called maintenance phase
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.640]   of reducing to 10 or 15 grams per day.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.000]   Nowadays, I just take about five grams or so,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.780]   although later I know you're going to tell me
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.360]   why I should probably be taking more
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.760]   than five grams per day given my body weight.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.340]   So I know we'll get into some of those specifics
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.280]   a little bit later.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.600]   But in addition to experiencing direct effects
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.960]   on muscle size and strength, which I did,
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.880]   I don't know how it contributed to my cognitive function
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.440]   or if it does now because there's really no way
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.440]   to tease that out with standard at-home tests like a scale.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.520]   But it is very clear to me based on the literature
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.940]   that you described and some of which we've covered
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.560]   on other episodes of the podcast
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.160]   that the phosphocreatine system is vitally important
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.520]   for forebrain function, right, the forebrain of course
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.280]   being the portion of brain, broadly speaking,
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.140]   the portion of brain just behind your forehead
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.440]   that is responsible for planning, action,
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.920]   setting rules and context.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.900]   So even as simple as if you're going downfield
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.160]   in a game of soccer or basketball and you're on offense,
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.080]   and then you make an attempt on goal or basket,
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.580]   and then it switches and you go back.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.900]   Now you're on defense.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.320]   Being on defense is very different than being on offense.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.420]   And that goal, excuse me, that rule switching
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.000]   is a prefrontal cortical function
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.920]   as is every context dependent way of thinking or acting.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.180]   And so anything that can favor function of the forebrain
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.680]   I think is good for humans in general.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.720]   It suppresses anxiety,
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.920]   allows us to interpret what's going on for us.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.140]   And so I'm very relieved and gratified to hear
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.000]   that creatine sits at the top of the list.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.740]   Also, as I'm sure you'll point out again later,
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.640]   creatine is for the most part
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.280]   a relatively affordable supplement for most people.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.540]   So here we're not talking about something
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.560]   that's really esoteric or that you have to, you know,
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.080]   fly to some remote location to get an infusion of.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.900]   - Right.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.740]   Although I apologize to all you
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.820]   'cause I know the price has skyrocketed recently.
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.660]   - Really?
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.480]   - Yeah.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.320]   - Why is that?
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.160]   - Well, nobody knows,
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.060]   but it's quote unquote a supply and demand issue,
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:37.900]   if you will.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.200]   So those prices have gone up.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.040]   There's also, of course,
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.520]   been shipping problems in the world and things.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.800]   So every time I talk about creatine right now,
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.080]   people just flame me for like,
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.320]   "Oh my God, it's so expensive now."
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.200]   I'm like, "I know, I'm sorry."
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.480]   But honestly, it's only so expensive
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.780]   because you're used to being so cheap.
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.480]   So when you counter the fact that you're like,
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.320]   yeah, like relative to the other stuff
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.240]   you're probably taking,
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.560]   relative to any other number of purchases for the,
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.560]   it still lands very high in my ROI list,
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.720]   my, you know, my 80/20,
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.540]   because of that, it can be taken any time of the day.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.600]   It doesn't have to be in magical combination.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   You talked about co-ingesting with carbohydrates.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.360]   That can enhance how quickly it can get into the system.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.840]   In fact, it's gonna work on the exact same mechanisms
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.700]   we'll probably potentially talk about in hydration.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.800]   But these things are shuttled.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.320]   So anytime you're bringing in carbohydrate,
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.960]   that's going to be shipped into tissue as quickly as it can.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.480]   Creatine then goes along for the ride
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.560]   and then it brings water for the ride.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.760]   That's how you enhance hydration.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.520]   That's why it's important to have carbohydrates
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.400]   when you're trying to hydrate.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.320]   So you're just gonna take it in there.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   And that's also why you get quote unquote cell swelling,
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.840]   which is a good thing.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.180]   It's just enhancing hydration.
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.040]   We actually use it a ton in our post weigh-in protocols.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.520]   So individuals that have to cut water weight.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.900]   Creatine's a great thing to throw back in there.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.000]   It's gonna help you rehydrate.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.500]   It's also why when you take 30 grams of it,
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.500]   it can pull a bunch of fluid in the intestines
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.940]   and there you go with your little bit of GI distress.
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.200]   So yeah, there's a lot of fun things
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.320]   you can talk about there.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.160]   I just had to flag that
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.960]   because every time I've been talking about it recently
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.080]   and I say it's cheap, people are killing me for it.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.680]   So I apologize.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.840]   I don't know how to make it any cheaper,
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.280]   but it's still fairly affordable.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.180]   - Yeah, I would say relatively inexpensive
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.780]   compared to a lot of supplements out there.
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.560]   And when thinking about the return on investment,
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.600]   it's quite good.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.480]   - Yeah, so like actually, sorry to cut you off,
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.420]   but I was just also thinking,
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.800]   there's been a number of studies on sleep deprivation
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.560]   as well with creatine that can help.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.740]   So obviously sleep deprivation
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.680]   will generally reduce cognitive function
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.920]   and creatine can ameliorate some of that drop.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.480]   So if you think about it in that context,
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.480]   I had a crummy night of sleep.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.440]   Well, and if that enables you to perform
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.420]   a little bit better in your job,
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.640]   then you would make up the dollar or so,
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.100]   whatever you paid for that day's supply of creatine.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.140]   So it is something, kind of on that note,
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.180]   it's not going to work as an acute response.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.780]   So it's not something you're like, I feel terrible,
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.620]   let me throw some creatine down the hatch, I'll feel better.
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.540]   That's not gonna work.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.500]   It's going to take several weeks to have a noticeable effect.
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.620]   It needs to be stored in tissue.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.460]   It needs to be built up
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.080]   before you can actually do much of anything.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.820]   So it is unlike some of the other things like stimulants
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.740]   or caffeine that have an acute response right now.
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.180]   And so if you're going to take it,
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.980]   you probably need to consume it consistently.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.820]   If you can't do that,
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.880]   then really there's no point in doing it.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.620]   And the loading phase, you mentioned distance war here,
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.480]   is something you can do, again,
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.200]   if you need to enhance the storage of it really quickly.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.760]   So say, for example, we've done this in some military cases
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.000]   where it's like you get back to base
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.940]   and you've only got a week and then you got to go back out.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.840]   We may actually have to do
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.320]   a little bit of a loading phase then.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.720]   But if that's not the case, the loading phase is unnecessary.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.040]   It's not really harmful other than maybe GI stress
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.620]   and maybe waste.
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.160]   But you're going to have three or four weeks,
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.760]   it's going to reach full saturation,
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.240]   plenty of time to be there in that,
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.680]   if you're in that three to seven grams per day range.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.680]   - Well, I'm glad you mentioned
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.780]   the slow accumulating positive effects of creatine
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.580]   as compared to so-called acute effects.
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.260]   Because the way that I think of
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.640]   health promoting and performance enhancing protocols
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.720]   like viewing morning sunlight
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.040]   or endurance exercise for that matter,
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.180]   or creatine or sleep, for instance,
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.120]   is that while they can have effects in the immediate term,
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.360]   you might feel a little bit,
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.860]   or in the case of a good night's sleep, a lot better.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.560]   It's really the cumulative effect
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.240]   of raising your baseline level of functioning.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.860]   You know, there's another way to think about it is
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.560]   these supplements or behaviors and quality nutrition
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.440]   when done consistently over time,
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.080]   and that doesn't mean 100% of the time,
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.680]   but you know, probably 80% of the time,
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.440]   lead to a sort of buoyancy in your system
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.460]   that allows you to be more resilient
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.100]   under conditions where conditions aren't perfect, right?
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.080]   And if conditions are made perfect or close to perfect
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.460]   and you already have that buoyancy,
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.760]   that's when you really start to see
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.920]   the ultra high performance effects that are so much fun,
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.640]   but they have to be established
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.820]   through consistent supplementation,
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.060]   consistent nutritional intake.
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.900]   So today I know we're going to distinguish between,
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.940]   normally they're called chronic and acute effects,
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.660]   but that makes it sound like chronic illness.
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.720]   The moment people hear chronic,
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.800]   well, they might think of other things,
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.260]   but in the context of health,
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260]   they typically think of, you know, chronic illness,
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.100]   and we're not talking about that.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.000]   What we're talking about
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.840]   is slow modulatory effects in the body.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.160]   A lot of things in the body take time to build up,
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.680]   but once they've built up, they clearly can benefit us.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.440]   And then other things, as you mentioned,
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.480]   you know, a stimulant, for instance,
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.680]   has a very acute effect that is going to occur with,
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.100]   you know, peak within 30 minutes
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.420]   and wear off within, you know, four hours or so,
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.080]   can also have some chronic effects,
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.240]   but typically it's a short-lived effect.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.000]   So we just want to frame up the language that we'll be using,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.560]   and I'm really excited to dive into this topic.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.560]   I think creatine is a beautiful example of a supplement
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.560]   that has positive chronic mental and physical benefits.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.080]   - Down the road, I can come back
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.760]   and talk a little bit more about creatine,
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   and we can cover some other information
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.420]   regarding best practices for getting the most out of it,
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.080]   as well as we'll certainly dive into
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.680]   some of the common side effects,
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.800]   or at least a thought of side effects.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.080]   While we're here, though, I also could throw in a few other
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.880]   of these high-impact, low-cost, generally safe,
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.800]   things that are my 80/20 rule, if you will.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.960]   So the way I actually kind of think about it is
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.320]   you want one from each of three categories.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.680]   And these categories are fuel,
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.400]   stimulant, and fatigue blockers.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.760]   So creatine is actually in the fuel.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.840]   It's not a stimulant.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.080]   We talked about the chronic effect there.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.760]   So we've already knocked that one off.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.960]   Another one from the fatigue blocker
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.600]   is going to be anything like beta-alanine
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.240]   or sodium bicarbonate.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.680]   And then from the stimulant use,
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.360]   of course, we have anything like a beetroot juice
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.720]   to a caffeine or something of the equivalent.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.080]   So we can come back again and talk about all those
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.100]   in more detail a little bit later.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.640]   - Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.280]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.200]   It is also separate from Dr. Andy Galpin's
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.640]   teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.520]   It is, however, part of our desire and effort
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.020]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.640]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.840]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.440]   we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.460]   Our first sponsor is Momentus.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.780]   Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.060]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to be partnering
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.360]   with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.520]   First of all, as I mentioned,
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.440]   their supplements are of extremely high quality.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.200]   Second of all, their supplements are generally
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.240]   in single ingredient formulations.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.660]   If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol,
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.120]   you're going to want to focus mainly
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.220]   on using single ingredient formulations.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.000]   With single ingredient formulations,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.300]   you can devise the most logical and effective
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.760]   and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.080]   In addition, Momentus supplements ship internationally.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.040]   And this is, of course, important because we realized
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.080]   that many of the Huberman Lab Podcast listeners
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.040]   reside outside the United States.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.600]   If you'd like to try the various supplements
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.440]   mentioned on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.840]   in particular supplements for hormone health,
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.960]   for sleep optimization, for focus,
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.140]   as well as a number of other things,
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.800]   including exercise recovery,
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.920]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.480]   so that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.040]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.440]   Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.140]   and activities affect your health
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.840]   by giving you real-time feedback on your blood glucose
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.880]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.040]   Many people are aware that their blood sugar,
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.760]   that is their blood glucose level,
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.120]   is critical for everything from fat loss, to muscle gain,
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.440]   to healthy cognition, and indeed, aging of the brain
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.460]   and body.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.340]   Most people do not know, however, how different foods
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.040]   and different activities, including exercise
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.840]   or different temperature and environments,
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.360]   impact their blood glucose levels,
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.800]   and yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.320]   to all of those things.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.180]   I first started using Levels about a year ago
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.060]   as a way to understand how different foods,
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.040]   exercise, and timing of food relative to exercise
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.300]   and quality of sleep at night impact my blood glucose levels
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.660]   and I've learned a tremendous amount from using Levels.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.780]   It's taught me when best to eat, what best to eat,
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.660]   when best to exercise, how best to exercise,
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.380]   and how to modulate my entire schedule
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.340]   from work to exercise and even my sleep.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.100]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.720]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.940]   go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.520]   That's levels.link/huberman.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.880]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.780]   Element is an electrolyte drink that contains
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.460]   the exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium, magnesium,
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.020]   and potassium to optimize cellular functioning
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.780]   for mental and physical performance.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.740]   Most people realize that hydration is key.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.860]   We need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.120]   and perform our best, but what most people do not realize
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.380]   is that the proper functioning of our cells
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.500]   and nerve cells, neurons in particular,
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.980]   requires that sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.360]   be present in the correct ratios.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.500]   Now, of course, people with prehypertension and hypertension
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.640]   need to be careful about their sodium intake,
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.400]   but what a lot of people don't realize
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.260]   is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise,
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.840]   and in particular, if you're following a very clean diet,
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.800]   that is not a lot of processed foods,
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.900]   which of course is a good thing,
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.780]   chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium,
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.540]   and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance.
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.260]   Element contains a science-backed ratio of 1000 milligrams,
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.180]   that's one gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium,
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.300]   and 60 milligrams of magnesium and no sugar.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.700]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.940]   that's lmnt.com/huberman to get a free Element sample pack
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.780]   with your purchase.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.380]   Again, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com/huberman
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.840]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.920]   To start off, I want to ask you about something
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.480]   that as soon as I say it, some people might roll their eyes
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.080]   or wonder why are we even talking about that now,
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.280]   but that I have to believe is among the more fundamental,
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:51.200]   if not foundational aspects of nutrition and supplementation
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.220]   for performance, and that's hydration, right?
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.040]   I mean, I think we hear hydration, it's like okay,
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.300]   we have to drink six to eight glasses of water every day,
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.140]   our urine should be relatively clear,
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.160]   if it's too dark yellow, we're not doing a good job
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.100]   of hydrating enough.
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.500]   How much of that is true?
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.040]   Is alkaline water worthwhile for changing the alkalinity
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:12.880]   of my body?
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.020]   I learned when I was in college and graduate school
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.260]   that the alkalinity of the different tissues in your body
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.680]   is very well controlled in order to keep you alive,
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.740]   and that you don't want it to shift too much
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.940]   or you can enter pretty horrible states of seizure,
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.640]   vomiting, and even death.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.080]   So tell me about hydration and woven into that,
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.200]   if you would, educate me on electrolytes and hydration,
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.900]   because I think most often when people ingest electrolytes,
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.240]   sure, they could be ingesting salt tablets,
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.160]   probably getting some electrolytes, by the way,
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.500]   electrolyte, sodium, magnesium, potassium
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.460]   through their food, I think most people think
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.420]   about drinking electrolytes.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.140]   So water and electrolytes, I think,
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.140]   is a vitally important topic to kick this off with.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.900]   - Sure, we can jump right into your alkaline water.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.920]   While there's perhaps much to say about this,
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.440]   we can maybe revisit this in another seven part series
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.820]   all on its own, I would just say it this way,
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.060]   there's probably a few things you should do
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.400]   before worrying about the alkalinity of your water,
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.500]   and I'll just leave it at that.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.020]   - Meaning the alkalinity of the water is sort of irrelevant?
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.540]   - Not that, you won't go that far, it's just,
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.780]   it's probably, remember we sort of started off
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.940]   talking about 80/20?
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.300]   Well this would be in my like 99/1,
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.900]   in terms of like, if we're really at the level
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.700]   of worrying about the pH of your drinking fluid,
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.980]   we have optimized so many other things,
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.080]   that then we can talk about it.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.520]   But until we have nailed months and years of work
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.400]   on other things, this is just not gonna make
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.740]   much of an impact.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.860]   - Great, then perhaps you could tell us about
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.300]   what volume of water we should be drinking,
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.760]   when we should be drinking that water
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.060]   relative to training, and just generally.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.660]   And anything else related to water and electrolytes
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.220]   that can improve mental performance, physical performance,
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.300]   and offset any ill effects.
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.660]   - I like the fact that you mentioned
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.120]   physical and mental performance,
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.860]   because it's clear in both cases.
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.260]   We hear that we need to drink more water,
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.580]   and I can give you some numbers, and I will in a second.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.660]   What we also need to recognize is there's,
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.500]   this is hormesis.
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.140]   We talked about hormesis a few episodes ago.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.900]   And this is the case, right?
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.740]   Whether we talked about food, or hydration,
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.940]   or I think I gave you the example of cyanide,
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.860]   naturally occurring in your food.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:28.940]   Hot water is the same way.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.540]   So if you are under hydrated or dehydrated,
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.500]   then there is a clear negative effect on your body.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.780]   And as I increase the level,
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.900]   or improve the level of hydration, things get better.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.360]   Whether this is your physical performance,
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.500]   or whether this is mental performance.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.980]   In fact, we know that a body weight reduction
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.020]   of as low as 2% via dehydration.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.780]   So imagine you're doing a bout of exercise,
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.860]   and you're sweating, and you lose 2% of your body weight.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.820]   That alone is enough to reduce accuracy and performance.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.780]   So the classic study we talk about here
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.020]   was in basketball players.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.140]   So shooting accuracy, so free throw shooting,
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.580]   I think is specifically what they looked at.
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.900]   Significant reduction in performance
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.820]   with as little as 2% dehydration.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.620]   At that level, you also see a significant increase
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.060]   in perception of difficulty of exercise.
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.540]   And so only right at 2%.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.460]   And again, when I say 2%, I mean percent body weight lost.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.660]   Right, that's what that means.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.340]   You start getting the three, four or 5% dehydration,
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.700]   you start having a significant reduction in blood volume.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.020]   And that's incredibly important for endurance.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.700]   Your blood becomes viscous, it gets hard to pump through,
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.260]   and you're gonna start having all kinds of issues.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.060]   So being dehydrated is again,
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.700]   not only going to reduce performance,
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.320]   but because of the mental aspect,
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.480]   which we just walked through, and neuromuscular issue,
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.480]   you're gonna lose accuracy,
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.120]   you're gonna lose total endurance performance,
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.200]   and you're gonna lose speed and power.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.600]   So we have the triad there.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.840]   No matter what you're interested in,
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.880]   it's gonna be harmed by being dehydrated.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.620]   That also is happening then
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.280]   if you're starting your program dehydrated.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.760]   So if you're already 1% or so dehydrated,
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.320]   maybe you're like a little under hydrated
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.440]   and you lose a little bit of sweat,
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.960]   you've already hit that 2%.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.960]   And so we're starting to see reductions
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.980]   in performance there.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.040]   The same happens on the other side of that hormetic curve.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.760]   So if you are optimally hydrated in some large window,
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.280]   but you start going past that,
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.880]   we can start running into equal problems.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.680]   Remember, there is a need for an optimal concentration
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.860]   of sodium and potassium and chloride
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.840]   between your cell, inside your cell and outside your cell.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.680]   These are electrolytes.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.760]   This is what we call osmolality and osmolarity,
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.600]   is really what it is.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.260]   Think of it like concentration and osmosis,
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.580]   if you remember those terms.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.480]   So if we are trying to create a muscle contraction
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.500]   that requires an electrical gradient.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.460]   And so sodium and potassium,
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.300]   specifically in magnesium, calcium are positively charged
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.060]   and chloride is negatively charged.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.860]   And we need to have a certain amount inside the cell
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.520]   and outside the cell so that the positives
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.980]   and the negatives are balanced appropriately
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.280]   so that when we move one, we change the voltage
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.620]   and we have in the case of a muscle contraction.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.940]   Okay, I just skimmed through a whole lot of physiology there
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.520]   to say, if you then go mess with fluid only,
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.440]   and you say, if I were to give you a bolus
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.780]   of three liters of pure water right now,
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.300]   you're going to dilute your blood.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.500]   And so there's not going to be as many chemical,
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.340]   there won't be as many electrical signals in there
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.940]   'cause you've taken the same amount of sodium,
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.100]   potassium, et cetera,
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.420]   and put it in a larger volume of pure water.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.980]   So that gradient is now changed.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.860]   That becomes a significant problem for contraction.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.420]   I mean, quite literally it can kill you.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.380]   This is what we call hyponatremia.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.860]   So notremia is spelled N-A, hypo being low.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.620]   Hyponatremia, if you actually go to the periodic chart,
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.780]   N-A is what we use for sodium.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.140]   So hyponatremia, it's 'cause the word is natremia actually.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.260]   So what that literally means is low sodium.
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.400]   And you didn't get that from sweating out all your sodium.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.020]   You actually get hyponatremia from drinking in too much water
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.040]   so it's not that the total amount of sodium gets low,
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.740]   it's the fact that the concentration gets low
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.580]   from excessive fluid intake.
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.720]   So in the extremes, in fact, if you look at the literature,
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.540]   you'll see anywhere between like two to 15% of people
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.540]   who finish endurance races are into hyponatremia.
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.660]   Now that varies wildly if you're doing Ironman and Kona
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.660]   versus like, you know, the marathon in Denver in October.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.940]   It's gonna be totally different
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.180]   depending on other conditions, but these are all important.
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.980]   So while like death happens, that is sort of extreme,
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.380]   if you back up just a little bit,
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.660]   you start seeing the same types of performance increments.
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.780]   In fact, the symptoms can be identical.
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.380]   Brain fog, confusion, performance, irritation,
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.740]   a GI distress, and you think, man,
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.260]   these are symptoms of dehydration
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.300]   so then you drink more water
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.000]   and you're just exacerbating the problem.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.740]   And I can actually give you one little example of this.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.260]   We had an executive, actually a female CEO,
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.580]   I'll say she's probably was in her early 40s.
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.560]   And so she came to us and she thought, man, for sure,
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.220]   she has some sort of gut problem going on
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.060]   'cause we hear a lot about kind of like gut health
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.060]   and how it affects everything.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.900]   And so she's just like, I have brain fog
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.140]   and I've done all these things and I got blood work done.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.940]   And everything's fine, like nothing's going on.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.180]   I think I must have some sort of gut thing going on
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.820]   or whatever, and it's okay.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.300]   And we just started going through her stuff
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:10.300]   and she was, I think about 170 pounds, plus or minus.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:14.000]   And she was consuming like 250 to 60 ounces of water a day.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.460]   That's a ton of water.
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.420]   And we were like, holy shit, what are you doing this for?
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.340]   And she's just like, that's sort of like my thing.
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.260]   It was, but she didn't realize it was more
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.960]   of like a nervous tick than it was anything else, right?
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.220]   She just like sip, sip, sip, sip, sip water.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.100]   I'm like, man, how often did you go pee?
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.780]   And she's like, yeah, like every 30 minutes or something.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.940]   I'm like, fantastic sleep problems, focus.
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.220]   And so she's smashing caffeine.
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.980]   She was at like eight cups of coffee a day.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.240]   - Which is also gonna add to excretion of sodium.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.200]   - Totally, right?
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.420]   So it's like, okay, we don't really need to come in
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.100]   and run a sleep study on you.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.060]   We're just gonna lower your water.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.700]   And she was like, what?
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.060]   We dropped her down to like 180.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.620]   So basically an ounce per pound of body weight,
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.420]   which is still high 'cause she did train.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.500]   - 180 ounces.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.700]   - Correct.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.700]   She does work out, so she needed to replenish some stuff.
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.100]   And we'll cover these numbers in a second.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.860]   Instantaneously, I mean like two days in,
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.860]   she's like, oh my God,
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.580]   I haven't slept six straight hours in years.
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.180]   And then after that, it was like,
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.800]   basically tears coming back to us, right?
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.340]   My focus, my brain fog is gone
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.140]   'cause she's in a very high pressure job.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.180]   It's like, everything's coming back.
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.640]   Like now she was down to three or so cups of coffee a day,
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.480]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.740]   Like the whole thing, digestion improved, all of it.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.980]   She was, like her only problem after all the analysis
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.380]   was she was just drinking way, way too much water.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.020]   And adding more salt to her
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.300]   would not have solved the problem
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.380]   'cause she would have just had simply
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.500]   way too much fluid in her system.
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.940]   She was having all kinds of ADH problems and aldosterone,
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.580]   like the whole thing that that rolls into cortisol.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.940]   The whole like system goes into chaos.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.540]   So it is important that you pay attention hydration,
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.580]   even though as you sort of mentioned,
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.860]   people tend to just kind of like roll their eyes around it.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.100]   Because if you're in the middle, it's fine.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.760]   But if you're anywhere past, not even the extreme extremes,
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.660]   but just that first standard deviation away,
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.660]   you're gonna have problems
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.100]   and you might be thinking adrenal fatigue.
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.300]   You might be thinking your testosterone,
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.540]   like you're gonna think all these things
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:07.700]   and you simply just haven't
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.780]   actually dialed in your hydration.
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.060]   - Yeah, I think people sometimes roll their eyes
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.260]   at the discussion of hydration
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.900]   because it just doesn't sound very sexy.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.860]   It's not like, doesn't sound like a neurotransmitter
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:19.700]   or a hormone.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.960]   It doesn't sound like testosterone or estrogen or DHEA
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   or dopamine, but it actually is all of those things.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.780]   It sits at a level beneath all of those,
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.020]   but not beneath on a hierarchy,
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.700]   beneath in terms of a foundation.
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.240]   It's actually without proper electrolyte balance
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.580]   and hydration, none of the cells of the body can function.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.900]   And then I think people also hear that,
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.260]   oh, you know, we are 70% water.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:48.260]   And somehow like that statistic alone
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.960]   where that fact alone doesn't seem to stimulate
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.800]   any kind of actionable takeaway.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.240]   It's like, great, you know, like gravity also keeps us,
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.600]   you know, from jumping as high as we like.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.680]   You know, what do I do?
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.760]   And so I think it's important that people understand
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.080]   that every cellular process in the body
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.680]   critically relies on having enough sodium, magnesium,
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.480]   potassium around and the way that it's concentrated
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.800]   in fluid, water, is really the way that you allow
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.920]   every cell in their body to function
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.040]   as well as it possibly could and respond
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.640]   to all of the sorts of kind of quote unquote
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.240]   high performance tools that we're talking about.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.520]   The other thing I've observed many times over
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.880]   is that if people are ingesting too much water
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.420]   and also drinking a lot of caffeine
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.380]   and their electrolytes are low, they get shaky
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.640]   and they actually can have anxiety like symptoms.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.160]   When people come into my lab to do studies
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.240]   on anxiety and fear, we ask a few questions
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.760]   and those questions include how much water
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.260]   they've had that day.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.360]   Also a sort of bizarre fact, but one that I think
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.900]   is worth mentioning is that when the bladder is full,
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.700]   it stimulates a sort of anxiety.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.740]   If you ever had to urinate very badly
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.540]   and you're in the car or you can't urinate
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.900]   and then you get to the door, like that's,
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.420]   talk about an anxiety.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.920]   And that's because there's a direct neural pathway
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.060]   from the bladder that registers the mechanosensors,
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.520]   how much stretch there is on the bladder
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.240]   that sends a signal to the brainstem alertness areas,
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.560]   broadly speaking, locus coeruleus and others,
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.560]   that wake us up.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.160]   These are the, when we're awake, it makes us more awake
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.840]   and when we're asleep, this is what wakes us up
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.180]   to urinate in the middle of the night.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.520]   - Yeah, that's actually why you can use night urination
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.560]   as a pretty good diagnostic of sleep disorders.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.520]   So if, 'cause of vasopressin, right?
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.360]   Exactly what you're talking about.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.320]   If you're having sleep disorder issues
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.920]   and you're staying awake and a vasopressin gets taken off,
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.000]   right, an APN goes straight to the kidneys,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.160]   your kidneys are supposed to be dormant basically at night.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.360]   You're not supposed to be filtering a lot
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.080]   and producing a lot of urine at night.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.000]   If that's happening and say you have any number
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.440]   of apneas kicking on or anything going on,
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.520]   vasopressin keeps going, keeps sending a signal,
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.360]   kidneys start filtering.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.480]   So if you're waking up and peeing multiple times at night,
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.560]   that's called nocturia, that is a very, very good sign
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.080]   that either one of two things happen.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.600]   One, you have some sort of sleep disorder
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.000]   or two, you're drinking outrageous amounts of water.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.040]   And so that's actually a bit of a backwards cycle now,
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.680]   right, because you're drinking way too much water,
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.600]   you're waking up and peeing all night,
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.240]   that's actually ruining your sleep.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.120]   And so we have seen this a number of times
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.480]   with our sleep company as we go in
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.720]   and it's just like, you don't need any of this crap.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.240]   You just need to be properly hydrated.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.240]   Alternatively, if your hydration is sound
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.240]   and you're still waking up more than one time a night
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.240]   to pee on average, then you almost,
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.480]   well, I shouldn't say it like that,
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.200]   but there's a potential that you actually have
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.660]   some sort of sleep disorder or sleep condition going in.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.400]   So the rule of thumb on that is over here,
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.200]   once a night or so of urination is fine.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.640]   If it is routinely or consistently more than two,
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.740]   you need to make some adjustments, start with hydration.
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.980]   It's the simplest way, right, getting a full sleep study done
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.600]   just figure out hydration.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.160]   We've had this happen a number of times
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.820]   where people wanna get more health conscious
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.800]   and they just get, they hear things like this
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.940]   and they're like, I gotta get on my water.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.240]   And then they just start train wrecking their sleep
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.080]   and they're waking it up.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.160]   So if you're waking up multiple times and you're urinating
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.160]   and it is a large amount of urine for you and it is clear,
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.780]   that's probably not sleep apnea induced nocturia.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.320]   That's probably excessive hydration.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.140]   If you're waking up a bunch of times
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:11.140]   and it's fairly small amounts of urine,
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.400]   then it's probably not the fluid issue.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.440]   It's probably the fact that the vasopressin
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.980]   is kicking your kidneys into gear.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.320]   So that's not a perfect criteria,
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.920]   but it's just like a quick little tool you can sort of use.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.960]   That's actually one of the reasons why we measure
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.480]   almost always your body weight at night
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.380]   as well as in the morning.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:33.040]   So that's like the combat sport in the UFC fighters boxers.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.620]   We call that your float, so how much you floated overnight.
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.540]   I like to know that number 'cause I wanna know as well,
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:39.960]   your first morning void.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.760]   So when you wake up and you went to bed at 200 pounds,
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.200]   you woke up the next morning at 195.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.560]   Oh, you floated five pounds.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:48.400]   Did you pee last night?
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.920]   Yeah, yeah, three times.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.080]   Interesting.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.520]   In other case, you woke up, you went to bed at 200 pounds.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.120]   You wake up at 199.5.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.380]   Okay, you're dehydrated
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.280]   'cause you should have a certain amount of fluid
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.960]   that you're just respirating out as you're breathing
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.080]   throughout your nose, throughout night ideally,
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.160]   guaranteed you're gonna wake up.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.000]   What was your urine like?
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.440]   Oh yeah, a little bit pretty dark,
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.720]   like shocker, you're dehydrated.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.960]   So you can kind of look at numbers like that.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.560]   A general float is something like a pound to two pounds
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.000]   for the 170 plus pound person.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.720]   As you scale up, that number can go up a little bit,
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.740]   but you can kind of use these to triage a little bit
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.500]   about what's going on with this kind of combination.
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.680]   Everything is everything, right?
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.520]   So it's like, it's not just about one system.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.460]   So you're gonna pay attention.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:30.640]   You can also look, well, I don't know,
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.800]   if you wanna jump into it, we can,
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.700]   but there's a whole bunch of ways I can teach you
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.320]   to diagnose hydration and then maybe we can start there
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.880]   and then we can talk about hydration numbers.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.080]   Yes, I'd love to talk about diagnostics for hydration,
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.620]   over hydration, dehydration.
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:48.480]   To start off, would you be willing to give us some numbers?
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.280]   How much water should we be drinking?
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.680]   - The classic rule here,
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.220]   and you're making me do what I hate, right?
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.400]   I wanna give all the caveats first,
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.880]   but I'll go straight to your number.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.320]   Half an ounce per pound of body weight is a rough rule.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.600]   So if you weigh, again, 200 pounds,
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.800]   that would mean you drink 100 ounces of water a day.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.880]   Most water bottles are like 12 to 20 ounces,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.720]   something like that.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.980]   So you end up drinking six of those or so a day,
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.980]   kind of like plus or minus, which is not that unreasonable.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.600]   This does depend on a number of factors
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.640]   which I could go over, but that is a rough starting place.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.560]   The only other thing to add to that is
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.080]   that does not account for exercise-induced water loss
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.640]   or sauna or anything like that.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.740]   So that's assuming just like basal daily needs.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.160]   If you are exercising or sweating at all for any reasons,
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.280]   or work-related, so folks that work outside or in the heat
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.920]   or a humid environment, these numbers all change
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.540]   and you can slide the scale up.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.360]   But you generally wanna drink about 125%
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.880]   of the fluids you've lost during that physical activity back.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.420]   - And how much do you lose per hour of exercise?
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.160]   - That number ranges between one to five pounds,
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.040]   depending on the person.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.500]   Nick can even be higher with some of our athletes.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.200]   Like I can think of a number of NFL players right now
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.800]   that's not uncommon for those guys to do eight or nine pounds
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.660]   even not even like crazy circumstances.
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.120]   If it's August and we're in Jacksonville,
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.840]   it's not wild for those guys to go nine, 10 pounds.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.120]   - But what about the typical person
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.000]   who goes to a air conditioned gym
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.580]   or goes out for a run on a day that is somewhere between,
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:23.560]   let's say 55 degrees Fahrenheit and 85 degrees Fahrenheit?
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.080]   - You're probably looking at like a pound.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.120]   It's not extremely high.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.660]   If you are totally soaked, might be like a pound
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.540]   and a half to two pounds.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.120]   If you're like come back and like your pits
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.160]   are a little sweaty and there's a little bit of water
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.880]   kind of on your neckline,
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.860]   it's probably like more like a pound or so.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.560]   So in that case, you might drink back
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.260]   a pound and a half of water.
[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.600]   - Okay, so just to review these numbers
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.560]   to make sure that I'm on the correct page here.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:52.440]   A half an ounce of fluid per pound of body weight
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.760]   is a sort of a foundation for hydration.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   And then you want to replace 125% of the fluid loss
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.840]   during exercise and exercise varies,
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.520]   where exercise is done varies,
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.400]   whether or not people are wearing uniforms or helmets
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.000]   is gonna impact how much fluid they lose, et cetera.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.320]   In a very hot environment, the amount of fluid lost
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.280]   can be anywhere from one to five,
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.480]   maybe even 10 pounds per hour of hard exertion.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.080]   For most exercise done in conditions
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.240]   of 55 degrees Fahrenheit to seven,
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.360]   to excuse me, 85 degrees Fahrenheit,
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.120]   done with some degree of effort,
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.000]   one might lose a pound or two pounds of water.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.880]   - Super easy way to find out.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.480]   All you have to do is weigh yourself naked,
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.660]   go do your workout, come back in, dry off,
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.160]   weigh yourself naked.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.560]   That'll tell you exactly what you lost.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.200]   So if you went in, you were 160 pounds,
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.760]   you come back out, you weigh 158, you lost two pounds,
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.440]   drink back two and a half pounds of water, you're good.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.920]   So that is, honestly, it's like fairly gold standard
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:57.760]   for identifying.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.760]   You can actually buy a whole bunch of technology for this
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.940]   and they are using the exact same equation,
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.800]   which is your body weight when you were there.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.560]   Now, if you do that though, you do need to account
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.520]   for any fluid you drank during the workout
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.800]   'cause that then offsets it.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.600]   - Simple, but I think important question,
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.900]   we're talking about a half an ounce of fluid
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.800]   per pound of body weight.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.440]   Does that include things like coffee, tea, soda,
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.400]   pre-workout drinks, mid-workout drinks,
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.800]   Monte, matcha, whatever, there's a Yerba Monte,
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.160]   there are a million things out there, or just water?
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.860]   - Any fluid for the most part is gonna count.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.000]   - And is it true that fluids that contain caffeine
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.100]   generally cause us to secrete sodium?
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.440]   - Yeah.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.360]   - Okay, so do you recommend including electrolyte powder
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.660]   or a small pinch of sodium or any number of other
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.200]   supplement type electrolytes that can replace
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.240]   that sodium, magnesium, and potassium?
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.560]   - A couple of things we have to pay attention to
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.720]   to accurately answer that question.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.960]   What you also sort of asked about,
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.720]   you may have not even realized,
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.960]   is does caffeine actually enhance dehydration?
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.280]   Which is not really what you asked,
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.000]   but it's probably a lot of people thought that as well.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.600]   So caffeine can, but coffee doesn't necessarily do that
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.520]   because remember you're co-ingesting that with fluid.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.480]   And so we used to say that all the time,
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.740]   I'll coffee dehydrate too.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.120]   It doesn't, it might make your urine yellow.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.640]   It certainly gives off an odor in your urine,
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.520]   but in general coffee will not do that
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.360]   because you're ingesting this.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.660]   If you were to now be taking caffeine pills alone,
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.000]   now there is a bit of a diuretic effect there.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:34.920]   And so you're gonna urinate.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:35.740]   How much?
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:39.040]   Maybe not enough for you to be really concerned with,
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.580]   especially when you balance that against
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.040]   the ergogenic effects and benefits of caffeine.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.000]   It's not something we are concerned about.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.100]   Second part of your question,
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.200]   do you need to then offset the loss of sodium?
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.880]   I'm not super concerned about the amount of sodium loss
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.960]   to caffeine.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.040]   I am more concerned about simply the amount of sodium
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.260]   being correct because of the bigger circumstances,
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.840]   like how much is actually in your system
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.360]   and how much you lost in the training session.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.360]   So it's not the caffeine that I care about that much
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.440]   relative to, you know, if you lost three grams of sodium
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.600]   because of the training and you added another few milligrams
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.340]   because the caffeine, I don't really care or didn't.
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.720]   - I'm glad you brought up the difference
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.720]   between a substance like caffeine
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.980]   and the vehicle it's contained in, like coffee.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.160]   This is all really important.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.840]   And it also raises a question about individual differences
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.980]   in sweating ability.
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:31.100]   And I call it sweating ability because I have a good friend
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.560]   I've known for ages, really.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.120]   I actually work with him in my laboratory as well.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.400]   And he's one of these people that the moment he starts
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.740]   any physical activity, it's like a flood warning, right?
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.260]   He just soaks through clothing.
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.020]   It's just the sweating adaptation
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.760]   is exceedingly robust in him.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.060]   Other people less so.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.160]   So is it true that sweating and our ability
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.240]   to dump heat through it by loss of water
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.560]   is something that we tend to vary on
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.400]   and that also that we can build up that capacity.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.600]   I know a number of people are probably thinking,
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.020]   ew, gross, why would I want to sweat more?
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.320]   But there's actually a huge advantage
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.800]   to be able to dump body heat during exertion
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.480]   because body heat in some ways
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.800]   sets the cap for performance.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.240]   - In many, many ways.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.880]   - Including mental performance.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.920]   Our ability to stay alert often is enhanced by it being cold
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.800]   and of course we all want to warm up properly.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.020]   But in terms of loss of fluid through sweating,
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.820]   is there a way to easily bend ourselves
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:29.480]   into kind of a low sweater, medium sweater, heavy sweater?
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.200]   That sounds like an article of clothing.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.920]   But in any case, you know what I'm, you know what I mean.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.800]   - Man, another, a lot to say here.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.440]   Wish we had a whole series on this.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.540]   - Listen, if we have to go 17 hours, we can do it.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.240]   Just everybody, hydrate well.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:46.840]   - I think we've shown the listeners that is a real threat.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.280]   That's a very real threat.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.340]   Podcasting to failure.
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.960]   You don't have to do every set in the gym to failure,
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.760]   but here we are attempting to podcast failure.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.760]   In all seriousness, what is the role of sweating ability?
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.800]   And is this something that any of us should care about
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.480]   or train for or pay attention to?
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.820]   Or is this just kind of getting into the arcane?
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.600]   - Number one, you can train your ability to sweat.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.960]   This is important for heat acclimation.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.400]   And why that matters, when you sweat,
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.800]   that actually is not what regulates your temperature.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.600]   What you want to have happen is the fluid to hit your skin
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:20.720]   and not to be evaporated.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.100]   That's the actual mechanism.
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.240]   So in fact, if you stop sweating,
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.960]   you can guarantee within a short amount of time,
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.560]   you're gonna be done moving.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.080]   - Oh, very interesting.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.360]   I hope people heard that
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.280]   and really are highlighting that in their mind,
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.480]   that sweating is a process of bringing fluid from your body
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.840]   onto the surface of your skin.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.640]   And then the heat dumping aspect of sweating
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.040]   is the evaporation of that off your body,
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.920]   which brings to mind all sorts of ideas about
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.760]   how to dress during exercise, et cetera.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.040]   But what you said is that if you are not sweating enough,
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.960]   you are limiting your output capacity.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.040]   So it's not just about having enough fluid to sweat.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.120]   It's also about being able to sweat
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.720]   and being dressed appropriately
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.380]   to allow that sweat to move, to evaporate off your body.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.860]   - Yep, and heat acclimation training
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:10.280]   is as simple as it sounds.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.740]   So just practice it more.
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.720]   So if you're going into a process
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.560]   where you either need to be in a hot environment
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.240]   or you need to improve your sweat rate,
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.320]   you just need to practice sweating
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.600]   and your body will get better at that.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.560]   Practice a sauna, practice a jacuzzi.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.880]   Just get in those things
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.680]   and you will improve your ability to do that.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.660]   Now, there is a huge genetic component.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.400]   I have one individual, actually a UFC fighter
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.240]   I've been working with,
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.400]   and I don't mind mentioning his name.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.800]   He'll give me full permission, Scott Holtzman.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.400]   Many, many years, he's actually fighting right now.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.000]   Actually today he'll be going.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.360]   He is, he is like you described,
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.360]   like buckets and buckets and buckets of fluids
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.420]   come off this guy when he's tying his shoes.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:50.440]   He just goes, right?
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.680]   And we've improved that.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.880]   I actually sweat too much.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.640]   We worked on that a lot early in his career
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.920]   and we got some improvements down
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.240]   to get him to hold onto the fluids better.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.120]   That being said, I've worked with other individuals
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.320]   in his weight category and it's the opposite, right?
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.360]   So we can have them literally
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.480]   do the exact same training session together
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.900]   and Scott will dump six pounds
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.720]   and other folks at his size will dump two, two and a half.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.500]   So there's a genetic component that is just there
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.460]   and you don't need to worry about it there.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:17.720]   So can you identify if you are a heavy salt sweater or not?
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.600]   Well, you have a whole bunch of routes for this.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.280]   Number one is you can use the old free,
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.600]   cost free test of just looking at your clothing.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.420]   And if you're seeing that white residue all over it,
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:29.640]   so you've all have the friend
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.600]   who probably wears that same baseball hat
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.000]   that they've had for eight years.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.780]   If it is covered in the white junk all over the place,
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.180]   that's a sign of a higher salt sweater
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.020]   if the opposite happens.
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:43.800]   And it's like you can pull their clothing back
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.780]   and there's just nothing there.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.540]   There may be a little bit of a lower salt sweater.
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:53.540]   You can also use any number of hydration tests.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.320]   I know that there is some coming out in the market
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.420]   very, very soon that can give you theoretically real time
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.540]   measurements just like a CGM would be.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.100]   Although I haven't seen any data on
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.800]   if those are accurate or not, I haven't used one yet.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.860]   But there are a number that are out super cheap,
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.060]   10, 15, 20 blocks all the way up to a couple of hundred
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.120]   dollars where you can buy these patches,
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.320]   put them on you and get a reasonably close estimate.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:19.120]   And again, if those things are five or 10 or 20% off,
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.440]   I don't know, have to see independent data come out first.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.040]   But even if they are, you're not worried
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.820]   about the specific milligrams, right?
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.600]   Whether you sweat out 1,250 milligrams in a workout
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.000]   or if it's 1,340, it doesn't really matter.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.280]   You're trying to look for big, big numbers, right?
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:36.360]   Are you losing 500 milligrams using three and a half grams
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.200]   where you're at?
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   So those things will get you in the ballpark
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.360]   to do exactly what you decide.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.160]   Am I high, medium or low?
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.400]   And there's a lot of them that I've used in the past.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.640]   So that's another way to go about it.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.840]   Then what you wanna do is probably match
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.680]   your electrolyte intake to something close to what you sweat.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.420]   That's the ideal scenario.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:58.180]   You can get a lot of information about hydration from blood.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.080]   You can look at like acute markers of dehydration,
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.160]   like hemoglobin, hematocrit.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:06.560]   If your hemoglobin is like 15 plus, it's funny.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.320]   We've talked about this in a few episodes before,
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.760]   but I see that and I'm like, man, that dude's super fit.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:14.080]   That's like a 15 for hemoglobin would be pretty high,
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.300]   14 or so would be pretty good for a female.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.720]   That's also the exact same thing
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.040]   as the sign of acute dehydration.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.280]   So hematocrit, same thing.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.040]   If you're north of 50%, you're probably dehydrated.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.360]   So you can get a lot.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.000]   There are also though a lot of biomarkers
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.400]   that can tell you more about chronic dehydration.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.680]   So you can run through those things as well.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.280]   So a good blood chemistry test can tell you a lot
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.440]   and you can actually get some insights
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.760]   in your sodium and potassium.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.240]   Albumin is another fantastic way
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.960]   to measure longer term hydration status.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.040]   Now one of these amazing globulins
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.060]   that we've sort of talked a lot about.
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.460]   So you can do all those things.
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:49.000]   You can also simply measure the body weight pre-imposed
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.600]   and use a sweat patch or not,
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:53.420]   and use the freer version of your clothing test
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:56.020]   and get a rough idea of where you're getting it from.
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.720]   So those are good places to start.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.440]   I wanna go back though and make sure I wasn't over
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.560]   terrifying the audience too much on a sort of a piece.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.880]   If you're performing a type of training
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.880]   or exercise or sport in which you're not losing
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.520]   more than 2% of your body weight,
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.800]   you don't need to be overly concerned
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.360]   about hydrating in the sport.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.440]   And so we can actually get into some equations
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.160]   for how much water to drink during training right now.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.440]   But if you're again losing less than that, it's not critical.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.920]   You can have some fluids that like makes you feel better,
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.120]   but you're not gonna be experiencing tremendous amounts
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.120]   of performance increments.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.780]   If you're, again, out playing a baseball game
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.360]   and it's 50 degrees out, you're fine.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.200]   You can drink some water,
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.400]   but that's not gonna be compromising performance or recovery.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.100]   So we can actually then, if you'd like,
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:45.360]   I can go through the three-step system
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.020]   for optimizing hydration,
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.420]   but I wanna make sure I planted that flag
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.400]   so people aren't just terrified
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.200]   that they gotta be guzzling down water
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.480]   if they're going to their physical therapist
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.320]   for some stretching.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.180]   That's probably not super important.
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.440]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.900]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.560]   Athletic Greens is a vitamin, mineral, probiotic,
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:06.040]   and adaptogen drink designed to help you meet
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.520]   all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.780]   I've been taking Athletic Greens daily since 2012,
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:14.400]   so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.000]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.840]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:20.260]   once or twice a day is that it helps me meet
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.340]   all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.440]   That is, it covers my vitamins, my minerals,
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.000]   and the probiotics are especially important to me.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.140]   Athletic Greens also contains adaptogens,
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.160]   which are critical for recovering from stress,
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.800]   from exercise, from work, or just general life.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.180]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.900]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:38.980]   to claim a special offer.
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.520]   They'll give you five free travel packs

[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.580]   Again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.120]   go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.680]   to claim the special offer.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.480]   I would love for you to tell us
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.940]   what I refer to as the Galpin equation.
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:55.940]   Understanding, of course,
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:57.900]   that you did not name it the Galpin equation.
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.640]   Listen, folks, scientists can have things named after them,
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:04.760]   but in general, it's not reflective of healthy psychology
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.540]   if they name things after themselves.
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:07.380]   - Correct.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:08.920]   - Sometimes, yes, neuroanatomists used to do that,
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.140]   but in any case, Dr. Andy Galpin did not name
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:13.520]   the Galpin equation after himself.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.320]   I named it after him and the Galpin equation
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.060]   for how much fluid to ingest during exercise is?
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.820]   - You want to take your body weight in pounds
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.580]   and divide that by 30.
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.680]   And you want to consume that number,
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:31.340]   which would be in ounces, about every 15 to 20 minutes.
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.440]   So in the example of you being 200 pounds,
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.600]   you would take 200 divided by 30,
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.240]   which is, let's just call that number seven to be close,
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:42.180]   which means you would consume about seven ounces of water
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:44.560]   every 15 or 20 minutes or so.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.400]   - Okay.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.540]   - Now, as a little bit of a point,
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:47.660]   while I also did not name it,
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.560]   I also didn't do the research.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.480]   It's important to point out
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.520]   that other scientists figured these things out.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.880]   I just read their papers
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.280]   and made that derivation of their equation
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.620]   to make it a little bit easier for us folks
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.880]   who do not work on the metric system.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:00.820]   - Okay, a couple of things.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.520]   First of all, I'm not 200 pounds,
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.660]   but it doesn't matter how much I weigh
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.400]   because the point is that the listener
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.240]   - Correct.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.240]   - Should take their body weight in pounds divided by 30
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.960]   and just that number of ounces in fluid every 15 minutes.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.640]   And then for those out there outside the US
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.620]   that are accustomed to thinking in milliliters
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:22.020]   and liters, not ounces and kilograms, not pounds,
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.020]   what is the Galpin equation in the metric system?
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.880]   - This would be two milliliters per kilogram,
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.760]   which again, if you were, let's say 200 pounds,
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.420]   that's going to be something roughly like,
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:35.640]   we'll call it 90 kilos.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.500]   And so if you did two milliliters per kilo,
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.920]   you'd be something like 180 milliliters of fluid,
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.260]   again, every 15 or 20 minutes.
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:44.100]   - Great.
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.360]   And how should people ingest that fluid?
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:49.520]   And of course, I would imagine it's through their mouth,
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.360]   I would hope.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.180]   - I hope.
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.060]   - Other orifices that it might suffice,
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:55.180]   but let's not go there.
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:57.520]   They're drinking that water consistently,
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.940]   or is it every 15 minutes they slug it back?
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:01.140]   Does it matter?
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.620]   - Okay, yeah, that's very good.
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.860]   A handful of things.
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.620]   In general, when you talk hydration,
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:08.700]   the slower and steady, you can go the better.
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:11.900]   In fact, the reason this two milliliters per kilogram
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:15.340]   number came out is because a number of trials were run,
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.220]   when they looked at that every 15 minutes,
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:21.380]   just one bolus of it, in different derivations.
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:25.300]   And it's pretty clear that the slower pace one could do it,
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.140]   the better.
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:27.660]   So whether you're doing it every 10 minutes
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:29.920]   or 15 or 20 minutes, the reason we actually give that gap
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.020]   is because you have to be also offset
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.060]   a little bit of GI distress.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.740]   In fact, like kind of the four golden rules of recovery,
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:40.840]   if you will, we use sort of three R's.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.900]   You need to rebuild, rehydrate, and replenish.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.660]   What that really means is you need to have
[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:46.740]   a continuous glucose stream.
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:49.460]   You need to have a continuous amino acid stream.
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.380]   You need to hydrate.
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.940]   And you need to do all one, two, and three
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:56.180]   without disturbing your gut too much.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.660]   And so in this particular case, it
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.940]   was sort of found that we can hit that level in general
[00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:03.900]   and be just fine for most people.
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.500]   So I mean, a little bit of context.
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.260]   The example we gave there in both cases,
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:10.980]   it's something like six to seven ounces for 15 or 20 minutes.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:14.680]   If you think about that, there are 16 ounces in a pound.
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.940]   And most water bottles, like if you go buy a water bottle
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:18.580]   at a store here, they generally come
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.700]   in like 16 ounce bottles-ish.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.300]   So six or seven ounces is really like a third
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:27.700]   of a water bottle, maybe, every 15 or 20 or so minutes.
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:29.760]   So it's not some egregious amount of water
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.600]   that you have to slam down.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.020]   Now, that is influenced heavily
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:36.540]   by how hydrated you started the session with,
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.460]   so how hydrated you came in.
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.480]   External factors like heat, humidity,
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:41.520]   temperature, things like that.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.260]   But that gives you a rough idea that, again,
[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:46.900]   and these are numbers that you would need
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.640]   to consume to optimize performance.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.740]   At the end of that, then is when you would look
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:57.180]   to see how much I lost, like we talked about earlier,
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:01.180]   and then add back that 125%, taking into account
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.520]   how much fluid you ingested.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:07.180]   So if you're 200 pounds and you drank a total of, say,
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.060]   a pound of water during the training,
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:12.920]   and you started off at 200 and you finished at 198,
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:17.640]   you actually lost three pounds, not two pounds,
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.980]   because you lost three, you drank one during it,
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.020]   so your final net number is two.
[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:26.200]   So now you really need to drink back 125%
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.060]   of that remaining two pounds, two and a half pounds,
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:30.200]   something like that.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.680]   These numbers, especially that 125,
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.140]   they're just rough guidelines.
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:38.100]   Some actually papers suggest it's all the way up to 150%.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.500]   So it's just like an idea.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:44.300]   Don't measure out whether you need 5.5 ounces or 6.2 ounces.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.540]   It just sort of gives you an idea of where to start.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.840]   All right, a few sips every 15 or 20 minutes
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.220]   is close enough.
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.020]   - I've actually started using the Galpin equation
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:56.860]   to determine how much fluid I need for mental work.
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:00.580]   Given the now robust data that are out there
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:03.120]   on the relationship between hydration and mental work,
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.500]   it's been very effective for me.
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.380]   And again, there are peer-reviewed studies
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:10.780]   that support the idea that hydration is important
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:13.780]   for proper mental clarity and energy and focus,
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:16.620]   and that even being slightly dehydrated can disrupt that.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:20.060]   But if one is drinking so much water
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:22.020]   that they're frequently going to the restroom
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:25.200]   and can't comfortably focus on the work they're doing,
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.180]   that's also an issue.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:28.900]   So that's very helpful.
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.740]   What are the three most critical features of hydration?
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:34.740]   And then I'd like to move on to some of the more particulars
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.620]   about supplementation and nutrition.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:41.620]   Three parts, start hydrated, maintain hydration throughout.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:45.940]   Part three is hydrate post to fix it, okay.
[00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:49.260]   We gave you the half ounce per pound of body weight equation
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.100]   so you start the training hydrated.
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:54.900]   We gave you the two milliliters per kilogram
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:58.180]   slash body weight divided by 30 to stay hydrated.
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:00.540]   Then we gave you the 125%.
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.300]   But I can actually just give you sort of,
[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.420]   I'm giving you another list here, I'm sorry.
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:08.420]   But it is my five step cheater guide
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.120]   for optimizing hydration for performance.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.340]   Sorry, step number one,
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.860]   drink a lot of water first thing in the morning.
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:15.380]   This gets everything kickstart, it gets you going.
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:17.160]   It also saves you from having to drink
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.580]   a bunch of water at night,
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.620]   which is then going to compromise your sleep.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:21.840]   - What's a lot?
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.140]   - Depending on how big you are,
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:25.100]   the general thing I'll tell people is like
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.500]   one of the very first things you should do
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.720]   throughout your day, you wake up, go to the bathroom.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.220]   As you're consuming your sunlight, consume water.
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:34.080]   This is maybe chugging a full glass.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.800]   It's honestly what I do, it's not the best route,
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.120]   but I'll just get that going.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:37.960]   - 16 ounces.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.120]   - 16 ounces or so is great, it's fine.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:43.620]   If you're larger, I'm 165 to 70 pounds,
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:45.040]   depending on what's going on,
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:46.780]   maybe a little higher sometimes.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:50.700]   If you're 225 pounds, maybe that number is 30 ounces.
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:52.500]   So you just sort of scale up and down.
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:53.860]   And the only reason I say a lot is
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.860]   it just depends on what you're doing.
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:56.980]   And I also should clarify,
[00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:59.040]   I don't really literally mean chug.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.400]   Just like sips, because the faster you drink water,
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.260]   the faster it's going to expand blood volume.
[00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.900]   The faster it extends blood volume,
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.340]   the faster you get rid of it.
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.260]   - I don't think a lot of people know that.
[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.300]   - Yeah, this is maybe this is clarifying.
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:13.420]   This is also, we sort of talked about earlier,
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.680]   if you drink too much water, you'll dilute the system.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.580]   Well, if you have a diluted system,
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:20.720]   your body's first reaction is to rid of water,
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.120]   to bring total blood volume down, right?
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.740]   Remember, if you were to go to a doctor
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:26.020]   and they looked at your total blood volume,
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:27.760]   they're like, man, you're five and a half liters.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.860]   You're going to be like, holy crap,
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:30.220]   you're going to be put on a diuretic
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.380]   because you don't want to have a heart attack
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:32.220]   and have blood pressure.
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:36.980]   - I wonder if people are drinking a 16 ounce glass of water
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:40.580]   or other fluid all at once before going to sleep.
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:42.100]   And that's why they're waking up in the middle of the night.
[00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:42.940]   - Totally.
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.020]   - Given what you just said,
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:47.540]   probably a better protocol would be to sip
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:50.100]   on a glass of water in the final hour
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:51.580]   or two hours before sleep.
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:53.340]   - Generally, the number we say is three hours.
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.660]   In the three hours preceding sleep,
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:56.900]   you want to basically limit fluid intake
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:58.700]   to sipping as needed.
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:02.120]   - I think that's, I'm going to start that tonight
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.780]   because I wake up generally once per night to use the bathroom
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:08.020]   and I do drink some fluids before I go to sleep,
[00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:10.400]   mostly because I'm pretty thirsty at that time.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.280]   But I'm going to start sipping that water
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.740]   in the three hours heading into sleep.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:18.940]   - Yeah, so you can actually pay attention to is,
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.940]   to go back, this is actually, I love doing this stuff,
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:23.540]   but if you're waking up at night
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:25.100]   and you have a very dry mouth.
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:27.220]   - Not for me.
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:28.860]   - All right, because it can be one of two things.
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:31.020]   You might actually be dehydrated.
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:32.600]   And so then the mistake people make is like,
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.620]   man, my mouth is so dry.
[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:36.000]   I keep getting up to drink water at night.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.600]   That makes you then pee too much.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:41.100]   What that also indicates is probably your mouth breathing.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:44.120]   So a lot of ways to fix people waking up
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:46.900]   and urinating too much at night is to tape your mouth
[00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:49.780]   and or use a dilator over your nose.
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.520]   And then what happens is you don't feel like
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.360]   you have a dry mouth.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.920]   So you don't get up to consume any extra water
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:54.760]   throughout the night.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.900]   So that actually reduces your fluid intake.
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.660]   So you don't have the problem of actually now having
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.520]   too much fluid to do it.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.420]   And so it's another reasons why mouth taping
[00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:03.620]   can really, really help.
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:08.240]   If you are having those issues and or snoring,
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.900]   those are not benign.
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.780]   That's a really, like you really should get
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:13.240]   some work on those.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:15.700]   Something, you're not sleeping very well
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:16.960]   is the way I'll say it.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.380]   It doesn't necessarily mean something life-threatening,
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:21.140]   but it's not a good thing.
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.680]   So you're gonna run kind of your triaging things
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:24.520]   back and forth.
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.700]   So if you're like, I'm waking up to pee a lot
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:27.860]   but my mouth isn't thirsty.
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:28.740]   Okay, great.
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.420]   Then you may actually have just a water consumption issue.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:35.140]   If it is, my mouth is dry, but I'm actually waking up
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:37.600]   and I'm having these large urinations,
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.980]   then you're not actually dehydrated.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:40.580]   You're just breathing through your mouth.
[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:43.100]   If you're waking up and your mouth is dry
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:44.180]   and there's not a lot of pee there,
[00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.260]   then you actually might actually legitimately be
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.180]   under hydrated.
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:49.460]   So a little bit of a game you can play there.
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:50.980]   - Well, that's super informative.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:55.980]   I think that the point alone that gulping a bunch of water
[00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:00.660]   all at once is going to cause you to need to excrete
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:05.660]   that water soon after is a really important point.
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.260]   Also for people that are going to, I don't know,
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.500]   give a talk or you don't want to have to get up
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.340]   to use the restroom.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:14.460]   You have to sit through a long meeting.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:17.020]   Clearly I'm violating all these rules up until right now.
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.980]   I've been, you know, not, I sort of followed
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:22.020]   the seagull approach to consuming fluids,
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:25.000]   just in enormous volumes.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.820]   I'm going to start sipping fluids instead.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.900]   What are some of the other rules of hydration?
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.740]   - So you're going to wake up, you're going to start your day
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.980]   and start hydrated.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.980]   So, you know, you're consuming a larger percentage
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.760]   of your water earlier in the day.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.700]   Then you get all the performance enhancing effects of water
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:44.500]   and you don't have to worry about it compromising your sleep.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.560]   So that's step number one.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.560]   Also now you're going to start your session
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.080]   closer to hydration.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:49.920]   All right, great.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.940]   Number two, eat mostly real whole foods.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.740]   Why?
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.580]   Interesting.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:00.360]   What you may or not have thought about is a huge determinant
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.200]   of your hydration status is your food choices.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.680]   If you look at different foods, for example, most fruit.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.200]   Watermelon, watermelon is like 95 plus percent water.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.880]   Like fantastic source.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.240]   Also, by the way, since we're here,
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.920]   it is not extremely high in carbohydrate.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.640]   It's not an extremely high in sugar.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.480]   It is by percentage,
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.560]   but since it is almost exclusively water you're eating,
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.880]   it is not something that is extremely dangerous
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.380]   in terms of sugar.
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.500]   There alone, probably all the things we've talked about
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.000]   in the six episodes, that comment right there
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.340]   will probably blow the internet to pieces
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.460]   and I'll probably get hate mail for life for it, but.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:37.140]   - From people throwing watermelons.
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:38.460]   - Yeah, oh my gosh, it's funny.
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:39.960]   - Well, I don't think the point is that sugar
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:40.900]   is necessarily bad.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.340]   I think the point is that for most people,
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.140]   they're ingesting too much sugar, most people.
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:47.480]   And it's interesting.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.620]   Oftentimes the people who are justifying the ingestion
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.180]   of sugar are exactly the kind of people
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.480]   that should not ingest so much sugar.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.320]   So there's a little bit of a user bias there.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.360]   - The point here is if you're eating whole, real food,
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:01.240]   this is like, now we're kind of splitting hairs
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.320]   about those things, so.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.820]   - So morning hydration, consumed food.
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.720]   - Yeah, now, important point here.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.620]   If you compare it to other foods,
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:14.300]   like actually meat is a very high percentage of fluid,
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.720]   depending on how well or long you've cooked it.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.620]   You will just remember you said earlier,
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.800]   over 70% water, right?
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.640]   So if you're eating meat,
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.120]   you're getting actually a big chunk of water.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.040]   As you cook it, of course, you lose some of that.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.840]   But meat can be like,
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.800]   I wouldn't call it a hydrating food item,
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.640]   but it is not as low as something like a biscuit,
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.840]   which can be actually like 10% water.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.000]   That's why it's like dry and dense,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.060]   which doesn't mean it's bad for you.
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:38.300]   But there, if you're eating highly processed foods,
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.620]   almost by association,
[01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:42.480]   that means they've been dehydrated or partially, right?
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.560]   So you're just getting less total fluid intake.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.760]   In addition, they have also been highly salted in general.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:49.720]   So now we're in this position
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.240]   where we're under hydrated and highly salted, bad spot.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.840]   If you now switch over to mostly,
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.360]   again, just mostly whole real food-ish,
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.680]   whatever that means to you,
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.160]   then your hydration is gonna skyrocket.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:02.980]   You're gonna have a lot.
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:04.000]   So you're eating a ton of food.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.040]   In fact, it should be a large percentage
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.400]   of the fluid intake you have actually
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.600]   should be coming from your food.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.760]   You shouldn't have to be smashing water bottles
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.320]   after a water bottle all day.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.720]   In that case though, you do need to add salt back.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.520]   So we do see this a lot
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.960]   with people who try to make a transition
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.000]   for maybe a suboptimal nutritional lifestyle.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.920]   And they give up a little bit other processed food
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.280]   and they come over and they start having problems
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.760]   because they're not actually consuming enough salt.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.760]   So add that back.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.020]   Easy way to do that.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:29.920]   You can use electrolytes
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.440]   and we could talk about those numbers if you want.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.660]   If you just salt your food that you're making to taste,
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.360]   that's gonna get most people in a pretty good spot.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:43.360]   So start hydrated, consume hydrating foods.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.560]   Step number two.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.160]   Step number three, you wanna pre-hydrate.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.600]   If you know you're gonna do a workout session
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.920]   and it's gonna be hot and long or one of those things,
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.880]   you wanna look for that half a pound
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.120]   per body weight of ounces.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.500]   So that's the number we're looking for
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.000]   to start our hydration session.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.080]   We do that, we're pretty much taken care of.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:02.920]   And then, like I said,
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.920]   adjust depending on lifestyle, humidity
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.920]   and other factors like that.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:11.720]   You can use what is called the WUT system, W-U-T.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.680]   I think Bob Kenefic has done a ton of research in this area.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.400]   If you wanna read more, look up his research.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.920]   It is simply weight, urine and thirst.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.080]   So in other words, check your body weight,
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.660]   look at your urine color and gauge your thirst.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.420]   And actually you can use those three things
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.720]   and those can significantly predict actual hydration status
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.480]   independent of actually measuring osmolology
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.320]   or anything like that.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:39.640]   So those three metrics alone are pretty good indicator
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.600]   of where you're at.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.860]   So you're gonna have that normal amount of water
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:46.660]   plus or minus, if you miss that number for whatever reason,
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.080]   you get distracted.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.560]   The number we typically tell people is like something like
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.360]   400 to 500 milliliters of water
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.500]   in the hour proceeding the training, all right?
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:59.160]   So that's like 13 to 20 ounces.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.960]   So like, you know you're gonna go work out at three o'clock,
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.560]   it's two o'clock and you realize,
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:06.280]   oh man, I have not drank much water today.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.600]   You don't need to go smash tons and tons and tons.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.700]   Just look for something like that, you know,
[01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:13.200]   call it a bottle of water, if you will.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.460]   If that's not enough, if you're in a really tough spot,
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:19.460]   you can do more like five to eight ounces,
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:23.080]   15 or 20 minutes before exercise.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.480]   You wanna be really careful about drinking a bunch of water
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.760]   like in the seconds before exercise,
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.460]   because you're just gonna feel a whole bunch of water
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:32.580]   bouncing up and down in your stomach and nobody likes that.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:37.400]   So one to 300 milliliters, 15 or so 20 minutes before.
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:42.120]   That assumes you're in this like 185 pound range ish.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.680]   Again, if you're talking people of much larger size,
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:48.120]   you may need to increase those values accordingly.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:51.620]   If you do all that, then you use the Galpin equation
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:54.200]   for your intra workout hydration
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.220]   and you're in a pretty good spot.
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:59.720]   What you want to consume in that is what I call sweat.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.220]   What I mean by that is you don't actually
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:06.620]   wanna necessarily consume water only during a workout.
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:11.620]   You wanna consume something that is isosmotic to your blood.
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:14.840]   So something that is the same concentration
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.280]   that you've lost in your sweat.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.080]   So if you've done a sweat test,
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:23.080]   you would then drink a fluid that is of the same osmolality.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.180]   The short version of that,
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:29.860]   something in the neighborhood of 200 to 400 milligrams
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:33.220]   of sodium, most electrolytes products
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.060]   are gonna be something like that.
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:37.840]   Now I know element is 1,000 milligrams and it's a lot higher,
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.860]   but most products now that you're gonna find
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:42.200]   are 250 to 400 milligrams.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.780]   And they're typically in the like two to maybe up to three
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:49.020]   to one sodium to potassium range, right?
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.700]   Coconut water is actually cool.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.720]   It's like basically the opposite.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.500]   Like a cup of coconut water, I think has something
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.540]   like 200 milligrams of sodium,
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.920]   but like 600 milligrams of potassium.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:00.860]   So like total spoiler alert,
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:03.500]   but when we use coconut water, a lot of hydration,
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.040]   just add a little pinch of salt
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.020]   'cause that'll bring the sodium way back up.
[01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.100]   - Yeah, one note about sodium,
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:12.220]   obviously people who have pre-hypertension or hypertension
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.320]   wanna be careful with their sodium intake.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.500]   In time I've suggested that people might consider
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.780]   ingesting more sodium, you know, it's sort of,
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.300]   it's like putting a target on your back.
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:25.020]   And yet the data are pretty good showing that
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:28.180]   if people are not getting enough sodium,
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:31.820]   their mental clarity, their focus, their mental stamina,
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:34.440]   their physical stamina really suffers.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.000]   And then people argue, well,
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.180]   most of us are getting too much salt.
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.180]   That often is true for people
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:41.980]   that are eating a lot of processed foods.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:42.900]   - And not training.
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:43.980]   - And not training.
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:48.400]   But for many people who are already sort of health conscious
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.580]   who are training, they're largely consuming,
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.820]   or I should say they're consuming largely non-processed
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.220]   or minimally processed foods.
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:59.300]   And especially for folks who are not ingesting
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:03.140]   many carbohydrates and are consuming caffeine,
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.760]   a lot of people don't know that carbohydrates hold water
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.220]   and that makes it sound bad.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:09.820]   It's not necessarily that you're gonna get
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:12.060]   subcutaneous swelling of your body.
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:13.380]   - Now it's recovering.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:15.700]   - It's bringing water into your system and it holds water.
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.380]   So when you drop carbohydrates, starches in particular,
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:19.500]   you urinate a lot more.
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:23.820]   And when you drink caffeine, you also urinate a lot more,
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:25.100]   as you pointed out earlier.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.860]   So you start combining a few things
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:29.580]   like slightly lower carbohydrate or low carbohydrate,
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.700]   eating really quote unquote clean.
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.460]   You're not getting a lot of salt in your food
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:36.060]   and drinking caffeine and then exercising.
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.580]   And then pretty soon, those numbers that come along
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:41.900]   with a gram of sodium in your electrolyte drink
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:43.460]   are not all that outrageous.
[01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:46.020]   And what you find is people feel much, much better
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:48.140]   when they're getting enough sodium.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:51.800]   And of course, I should say that there's no reason
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.580]   why someone has to ingest a supplement like Element
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.100]   or something, there are plenty of other ways
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.420]   to bring sodium into your system.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:00.340]   You can use a pinch of pink salt or Himalayan salt
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:03.460]   or sea salt or even just table salt in water,
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:06.040]   or just making sure that you're salting your food enough.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.100]   And I think that there too, salt appetite
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.820]   and salt taste is a pretty good guide.
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:14.100]   If you taste something and it tastes really salty to you,
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.260]   that's an indication that either it's really salty
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:19.860]   or your salt stores are kind of tapped off, you're okay.
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:22.580]   Whereas if you're craving salt and you're thinking,
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:26.740]   gosh, I really want to put salt on this already salty thing.
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:28.900]   Not necessarily, but oftentimes that means
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:30.340]   that you are salt deficient.
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.800]   So salt appetite is a pretty hardwired set
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.060]   of neural circuits and hormones.
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:37.100]   And I think we would all be wise to learn to tap into the,
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.780]   our kind of intuition about salt intake,
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:41.000]   but of course also to measure your blood pressure, et cetera.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.220]   - Yeah, of course, if you think you have some sort
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.060]   of contraindication there that work with a medical specialist
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:49.460]   without question, those situations you laid out though,
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:50.300]   were very real.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:51.140]   A lot of people are living like that.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.900]   And so it's important for those folks to understand
[01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.140]   if you are going through symptoms, fatigue,
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:10:00.240]   lack of focus, cognitive function, performance isn't there,
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.340]   then hey, like you may be under salted.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:07.300]   And again, actually a good amount of blood chemistry work
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:08.620]   can unravel that a lot.
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:11.020]   And it can sort of tell you if you're running out of whack.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:14.780]   There are a number of folks who are extremely sensitive
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:16.420]   to sodium in terms of health risk.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:17.820]   And that is a real thing.
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:21.060]   Again, work with your individual folks on that.
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.940]   I don't work with anyone for disease treatment
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:23.840]   or management at all.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.660]   I've said that probably four times,
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.660]   I'll say it six more times.
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:28.900]   I only take people who are healthy
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:31.160]   and try to make them perform at their best possible level.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.900]   So it's actually funny you mentioned that
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.040]   because I was going to give people my recommendation
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.960]   for sodium intake in general throughout the day.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.460]   And then I decided, I'm not going to say that
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:40.420]   'cause all it's going to do is make all the rest
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:41.860]   of the people who aren't coming to come after me
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:44.060]   for the watermelon comment, come after me for that.
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:44.900]   So I'll say that.
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:45.740]   - By the end of today's episode,
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.600]   the goal is that everyone's coming after you,
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.500]   but also that everyone has learned something of value.
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:54.020]   You've already given us a tremendous insights
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:58.500]   and actionable information on creatine and hydration.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.740]   And along those lines,
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.420]   I'd love for you to tell us about some of the things
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.180]   that we can do with supplementation
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.540]   in order to enhance training
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.860]   by taking certain things before we train.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:14.460]   And I also have the question of how long before training
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:17.180]   should we start thinking about supplying nutrients
[01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:20.020]   and supplements for the training session?
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.540]   - I'm not sure I actually finished my fiber.
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.320]   Maybe I wasn't clear enough about the last one.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.760]   So I just want to tie that bow
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.020]   and then we'll go to the next one.
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.260]   Yeah, no, it was probably my fault.
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:31.620]   So that, in addition to the Galpin equation
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:36.620]   in terms of amount, I recommend it at roughly three to one,
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.060]   sodium to potassium recommendation.
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.380]   And I gave you some rough numbers for things like that.
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.060]   I actually, in all honesty,
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:46.740]   use probably six to 10 different electrolyte companies,
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.880]   depending on the situation.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.380]   Some of them are really good.
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:50.820]   In the case, again, like element,
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.700]   that's nice about that is there's no carbohydrate.
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:54.920]   However, the downside is there's no carbohydrate.
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:57.780]   So sometimes I want carbohydrates in the training,
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:00.440]   'cause as you mentioned, there's significant evidence,
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.600]   going back actually several decades,
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:06.500]   on the benefit of carbohydrate during exercise.
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.300]   So if you're in a situation where you're trying to,
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:12.220]   again, maximize actual exercise performance,
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.400]   especially if it is either a long duration,
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.100]   so more than two hours, or extremely high intensity,
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.340]   and this has to be well north of 100% of your VO2 max.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.260]   In that situation,
[01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:24.500]   as we talked about in the endurance episode,
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.660]   you can actually start having a decrement in performance
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:28.900]   because of a drop of muscle glycogen,
[01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:31.300]   liver glycogen can start coming down.
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.620]   If that's the case,
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:34.900]   augmenting with the carbohydrates during the training,
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.300]   that is going to enhance performance.
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:39.020]   It's gonna do what we call spare the liver,
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:42.540]   and it's gonna keep, my second rule of my four,
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.040]   which is maintain glucose ingestion,
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.560]   is gonna keep that going.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.400]   In general, what you're gonna find is,
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.360]   the number is like a five to 9% glucose concentration
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.200]   in your fluid,
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.960]   which turns out to be like exactly the number
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.740]   that most sports drinks have,
[01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.340]   as well as I think that's pretty much exactly
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.320]   what coconut water is.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.400]   The downside of sports drinks, since we're here,
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.640]   is they actually tend to be undersalted,
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.700]   and so that they don't provide enough of them.
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:07.760]   If you look at the numbers,
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:10.800]   they're gonna say something like 60 to 100 grams
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.680]   of carbohydrate per hour, is the target.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.740]   And now if you're using the sort of,
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:16.580]   galloping equation,
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:19.280]   and you're splitting that up into 15 minute intervals,
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:23.240]   it's something again like 20 or so grams of carbs,
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.360]   per 15 to 20 minutes.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:28.740]   If you're doing again, an hour long plus training valve.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.340]   So admittedly, 100 grams is a bit much for some folks,
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.280]   depending on your size.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:37.180]   So I would recommend starting in that 60 gram or so range,
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.800]   again, per hour total is what you wanna get to.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.780]   And only in the situation in which,
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:45.160]   muscle glycogen depletion is becoming a limiting factor
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.000]   to performance.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.760]   So the other benefit of that is, as you mentioned,
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:52.640]   that actually drives water into the cell.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.480]   And so you're gonna be in that nice sweet spot of,
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.360]   you're actually keeping glucose going,
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.520]   which is gonna enhance performance,
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.360]   and you're helping hydration at the same time.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.320]   So the other little part that's important
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.200]   to pay attention to here is,
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.600]   the type of carbohydrate matters.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.200]   So you can use actually a whole combination
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.700]   of things called resistant starches,
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:13.280]   which I will use for a long bouts of exercise,
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.520]   but in the middle of the workout,
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.040]   you're going to want to focus on glucose and fructose,
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.360]   mostly glucose.
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.760]   Typically at least a two or three to one ratio
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.800]   of glucose to fructose.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.040]   And the reason is those actually get into tissue
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.140]   through separate transporters.
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.440]   And so what happens is once the glucose transporters
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.040]   get full, you can't bring anything else in.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.800]   However, since fructose comes in a separate route,
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.400]   you can maximize total carbohydrate intake
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.840]   by using two different unique forms.
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.200]   There's a lot of ways you can do this,
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.200]   but this is where the momentous fuel product
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:48.720]   is like specifically has that exactly in it.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.460]   So it's fantastic.
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:52.700]   You can use food, no problem.
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:54.960]   You can use a combination of things like honey
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:58.400]   and different easily absorbable and usable
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:01.580]   and things that you can actually like maybe put in a drink
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:02.420]   to get away with.
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:03.840]   So there's lots of routes for it,
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.440]   but you want to look in that sort of combination
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:09.680]   of five to 9%, roughly glucose for there.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:12.040]   So you do need to train your gut.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.040]   So do not do anything.
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.440]   And there's a generally a good rule.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.680]   Do not do anything in your competition
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.480]   that you've never done in practice.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.360]   So try these food items, try these amounts,
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:26.420]   the carbohydrate numbers, try the sodium numbers,
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:28.440]   try the total amount of water.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.000]   Start low, you can always increase.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.760]   What you don't want to do is have to run out
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.380]   during the middle of your spin class
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:37.040]   and sprint to the bathroom and hope nobody's in your way,
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.060]   which in the lab we've seen, we'll just say accidents
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:42.300]   like that occur more than once.
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:44.760]   So just be careful of your stomach.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.160]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.740]   to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:51.060]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:53.720]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.320]   to help you better understand your body
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.200]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.680]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.080]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.920]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.060]   and wellbeing can only be analyzed
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:07.260]   from a quality blood test.
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:09.240]   One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.380]   out there, however, is that you get information back
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.320]   about various levels of lipids and hormones
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.220]   and metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:17.200]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.760]   InsideTracker makes knowing what to do
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:21.360]   with all that information exceedingly easy.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.100]   They have a personalized platform that lets you see
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:25.880]   what your specific numbers are, of course,
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:29.320]   but then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts,
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.800]   what sorts of nutritional changes,
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.900]   what sorts of supplementation would allow you
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.640]   to bring those levels into the ranges
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.160]   that are optimal for you.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.520]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.180]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:42.720]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.360]   I realized I jumped the gun a little bit
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.480]   asking about supplementation for before,
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.120]   during, and after a workout,
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.740]   because what I neglected to ask about
[01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:56.220]   was training in the fasted state.
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:58.420]   This is something that we talked about in an earlier episode,
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.360]   but I think it's worth highlighting now.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:03.320]   Sometimes the best way to supplement, if you will,
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:07.020]   a workout or pre-workout is ingesting nothing.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.140]   I'm one of these people.
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:10.200]   I actually prefer to do my weight training
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:13.220]   somewhere between seven and eight a.m. each morning,
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.080]   sometimes a little earlier, sometimes a little bit later.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:20.160]   I drink fluids, water, and I do ingest caffeine
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.940]   prior to those training days.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.820]   On days when I don't train, I do,
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:27.640]   as I often recommend people do,
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.260]   delay my caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking.
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:34.840]   But in any event, it's water and caffeine,
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.400]   yerba mate or coffee or some sort of stimulant
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.400]   for weight training workouts,
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:42.120]   and generally not for cardiovascular training workouts,
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.540]   although sometimes yes.
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:44.600]   So I'm training fasted.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.920]   That said, I'm ingesting carbohydrate the night before
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:51.080]   to make sure that I have glycogen stores that are topped off
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.760]   and so it's fasted, but with that caveat.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:57.160]   What are your thoughts on training fasted?
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:00.880]   And what I just described is fasted overnight,
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.520]   but some people are training in the afternoon
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:06.400]   and they may opt to not eat anything
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:10.320]   in the two to four hours prior to training
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.720]   or maybe even longer.
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:15.560]   I personally find that caffeine hits my system a lot better
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.660]   when I'm fasted.
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:19.240]   Better meaning it just seems to have more of a potent effect.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.520]   There are some reasons for that.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.960]   And of course we dissuade people from ingesting caffeine
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.620]   too late in the day 'cause it'll disrupt sleep.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:29.580]   So I'm not saying fast for three hours then drink caffeine,
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.740]   but who knows, maybe that's in your protocol.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.920]   The simple version of this question is,
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:37.060]   what are your thoughts on training fasted?
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:39.240]   And if people are going to train fasted,
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:43.380]   how should they modulate their fluid intake if at all?
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:44.700]   - What happens with exercise?
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.440]   In the endurance and metabolism episode,
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.940]   we walk through and the fact that no matter
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:52.020]   what you're using for fuel, carbohydrates or fat,
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:54.900]   or even other potential sources,
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:59.900]   the end product of all of those is ATP, CO2 and water, right?
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.620]   So you're trying to make ATP.
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.200]   That is the fuel for exercise.
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:06.480]   Now, ATP is adenosine triphosphate.
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:09.080]   So one, two, three phosphates on top of an adenosine.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:11.480]   Well, what you may have not put together
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:15.760]   is if you hydrolyze ATP
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.200]   and you break off one of those phosphates,
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   you now have ADP.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:22.600]   If you do it again, you have AMP, adenosine monophosphate.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:26.280]   If you do it one more time, now you just have adenosine.
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.240]   And if you have then,
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.840]   therefore run through a lot of exercise,
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.020]   burned a lot of energy,
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:33.840]   you have increased the amount of adenosine
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.540]   that's floating around.
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:38.720]   Now, if you have a high concentration of adenosine,
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.360]   what's that gonna make you want to do?
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.720]   That's gonna bind to certain receptors.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:45.640]   And we know when those receptors get bound to, you fall?
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.480]   - Asleep.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.320]   - Bingo.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.800]   Caffeine will competitively bind to those receptors.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:53.880]   Therefore, that's why caffeine stops you
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.100]   from feeling like you wanna go to sleep, right?
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:20:00.140]   So we have a very clear relationship between exercise, fuel.
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.740]   In fact, if you look at the literature,
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:03.020]   there's a pretty clear relationship
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:06.760]   between the more caloric expenditure in different sports
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:10.140]   and the higher amount of hours needed for sleep.
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:13.220]   So there's a nice tie between how hard you're exercising,
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:14.160]   how much energy you're burning,
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.220]   how much you need to sleep, stimulants,
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:17.340]   which brings us all the way back
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:19.580]   to your question of fueling.
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:22.100]   So do I need to fuel prior to my exercise bout?
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:23.500]   If you're going to be limited
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:28.500]   in your exercise bout by fuel, then fueling is necessary,
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.220]   one way or the other.
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:32.100]   If it is a type of training that is not,
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.700]   then it's not going to matter.
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:36.780]   And so the examples we gave, if you're doing,
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:40.780]   if you're gonna go do a 30-second bout of maximal exertion
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:42.380]   and you're gonna do it one time,
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.980]   you don't need to worry about fueling at all.
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:47.380]   - We're eating within your workout
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:48.340]   'cause it's only 30 seconds.
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.580]   - Yeah, 30 seconds.
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:52.080]   You don't need to worry about hydration post-exercise.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.300]   You don't need to worry about recovery.
[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:55.580]   Total energy expenditure was nothing.
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:58.940]   If you're gonna go, you know, you're gonna go practice,
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:00.420]   you're gonna go to the driving range
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.980]   and practice your golf swing,
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:03.060]   you don't need to worry about it.
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.340]   The total amount of energy expenditure is just not high.
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:08.060]   In fact, in that case, you might wanna keep it somewhat low
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:10.220]   because you wanna keep blood glucose fairly even
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:11.340]   and you don't wanna bring it into the system.
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:13.340]   You certainly wouldn't wanna use stimulants, right?
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:16.040]   'Cause you may get over exerted inside.
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.020]   In all of these things,
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:18.100]   we probably should have started off
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.020]   our conversation with this.
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:23.500]   In terms of macronutrients, the total amount
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:27.140]   throughout the day is more important generally
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:31.160]   than the timing of them, which is why you can do things
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.360]   like have a bunch of carbohydrate at night,
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:37.140]   not eat the next morning and lift and be just fine.
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:38.620]   It doesn't matter that you didn't have them
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:41.260]   in a few hours before, your muscle glycogen is topped off,
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.300]   your liver is glycogen is topped off,
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:45.420]   you're absolutely fine, you have plenty of fuel.
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:46.780]   Even if you were to wait a few more hours.
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:48.940]   In fact, even if you were to do conditioning,
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.180]   you're probably fine.
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:51.980]   I have plenty of athletes that prefer
[01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:55.000]   to do many of their training sessions faster than morning
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.220]   for personal reasons, not because it enhances performance,
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:01.620]   but if it doesn't enhance or harm it then,
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:04.000]   and it's a personal preference thing, fine.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.500]   If you're gonna go do a session though,
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.180]   where you're going to be really concerned
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:08.340]   with muscle glycogen depletion,
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.640]   and again, you can go back to that episode
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:13.340]   to learn different types, when those thresholds hits
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:14.540]   and what you're worried about,
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:15.700]   then the feeling would be important.
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.860]   You would either need to have something before the session
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:20.020]   or consume it during the session.
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:21.740]   So one of the other things we'd like to say here
[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:26.740]   is recovery starts during the previous workout, right?
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:28.920]   So if you're working out right now
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.180]   and you optimize nutrition right now,
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.420]   even if you don't necessarily need it
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:35.820]   for the current workout, if you can get ahead on recovery,
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:37.940]   then you're gonna be fine the next day.
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:40.540]   And the differentiation here between carbohydrate
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:41.980]   and protein is important.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:44.420]   So the total amount of protein you ingest
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:46.320]   throughout the day is probably a bigger determinant
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.700]   for things like muscle growth than the timing.
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:51.140]   So the post-exercise anabolic window,
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:52.840]   it doesn't necessarily matter.
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:54.580]   Carbohydrate is different.
[01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:56.060]   The timing of that does matter.
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:58.800]   It needs to be around and available
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.460]   so you can maximize both hydration
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.780]   and muscle glycogen resynthesis,
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.420]   which is restoring the muscle glycogen
[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.500]   you burn during exercise.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.100]   I also work with athletes that train multiple times a day.
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:12.140]   So in those particular cases,
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:14.620]   a recovery window is half what you normally have.
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:17.280]   So if you're in a situation where you have two or three days
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.500]   before you work out again,
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:20.440]   you don't need to worry about getting carbohydrate
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.980]   in before, during or after,
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:23.840]   because by the time you go to train again,
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:26.500]   you will have restored your muscle glycogen levels easily.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.880]   However, if you're training every day or twice in a day,
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.700]   then the timing of carbohydrate really starts to matter.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:35.600]   And in that case, I see no reason to not ingest
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.040]   those nutrients either before, during or after.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:41.400]   You don't need to necessarily do it, but you can.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:45.060]   The general rule of thumb I give is something like this.
[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:47.240]   If you're doing something where you're trying
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:50.280]   to really work hard, whether this is hypertrophy training
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:51.920]   or a lot of endurance,
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.880]   energy expenditure is gonna be high,
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.320]   potential muscle damage is high
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:59.200]   and/or energy utilization is high.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.840]   What you wanna look for is a number,
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:05.840]   something in the area of like half a gram of carbohydrate
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.800]   per pound of body weight.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:11.060]   So you weigh 200 pounds.
[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:14.820]   You wanna make sure that either pre, mid or post or total,
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:17.180]   you bring in 100 grams of carbohydrate.
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:19.200]   It's just a very rough number to start.
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.740]   Protein is about half of that.
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:24.780]   So it's about a quarter of your body weight, right?
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:27.380]   So those numbers would be if you're 200 pounds,
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:28.900]   make sure you have 100 grams of carbs
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:30.600]   and 50 grams of protein.
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:32.780]   And again, it doesn't necessarily have to be before
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:36.340]   or during or after and you'll be in a good spot.
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:41.340]   All you need to do then is alter, what I do I should say,
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:44.340]   is alter the amount of carbohydrate
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.780]   based on energy expenditure.
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:49.420]   So a lower energy and easier workout,
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:51.300]   instead of having 100 grams of carbs,
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:54.100]   I might tack that down to 75 or even 50
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:57.320]   and be at a one to one carb protein ratio.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.560]   If it was even harder, more sun, hotter outside,
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.060]   more fluid loss, I might go from 100 grams of carbs
[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:08.620]   up to 150 or 200 and get closer to like a three to one
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:10.940]   or four to one carbohydrate protein ratio.
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:14.140]   So those are the numbers that I generally go by.
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:18.060]   - Well, as I take a sip of my double espresso Americano
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:21.260]   here, I'd love for you to tell us about stimulants.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:24.980]   - Sure, there's no shortage of these in most of our lives.
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:28.580]   And of course you can cover the health benefits of it later.
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:29.540]   Maybe you have an episode.
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:31.300]   - Yes, we have an episode on caffeine
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:32.760]   and it does have certain health benefits,
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:35.320]   although one has to use caffeine correctly
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.760]   in order to drive those.
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.520]   - So there's, caffeine is the easy one to start with
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.660]   and we won't belabor the point here.
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:42.880]   The evidence is strong.
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.380]   It has an ergogenic effect.
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:48.680]   You can take it at whatever dosage is reasonable for you.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:52.160]   And of course there is a bit of a learning curve there
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.320]   such that obviously the more you take it,
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.240]   the more you need to take,
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.940]   even though there's actually some recent evidence showing
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:00.000]   even folks who are acclimated to it
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.480]   will still see an ergogenic benefit,
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.500]   even though if they don't feel a big boost of it.
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:07.580]   So typically that takes 30 to 45 minutes or so,
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:09.420]   but it's highly dependent upon the person.
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:13.000]   So some people can smell coffee and immediately feel better.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.260]   And that's probably working actually
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:17.240]   through a different mechanism of anticipation,
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.600]   but you can take it there.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.360]   The half-life of it is four to six hours
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:22.200]   or something like that.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:23.400]   It can totally depends on the person.
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:25.480]   So don't let it ruin your sleep.
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.180]   But if you take it prior to performance,
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:31.620]   it has a noticeable effect on particularly endurance.
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:35.160]   A maximum strength, maybe less, quite clearly less so.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.060]   In fact, the data are mixed there
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:39.520]   on whether it actually does anything for peak strength.
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.680]   Although I think most people would suggest that,
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.500]   you're going to take it prior to trying to truly lift
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:50.500]   as high as trying to lift a one repetition max or similar.
[01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.620]   But most of the documented effects
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:55.260]   are on the endurance-based activities.
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:57.980]   - Yes, so my read of the literature
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:00.580]   in terms of performance-enhancing effects of caffeine
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:05.320]   are that one to three milligrams,
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.180]   I want to make sure that people hear the units correctly
[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.580]   before people blitz themselves out with that caffeine,
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:13.220]   one to three milligrams per kilogram of body weight
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:17.060]   about 30 minutes prior to exercise
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:19.220]   has a definite performance-enhancing effect.
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:22.820]   It also has a definite mental performance-enhancing effect,
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:26.140]   especially when people who are regular caffeine users
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:28.180]   have abstained from caffeine
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:31.460]   for anywhere from two to 15 days.
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.960]   And that's an extremely rare circumstance.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.620]   But even if they have not,
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:37.840]   it appears that one to three milligrams per kilogram
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.480]   of body weight of caffeine taken about,
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:44.380]   again, it's not super precise as far as I can see,
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:47.020]   about 30 minutes before the event starts
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:51.740]   can really enhance reaction time and power output.
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:54.980]   And as well as, as you mentioned, endurance.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:56.900]   When I was researching the caffeine episode,
[01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:59.340]   one interesting caveat that I discovered
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:02.620]   was that if people are not caffeine-adapted,
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:05.260]   they are not regular users of caffeine,
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:07.180]   the sudden introduction of caffeine
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:10.580]   can really degrade performance,
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:12.740]   mostly because people don't know how to operate
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:14.780]   at that high level of autonomic arousal.
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:15.820]   Have you ever observed that?
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:16.740]   - Yeah, 100%.
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:17.980]   In fact, there's actually data going up
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:20.620]   as high as 10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight,
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:22.820]   which is, in fact, once you cross
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:25.980]   the five milligram per kilogram threshold,
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:28.060]   you will start seeing performance decrements.
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:30.500]   So there's absolutely such a thing
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:33.380]   of ruining your performance with too much caffeine.
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:36.180]   So most people listening to this, if you're thinking,
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:38.140]   wow, they said caffeine, I'm all in,
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:39.620]   and then you just stop listening,
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:43.020]   and now you go for your quad espresso shot
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:45.400]   before every time you go to work out,
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.100]   you probably are passing that threshold.
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:48.340]   If you think about those numbers,
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:51.340]   one to three milligrams per kilogram body weight,
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:54.660]   if you weigh 100 kilograms, that's 220 pounds,
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:57.500]   that'd be something like two to 500 milligrams of caffeine,
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.900]   which is like a pretty high amount,
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:02.780]   but a coffee is gonna get you close,
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:04.900]   and espresso is gonna get you somewhat in that ballpark,
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:06.940]   depending on source and stuff.
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:08.400]   So you don't really need to go
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.220]   and blister your brain with caffeine.
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.820]   In fact, if you do, it's quite common,
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:14.060]   and in fact, likely,
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:16.220]   that you'll actually make performance worse.
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:17.060]   - Right.
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:20.900]   - Yeah, the amount of caffeine in different coffees
[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.580]   and sodas, et cetera, of course, varies.
[01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.460]   One thing that people ought to know is that
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:29.580]   the smallest of commercially available coffees
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.980]   at the most popular commercial vendors
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:37.020]   generally contain anywhere from 250
[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:39.980]   to 350 milligrams of caffeine.
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:43.300]   What that means is that the so-called medium and the large
[01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:47.320]   contain as much as 500 milligrams or one gram of caffeine.
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:50.460]   So for you morning large coffee
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:53.660]   at a commercial vendor, drinkers,
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:56.040]   if you're wondering why you get a headache
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:58.660]   if you're 30 minutes late on that caffeine,
[01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:02.920]   or if you can't access that caffeine at all,
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.340]   or even if you're drinking coffee, excuse me,
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:06.980]   from another source, and you're finding like,
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:08.240]   oh, it's really not doing it for me,
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.240]   it's because the amount of caffeine
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:15.200]   in the now commercially sold coffees is exceedingly high.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.920]   It's about two or three times higher
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.520]   than the standard lookup tables
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:19.520]   that you'll see on the internet.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.120]   So I'm not saying that to demonize caffeine,
[01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:23.940]   we can pretty quickly adapt to
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:25.880]   and form a tolerance to caffeine.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:27.800]   Some people never really can get over the jitters.
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:30.760]   Other people are just fine
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:32.920]   with even a thousand milligrams of caffeine,
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.280]   but only because they've been drinking
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:35.920]   a lot of caffeine consistently.
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:36.760]   Anyway.
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.880]   - It's also wildly inconsistent from location to location.
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.440]   The brew type, the functionality.
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.800]   So yeah, that stuff can be very hard
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.200]   to figure out what's happening.
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.940]   - There's only one way, really,
[01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:49.220]   to objectively measure caffeine,
[01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:50.960]   and that's to use caffeine tablets.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:51.880]   And they work pretty well.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:55.160]   Actually, someone I know who's prominent
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:59.320]   in the podcast space uses 100 to 200 milligrams
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.520]   of caffeine in tablet form, combined with tea.
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.660]   So they've now conditioned themselves
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:06.040]   to think that herbal tea actually
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.040]   has this caffeinating effect.
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.540]   But tablet form caffeine,
[01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:13.400]   while I'm not recommending it to outright,
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:15.340]   it is going to give you the best sense
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:17.280]   of how much caffeine you can tolerate
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:18.720]   and how much is performance enhancing
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.200]   or is performance degrading.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:23.400]   - There's actually another line of supplementation
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:24.240]   that we can go down here,
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.160]   which is not technically a stimulant,
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.920]   but it's something I use to help performance
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:31.520]   when you don't want caffeine.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:33.040]   And so this thing specifically,
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.380]   if you're one of those folks who have to exercise at night,
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:39.660]   and you want a little bit of boost for your training,
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.880]   but you don't want to have caffeine
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.400]   'cause it messes up your sleep.
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.840]   And this is when you can turn to the whole like citrulline,
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.340]   arginine, nitric oxide sort of route.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.400]   And we'll skip the explanation there,
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:52.340]   but effectively what happens is nitric oxide
[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:55.600]   is this wonderful compound that causes vasodilation.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.240]   And of course, that's going to aid then
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:01.300]   in transporting nutrients in and out of the cell.
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:03.480]   So it has an ergogenic effect.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.200]   You have a number of ways you can go about this.
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:09.380]   Some of them have more pros and cons than others.
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:11.540]   And there are more and more data coming out
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:14.680]   specifically on citrulline and more recently.
[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:16.600]   If you look though, in my opinion,
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.400]   the most consistent evidence
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:20.760]   for the most consistent effect
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.380]   is in the supplement of beetroot or beetroot juice
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:24.780]   or extract or something like that.
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:26.620]   So you can find those supplements
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:29.240]   and they tend to, again, they're pretty effective
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.140]   at enhancing performance,
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:32.260]   specifically anything moderate
[01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:34.120]   to longer duration endurance performance.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.880]   And they are not a stimulant.
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:38.480]   So they won't ruin your sleep that much.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:41.520]   - One note of caution for those of you
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.900]   that are interested in citrulline or beetroot,
[01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:45.600]   because they are in the arginine pathway,
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:49.500]   if you're somebody who has a predisposition to cold sores,
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:53.400]   oral cold sores that is, or other forms of cold sores,
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:56.600]   that because activation of the arginine pathway
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:33:00.360]   can exacerbate some of the neural related aspects
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.760]   of cold sores, and that's because the viruses
[01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:05.460]   that cause those cold sores actually live on neurons,
[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:07.480]   then you want to be very cautious with citrulline,
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:09.060]   especially high dose citrulline.
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:12.780]   I can really amplify the cold sore response.
[01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:17.780]   What about non-stimulant yet focus enhancing supplements?
[01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:23.600]   Things like alpha GPC, for example,
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:27.760]   I routinely use 300 to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:31.640]   prior to hard physical training, typically weight training.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:35.240]   But occasionally I'll take 300 milligrams of alpha GPC
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:39.580]   prior to a mental workout, less often these days,
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:42.900]   'cause I kind of reserve it for physical training,
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:45.860]   and I don't tend to use it every day,
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:49.480]   maybe once every third or fourth workout,
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:50.480]   combined with caffeine.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:53.380]   So that combination is pretty potent, I find.
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:56.540]   And so technically, because it's a cholinergic agonist,
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:59.620]   it's not a stimulant in the traditional sense,
[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:03.500]   but it has a focusing and an alertness promoting
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:04.620]   aspect to it.
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:06.780]   - What are your thoughts on those sorts of compounds?
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:11.020]   - There's not much human exercise performance data on those.
[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:15.420]   There are certainly cognitive functioning tests on those.
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:17.140]   So you're not going to find a lot of information.
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:19.080]   No, but there isn't none.
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:22.300]   We actually will use many of these substances.
[01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:24.500]   You could globally call them nootropics,
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:28.140]   which is any substance that specifically
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:29.320]   will enhance brain function,
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.460]   is a rough way to think about it.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:35.540]   We'll use them prior to more challenging bouts of training.
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:36.860]   This is something that we'll pull out,
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:39.000]   say on the sparring day only,
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.340]   or the most important training session,
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:43.340]   or a session when you're trying to work on pitch command,
[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:45.820]   or when you're trying to enhance work on your shot,
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:46.980]   and as a basketball player,
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:49.120]   or you're really trying to improve a certain swing
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.680]   as a golfer or something like that.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:52.220]   But we do not use them every day.
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:53.380]   We do not use them with every person.
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:55.260]   So yeah, we will use those.
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:56.100]   They are not stimulants,
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:57.860]   but they can be performance enhancing.
[01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:00.560]   And another kind of way to think about this is,
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:04.120]   if you're in the case of caloric restriction,
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.060]   so whether you're trying to lose weight,
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:07.380]   or we're actually trying to control weight
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:10.880]   for weight purposes in terms of a sports
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.100]   where you have to be in a certain weight class
[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:13.900]   or something like that,
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:15.680]   well, we may not be able to give you food.
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:17.620]   In fact, we may not be able to give you stimulants
[01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:18.580]   because of the sleep thing,
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:21.280]   or because we're already like maxed on our stimulants.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.440]   Now we can go this route.
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.480]   And so you at least like mentally,
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:25.320]   you're a little bit there,
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.060]   and you're more likely to be alert and focused,
[01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:29.500]   and you can train harder despite the fact
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:30.660]   that we didn't actually change fuel.
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:33.200]   Now that's a little bit of a short game
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.660]   in terms of that's not your permanent solution.
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:37.080]   You eventually need to bring calories up
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:39.940]   or whatever other training you're training
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:40.780]   or whatever you're going to do,
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:43.740]   but it can work in a nice short pinch.
[01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:45.360]   - I'm very interested to learn from you
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:47.260]   about fatigue reducers.
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:49.300]   And I'm hoping that Rodeo la Rosea
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:51.260]   will come up in the conversation.
[01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.100]   - Yeah, great.
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:53.400]   Let's just start right there then.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.780]   There's actually a lot of research on this
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:59.620]   despite most people not having heard of it.
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:01.460]   I think I mentioned in a previous episode,
[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:03.640]   I've used it a lot over many, many years.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:06.600]   You have to be a little bit careful of it.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:08.140]   There's, well, first of all,
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:10.660]   no, we should have said this at the onset,
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:12.660]   no supplement is a panacea, right?
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:13.660]   Nothing's going to work for everything.
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:15.060]   And Rodeo is no different.
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:16.620]   It can have a number of effects.
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:18.300]   If you look across the literature,
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:19.540]   you're going to find generally somewhere
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:22.980]   between a small benefit to little benefit,
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:26.880]   but not often is it detrimental with a few exceptions.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.320]   I know of a handful of papers
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:30.580]   that would be two specifically,
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:33.940]   where it may actually reduce muscular endurance.
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:35.300]   Okay, fine.
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:37.580]   If you think about what's happening is
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:41.500]   one of the benefits that has been seen so far with Rodeo la
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:44.580]   is helpful at managing cortisol.
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:48.140]   But cortisol suppression is not necessarily a good thing.
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:51.320]   We talked about how if you do an acute bout of stress,
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.680]   cortisol will go way up.
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:54.540]   And that is a sign of acute stress.
[01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:58.480]   However, a sign of long-term excessive stress
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.260]   is cortisol suppression.
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:02.780]   And so this is a thing to be really careful of
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:05.880]   is if you're feeling down or lethargic or tired,
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.400]   and you think your adrenals are messed up,
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.380]   and then you start taking cortisol modulators,
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:11.380]   you could be making the problem worse,
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:14.260]   because now your cortisol is actually suppressed.
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:15.900]   And now you're taking these things to blunt it
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:17.020]   or keep it low.
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:20.220]   And you continue to feel lethargic and lack of desire
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:22.100]   and libido and focus and sort of all these things.
[01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:24.300]   So cortisol is not a bad thing.
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:26.280]   We want this to be going up and down
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:29.000]   in the amounts that we want.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.840]   So if we're thinking about like, for example, waking up,
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.240]   you would want generally something like a 50% reduction
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:37.940]   in the first hour in terms of cortisol concentrations.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:40.920]   However, if you're extremely suppressed already,
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:42.600]   going down is only gonna be a problem.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:47.600]   So Rodeo la has a good evidence base to support it for that.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.620]   You'll see actually a number of studies
[01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:53.440]   that have looked at it in a whole host of areas for benefit.
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.320]   So something good to do.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:58.120]   The difficult part with Rodeo la, to be quite honest,
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:01.040]   is getting it from a high quality brand and source.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.200]   It's difficult to get as a single source,
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.680]   which is a very, very important thing to do with supplements
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.040]   is try to get them sourced alone.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.720]   Rodeo la typically comes in combination
[01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:13.000]   with any other herbals or other stuff,
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.440]   adrenal support and et cetera, et cetera.
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:17.900]   Also then getting them then third-party certified,
[01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:20.120]   which for most folks is not necessary,
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:20.960]   but for any athletes
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.920]   that need to go through drug testing systems,
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:25.920]   you should not take any supplement at all
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:28.640]   that does not have some sort of third-party certification.
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:30.200]   So those are the challenges.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:32.680]   That being said, if you've ever ran into somebody
[01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:34.080]   who's taken Rodeo la and they're like,
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.800]   I didn't do anything for me, it's possible.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.720]   That's, you know, nothing works for everyone.
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.360]   It also could be just very poor quality sourcing.
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:45.120]   So if you look at the,
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:49.180]   there have been a number of papers on its perception
[01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:51.180]   of fatigue and you sort of mentioned
[01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:54.180]   that you felt pretty immediate effects
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:55.300]   of taking it a few times.
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:57.240]   - Yeah, I'm fairly sensitive to supplements,
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:02.060]   but I've started taking Rodeo la before workouts
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:05.200]   and found that I could push much harder,
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:06.640]   much longer through the workout.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.400]   Normally I would, or typically before taking it,
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.900]   that is in sessions where I did not take it,
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:17.520]   I would be able to work out very hard for 20 minutes or so.
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:20.160]   The next 10 minutes I could get some work output
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:23.080]   and then the remaining period of time,
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:24.740]   it was kind of a tapering off.
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:26.960]   Now, granted, these are very intense training sessions.
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.380]   These are not the endurance training sessions.
[01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:29.560]   These are the weight training sessions,
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.080]   that one time per week per body part type sessions.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:37.220]   What I've noticed is I can complete the entire 60 minutes
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:39.560]   with minimal fatigue now.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.800]   I mean, obviously I hit fatigues within sets
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:45.320]   and then of course, you remain human despite taking it,
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:48.460]   but I found to be very useful and I've been using it
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:51.620]   whenever I use Alpha GPC prior to workouts
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:54.820]   and I've been impressed by it overall.
[01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:56.460]   I do wanna highlight something that you said
[01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:59.400]   because I think it's so, so vitally important,
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:02.200]   which is that using single ingredient formulations
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:04.760]   for most things is critical to figuring out
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:07.480]   what works for you, what doesn't, what dosages you need,
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:11.080]   being able to take things two on, one off,
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.840]   two days on, one day off, for instance,
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:15.320]   being able to increase dosage in the morning
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:17.280]   and then maybe reduce the dosage
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:19.580]   and combine with something else in the afternoon.
[01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:20.920]   Single ingredient formulations
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:23.360]   are pretty much the only way to do that.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:26.160]   There's perhaps only one supplement that I take at all
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:27.520]   and that's Athletic Greens
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:30.060]   as they've been a regular podcast sponsor for a long time,
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:32.280]   that is a cocktail of many, many things
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.800]   and those are all adaptogens as well as some probiotics
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:35.960]   and vitamins and things like that.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:38.280]   So I'm not opposed to blends
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:40.980]   where the blends include a lot of nutrients
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:42.160]   that are synergistic,
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.780]   but for all pill capsule-based supplements
[01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:48.800]   where I'm looking for a very targeted effect
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:51.760]   and it's not just about foundational nutrition,
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.480]   I really believe strongly
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.780]   that single ingredient formulations are the way
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:59.360]   that you can build a rational approach to supplementation
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:00.440]   and also make adjustments
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:01.760]   if something isn't making you feel better
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:02.720]   and also make adjustments
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:04.200]   if something's really working for you.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.640]   So for instance, some people might take Alpha GPC
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:09.360]   300 milligrams and not feel anything,
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:11.480]   go up to 600 milligrams, not feel anything,
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:13.380]   maybe just feel kind of, eh, they don't like it.
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:16.520]   Other people like myself took 300 milligrams of Alpha GPC
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:17.360]   the first time I was like,
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:20.140]   wow, this really puts me in the zone,
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:22.140]   but I wanna be really careful how often I use it.
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:25.200]   I did mention I go up to 600 milligrams occasionally,
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:27.360]   but that really puts me on the outer threshold
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:30.220]   of kind of overall levels of focus and amped up
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:32.220]   such that if I drink too much caffeine,
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:33.640]   it can tilt me over the edge.
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.020]   So I encourage people to become scientists of themselves
[01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:37.220]   and the only way to do that
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:39.700]   is to try and limit the number of variables.
[01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:41.180]   And the final point is that
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:43.640]   I think that single ingredient formulations
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:48.020]   are by far the best in terms of changing things over time.
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:51.760]   This could be women during their menstrual cycle
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.380]   might find that during certain phases of the cycle,
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:57.220]   they're more sensitive to certain things than not others.
[01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:58.760]   And for men and women,
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:01.560]   it may be that certain times of year even,
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:04.840]   and certain supplements might go better closer to sleep,
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.080]   some earlier in the day and on and on and on.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:10.080]   There's just no real way, in my opinion,
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:12.760]   to have a supplementation protocol
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:14.920]   that involves lots and lots of blends.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:17.440]   One or two blends, okay, but lots of blends,
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:21.320]   I actually think that's potentially dangerous territory.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:23.640]   - Yeah, I mean, just take rhodiola as a good example.
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:26.400]   I know a new meta-analysis came out
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.720]   just in the last few months looking at it.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:30.760]   And they found in general, you see, again,
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.600]   a slight to moderate improvement
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:35.360]   in everything from power output
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:38.480]   to fatigue resistant antioxidant effects
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:39.640]   to endurance performance.
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:40.880]   So it's like, okay, great.
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.600]   Maybe there's a little bit here.
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:43.840]   Now let's say you went to do it,
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.400]   and the only way you could access rhodiola
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:49.600]   is in combination with that and some lion's mane
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.440]   and some other of these adaptogens.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.660]   And it's like, well, wait a minute.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:55.960]   I just wanted to take this to get a better workout.
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.840]   But now it also came with this stimulant
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:00.520]   or this cortisol suppressor or cortisol activator.
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:03.440]   Well, now all of a sudden you can't take it at night
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:04.640]   or you can't take it in the morning
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:06.240]   'cause you already had coffee.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.000]   Your options are just way limited.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.600]   So I think the biggest part of all that
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.360]   is if something doesn't feel good,
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.160]   you have absolutely no idea.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:15.800]   You don't know if it was rhodiola.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.480]   You don't know if it was the Boswellia that's in there.
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.060]   You don't know if it was any of the other things
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:19.920]   that were smashed in there,
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:21.320]   or it could be something as simple
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:24.920]   as the citric acid they use,
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:26.240]   like some other combination of thing.
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:28.520]   And now here you are thinking that some supplement
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.360]   that actually works for you doesn't,
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:33.040]   and you throw that out of your repertoire
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:33.880]   for the rest of your life,
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:36.040]   which is not the biggest crime,
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.880]   but it's not needed and you're not really going to know.
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.880]   So yeah, I fully stamped.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:43.120]   You can look back at my course lectures for the last decade
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:45.760]   and you will see like stamped number one
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.020]   on the supplement of the sections
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:50.720]   is make sure you're taking single ingredient supplements
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:51.780]   at all costs.
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:56.960]   The last part about that too is you're more likely
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:01.820]   to ensure the amount that is on the label is correct.
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:04.340]   So if you're taking Rhodiola and it says,
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:06.480]   you know, it's a hundred milligrams in there,
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:08.060]   and if that's only thing that's in there,
[01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:11.000]   you're more likely than not to actually get something close.
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.180]   Now they're never perfect, but it will be close.
[01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:15.520]   If it's in a combination of 20 other things,
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:18.100]   you actually don't have any idea if that's in there.
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:22.200]   In fact, there have been many papers on melatonin
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:25.480]   and vitamin D and a number of other supplements
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:27.400]   in which when you actually just pull them off the shelf,
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:29.320]   these are standard studies where they would go
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:31.760]   and I said like 20 to 25 different supplements
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.520]   in the case of melatonin.
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:34.900]   And they will actually measure the amount of melatonin
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:35.740]   actually in them.
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:38.940]   And despite the fact that the label says five milligrams,
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:41.700]   they can be up to a 500 to a thousand fold
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:43.820]   actual concentration in that supplement.
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:45.540]   And then you wonder why some people react great
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:47.820]   to melatonin and some people that absolutely destroys you.
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:49.780]   And this is also why like we'll actually,
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:52.460]   we'll see this constantly where people will have
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:56.360]   like 500 times the upper limit of melatonin
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:57.820]   the morning after.
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:44:59.980]   When the half-life is supposed to be more like 90 minutes,
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:01.460]   it should be totally gone.
[01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:03.260]   But we're seeing extremely high,
[01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:05.060]   I'm not even talking like double.
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:08.020]   I'm talking 10, 20, 30 X the upper limit range
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:09.760]   for melatonin the next morning.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:10.880]   And then it's like, well, what are you taking?
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:14.180]   He's like, oh, I got this melatonin at X store
[01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:17.040]   or X website and you're like, holy cow.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:20.820]   So I'm not opposed to melatonin theoretically,
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:23.100]   but you have to be careful with that one in particular.
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:25.780]   So any supplement has that to be true.
[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:29.220]   So you wanna buy them from as many places
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:30.580]   as you can that are high quality.
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:32.100]   And if they are third-party tested,
[01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:35.040]   even if you're not a performance athlete,
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:35.880]   I wanna stress this,
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:37.380]   even if you're not a performance athlete,
[01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:40.580]   third-party certified and tested supplements,
[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:44.020]   you're less likely to just get wildly high concentrations
[01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:45.900]   or low concentrations of active ingredients.
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:49.380]   And so relative to other ones who you might get for cheaper,
[01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:50.980]   but you could be totally wrecking yourself
[01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:54.500]   by getting 50 milligrams of melatonin every night
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:55.380]   and not realizing it.
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:56.460]   So then of course the next morning
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:58.500]   you drown yourself in caffeine
[01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:01.080]   and then you can see what death cycle you're in now.
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:02.620]   - Yeah, and people could look for
[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:04.960]   third-party certification on the packaging.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:07.660]   And some websites will allow you to zoom in
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:08.840]   on the bottle beforehand.
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:12.780]   It's largely listed on certain vendor websites.
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:15.380]   A brief point about supplement cost and blends.
[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:17.420]   And I promise this will be a brief point.
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:20.800]   Different ingredients,
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:22.420]   meaning different types of supplements
[01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:26.120]   have widely varying costs in order to, you know,
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:28.300]   create, to get them, to manufacture them.
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:30.500]   So often what you'll find is that
[01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:34.500]   blends will include the least amount
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:38.380]   of the most expensive ingredient, right?
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:39.340]   Not always the case.
[01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:41.700]   There are some, there are certain exceptions to this.
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:44.300]   And I mentioned some blends that I like a few minutes ago
[01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:45.820]   that are for foundational nutrition,
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:47.900]   adaptogens and probiotics.
[01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:48.740]   Athletic greens, of course,
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:51.740]   just being one of several examples out there.
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:54.420]   But when it comes to say a sleep blend
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:56.180]   or a pre-workout blend,
[01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:57.860]   there are some decent products out there,
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:59.900]   but a lot of them tend to put in
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:03.220]   more of the least expensive ingredients
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:05.420]   and less of the ones that you're actively seeking.
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:07.460]   And so those tend to be,
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:09.300]   caffeine tends to be a kind of a buffer
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:10.860]   against the other things.
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:12.940]   Meaning if you have pre-workout,
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:15.540]   putting caffeine in there isn't necessarily a bad thing.
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:17.460]   But if it has five other things in there,
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:20.640]   oftentimes what manufacturers will cheat on
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:24.080]   is the actual amount of the things that are costly.
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:26.260]   So again, single ingredient formulations
[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:28.520]   for 80% of your supplements,
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:30.840]   I think is really the way to go.
[01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:33.120]   And the other thing that I know is gonna come up
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:34.740]   as we're talking about all these supplements
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:36.480]   is this issue of dependency.
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.060]   I often get this question
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:41.460]   and when I solicit for questions on social media
[01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:43.060]   in anticipation of this episode,
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:43.900]   number of people said,
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:46.000]   "Okay, so if you take a sleep formulation,
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.060]   do I need to take it every night?
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:47.900]   If I don't take it,
[01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:49.980]   will I have an incredibly hard time sleeping?
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:51.920]   If I take a pre-workout every time I train,
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:53.960]   will I need it?"
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:56.060]   It's a great question.
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:58.560]   Some people will take supplement holidays,
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:47:59.960]   as they may be called,
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:02.460]   for a couple of days each week, back to back.
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:04.220]   Some people take them straight through.
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:07.180]   I myself take a sleep cocktail, we've described this,
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:09.160]   it's magnesium theanine and things.
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.240]   This is not one ingredient, these are multiple ingredients.
[01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:13.940]   In fact, precisely because some people who have sleep,
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:15.520]   walking and vivid dream issues
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:17.340]   can't take theanine before bed.
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:20.220]   In any case, I've had times when I
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:22.660]   either forgot my supplements, that's rare,
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:24.500]   or I just didn't have what I needed,
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:26.040]   or just simply took a break for a night
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:28.480]   and it was not a problem.
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.380]   But in terms of pre-workout,
[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:32.380]   I do think that people become dependent
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:34.900]   on being in that really ramped up state.
[01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:38.180]   But I don't think we view all this as true dependency,
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:39.260]   kind of like addiction.
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:40.100]   - Totally.
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:42.340]   - I mean, I define addiction as a progressive narrowing
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:43.940]   of the things that bring you pleasure.
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:47.780]   So I suppose people could get addicted to pre-workout,
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:49.580]   but it seems a little unlikely.
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:51.260]   More likely there would be a dependency
[01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:53.420]   such that if you didn't have your pre-workout,
[01:48:53.420 --> 01:48:55.380]   you might feel like, oh, you're not motivated to train.
[01:48:55.380 --> 01:48:58.000]   So what are your thoughts on taking little holidays
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.660]   from supplements and varying the frequency
[01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:03.060]   of supplement intake, in particular as it relates
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:05.900]   to stimulants and fatigue reducers?
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:09.240]   - The end goal, anytime I coach somebody,
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:11.540]   is to get them into a physiological state
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:16.280]   in which they require no or close to no supplementation.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:17.580]   That's the target.
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:21.900]   We should really be in a position to where our lifestyle,
[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:24.140]   our sunlight exposure, our stress management,
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:26.340]   our physical activity, our sleep and our hydration,
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:28.020]   and our whole food nutrition
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:30.140]   provide us almost everything we need.
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:34.100]   Now, look, again, there are some foundational items
[01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:35.720]   that we can give people.
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.700]   We've put together a little bundle actually for this,
[01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:40.900]   the basic things that you can go look at.
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:42.520]   But that's the goal, right?
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:44.980]   So the target is to let your physiology run the guide.
[01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:47.680]   Your physiology is way smarter than we are.
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:49.860]   Even if I take a bunch of biomarkers from you,
[01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:51.620]   your physiology still knows better
[01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:53.460]   than those few markers can tell me.
[01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:55.540]   So that's always where we're ending up.
[01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:59.360]   I actually personally don't like people being in a position
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:02.420]   that they have to take a supplement for anything.
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:04.500]   So I don't like it if you have to take a supplement
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:05.660]   to have a good night of sleep.
[01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:08.080]   I don't like it if you have to have a supplement to train.
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:12.500]   We will use any of these stimulants very, very carefully
[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:14.000]   with any of the athletes we work with
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.520]   and certainly for the non-athletes,
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:17.580]   because at least the athletes, we have an end date.
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:19.000]   We have a fight schedule.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:19.840]   We have a season.
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:21.920]   We have a game you're gonna pitch, whatever.
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:23.080]   When you don't have that,
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:25.000]   it's sort of like you're in this endless cycle of,
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.060]   oh, you're just gonna do that all day, every day?
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:30.520]   We don't really need to be in that spot.
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:33.800]   So the way that I'll describe my philosophy is
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:36.640]   I will use those short-term tactics
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:38.440]   to symptom manage if I have to.
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:39.840]   So if somebody comes to me and they're like,
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:42.600]   you're feeling awful and we've got to get through the hump.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:43.440]   Okay, great.
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:45.160]   Maybe we'll give you something for sleep immediately
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:46.580]   to get you sleeping.
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:48.280]   That allows us to then come back
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:50.600]   and work on the causal problem, right?
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:51.560]   So this is what is,
[01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:53.940]   why are you having a hard time sleeping anyways?
[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:58.720]   If you have to take a nine cocktail supplement to sleep,
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:01.520]   then all we're doing is blinding the reason.
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:03.200]   Why are you in that position to begin with, right?
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:05.820]   So we see this all the time, whether it is sleep problems,
[01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:07.520]   whether it is cortisol or testosterone,
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.580]   the question is, well, why is that low?
[01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:10.800]   Now we may give you something again
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:13.440]   to manage it immediately, but the task,
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:16.440]   the mystery I'm going to try to unveil is why?
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.500]   Why is it there to begin with?
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:20.460]   This could be something like this is natural for you
[01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:23.160]   and your lack of energy is something else.
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:25.840]   Or it could be, actually it is not a natural level for you,
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.160]   but something is suppressing it.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:30.180]   Any number of, you've got some infection going on,
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:31.920]   there's some allergic reaction
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:33.180]   to something in your environment.
[01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:37.520]   There's a mold, mercury, like that one comes up a lot.
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:38.600]   You'll see mercury in folks
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:40.120]   and that's causing a lot of problems.
[01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:43.120]   Or any number of heavy metals or toxins,
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:45.440]   any host of things, psychological distress,
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:47.420]   bad daily habit, you don't ever see the sun.
[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:50.440]   Like you don't ever sweat, you don't ever drink.
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.720]   We was talking about so many things.
[01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:54.300]   So I'm always going to hunt for that.
[01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:55.540]   And I hate using this phrase.
[01:51:55.540 --> 01:51:59.560]   It's highly maligned for a good reason, but root cause.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:01.140]   All right, so we're trying to find that.
[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:02.160]   It's like, are we making sure
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:03.480]   that we're not causing this problem?
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:06.480]   And I'm not going to want to give you a supplement
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:08.760]   to cover up something if we're not even trying
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:11.940]   to solve the problem of what's being there.
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:13.960]   That being said, am I that concerned
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:16.100]   about people taking a multivitamin?
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:18.200]   Just all throughout, no, not really.
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:20.200]   Am I concerned about people taking creatine?
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:22.200]   No, like go ahead.
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:25.180]   Those ones are generally pretty fine to just take.
[01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:28.080]   But anything else, I want a reason.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:31.100]   I really don't like giving people anything
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:33.540]   in a super physiological concentration
[01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:35.520]   or a super food concentration, right?
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.680]   So again, an amount you wouldn't find in a normal food dosage
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.480]   unless we have really a specific reason.
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:42.900]   Some of these things are more problematic.
[01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:44.760]   Others are less problematic.
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:47.320]   So to answer the question of dependency,
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:48.360]   you have a combination
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:51.080]   of actual physiological dependency, caffeine.
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:53.640]   Like that actually creates a physiological dependency
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:58.160]   versus a emotional or psychological dependency
[01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:00.220]   or just a, I like drinking this.
[01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:01.840]   Like that's my habit, that's my routine.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:04.060]   There's a fancy scientific phrase for that,
[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:05.540]   but it doesn't matter.
[01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:07.080]   So yeah, we wanna get off that.
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:09.080]   And like, again, my personal philosophy is
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:10.640]   I don't want you dependent upon anything.
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:12.900]   I wanna create extremely resilient people.
[01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:14.640]   And I wanna create physiological resilience.
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:16.800]   We actually have a fancy little algorithm we use
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:18.440]   to measure that in people.
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.880]   And so we can actually calculate that number.
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:21.920]   And the goal of us is to push that number higher
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:24.140]   so that we don't have to have anything.
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:26.720]   So many situations pop up in your real life
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:28.420]   that you're not gonna have your supplement
[01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:29.660]   or you're not gonna have your routine
[01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:32.080]   or you're not gonna have your journal or whatever,
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:33.600]   but also for the longterm.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.040]   I don't wanna create a situation
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:36.700]   in which this is a short-term success
[01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:39.460]   that you have to now do that the rest of your life.
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:40.720]   Now, let's just get out of the way.
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:42.680]   Let's fix the problem if there is something,
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:45.320]   symptom management, that's real,
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.360]   while we're actually searching
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:49.180]   for better foundational habits.
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:51.960]   The last thing I wanna say about this is
[01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:53.980]   if you're only covering symptom,
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:57.000]   you're really missing signal, right?
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.740]   Which is if you're constantly tired throughout the day
[01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:01.280]   and all you're doing is giving yourself
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:04.740]   a number of alpha GPCs and caffeine, et cetera,
[01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:06.500]   even though there's good little sugar,
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.140]   are you really just using that
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:10.460]   to allow your poor sleep hygiene to happen?
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:13.020]   If they took those away, I bet you,
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:14.860]   you would actually start addressing your sleep
[01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:16.100]   if that's the cause, right?
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:18.580]   Or your stress or your poor hydration.
[01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:20.580]   You would go hunting for the problem.
[01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:23.140]   And so you wanna walk a fine line here of going like,
[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:26.020]   "Hey, look, is an athletic greens supplement
[01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:26.860]   "that big a deal?"
[01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:27.700]   No, probably not.
[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:31.260]   But wait a minute, am I actually now covering up
[01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:33.780]   the pain point that is maybe needed?
[01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:36.700]   It's a signal to actually get my ass in gear
[01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:41.200]   to go make one of these changes, whatever it needs to be.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:43.820]   So I know I've got like a little bit meta on you
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:44.740]   and a little bit philosophical,
[01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:46.060]   but that's honestly how I approach it.
[01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:47.260]   - Yeah, I think it's really important.
[01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:50.120]   A friend of mine who's a physician has a great saying,
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:53.160]   which is better living through chemistry
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:54.780]   still requires better living.
[01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:57.220]   - Oh, boy, that's cool then, that's so good.
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:59.140]   - You know, and it pertains also to things
[01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:02.540]   like antidepressants and ADHD drugs and things of that sort.
[01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:04.780]   Most all of those things were developed as tools
[01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:08.500]   to allow people to move from a maladaptive state.
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:10.100]   Maladaptive is hard to define,
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:13.140]   but think about in any domain of life,
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:14.540]   you can either be back on your heels,
[01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:17.280]   flat-footed or forward center of mass.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:20.620]   And there are times when people are so compromised
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:23.720]   neurochemically that they need to use pharmacology
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:26.420]   in order to get into a flat-footed position.
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:27.640]   You know, they're really back on their heels,
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:29.120]   flat-footed or forward center of mass.
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:31.940]   But the idea was always that those things were developed
[01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:33.540]   as things to allow people to engage
[01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:34.960]   in the sorts of behaviors that can produce
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:36.960]   the same sorts of neurochemical shifts.
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:38.180]   And if people are thinking, well,
[01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:41.140]   what sorts of behaviors can induce
[01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:42.160]   these neurochemical shifts?
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:44.580]   I'll just zoom out myself for a moment here and say,
[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:48.280]   I am a big proponent, I believe you are as well, if I may,
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:53.340]   in doing behavioral tools first whenever possible.
[01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:56.700]   Really establishing good habits, the do's and don'ts,
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.280]   which we've talked a lot about in this series
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:55:59.820]   and in this episode.
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:03.380]   Then excellent nutrition, which involves do's and don'ts,
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:06.400]   volume, food choice, timing, all the factors.
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:09.720]   And then also supplementation.
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:13.060]   And also they're sometimes a case for prescription drugs,
[01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:17.020]   certainly, and often brain machine interface
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:20.640]   or body machine interface, measuring stuff using devices.
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:23.760]   But the foundation of behaviors and good nutrition
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:26.240]   are really, truly foundational.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:28.860]   And it's hard in anything to skip steps,
[01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:31.160]   but supplements and prescription drugs are one place
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:34.400]   where people often skip steps and then they don't actually
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:37.600]   learn how to cultivate the best behavioral practices,
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:39.720]   including the don'ts, as you mentioned.
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:42.640]   And then just one more point along these lines.
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:46.320]   You know, you talked about taking anything for energy
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:49.080]   is really disruptive to the system.
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:51.180]   And it is because, especially caffeine,
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:53.900]   while it has its uses and even health benefits,
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:55.520]   it's really borrowing.
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:59.080]   It's against the adenosine system with interest.
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:02.680]   And so, because caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist,
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:05.920]   effectively, while caffeine is present in those receptors,
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:06.900]   you don't feel as sleepy.
[01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:09.760]   You have more energy, your reaction time goes down,
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:12.400]   memories, enhanced focus, performance of all kinds.
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:15.720]   Yes, but then when that caffeine is dislodged
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:18.720]   from the receptor, then the adenosine can act
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:21.120]   even more potently at those receptors.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:23.720]   So it's sort of like being able to borrow against
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:26.080]   the normal variations in wakefulness and sleep.
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:27.640]   And this is why we encourage people,
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.320]   if they're not training first thing in the morning
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:30.680]   to push their caffeine intake out
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:32.640]   about 90 to 120 minutes after waking,
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:34.800]   so they can clear some of that adenosine in the morning,
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:39.180]   which tends to happen even after we wake up.
[01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:41.740]   People can listen to the episodes on Master Your Sleep
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:43.400]   or Perfect Sleep or the caffeine episode
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:44.780]   to understand more about that.
[01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:46.560]   But the final thing I just want to say here,
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:48.840]   and then it prompts a question,
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:53.080]   is in thinking about supplement protocols,
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:56.040]   I think a lot of people assume
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:57.720]   that once they start taking something,
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:57:59.680]   they're going to have to take it all the time.
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:01.800]   And one idea, perhaps,
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:05.520]   is that people have some alpha-GPC around
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:06.940]   that they could take.
[01:58:06.940 --> 01:58:08.960]   And granted, it'd be great if people could try things
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:10.340]   without having to buy a whole product.
[01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:12.400]   I think companies, hopefully, are listening to this
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:14.120]   and will give people a sample
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:15.760]   to see if something works for them
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:17.720]   and then give them an opportunity to try it,
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:18.960]   to have things around,
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:20.120]   but not necessarily assume
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:21.760]   you're going to take it every time.
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:22.880]   Some things you take every day,
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:26.600]   foundational nutrition, supplements, for instance.
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:28.000]   But then also to take a look
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.120]   at how well you're eating or not eating.
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:31.800]   At times when I'm eating much better,
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:34.640]   I, consuming low-sugar fermented foods,
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.920]   which are great for the gut microbiome,
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:37.480]   I consume less probiotics.
[01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:41.080]   If ever I've been really compromised, for whatever reason,
[01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:42.700]   then I will take pill-form probiotics,
[01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:44.800]   but I don't take those all the time
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:45.960]   because I get them from food
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:48.320]   and from certain green drinks,
[01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:49.840]   like athletic greens and so forth.
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:51.840]   So I think that nutrition and supplementation
[01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:54.520]   are tethered in this way in my mind.
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:55.960]   And I don't think that,
[01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:57.960]   most people think of supplementation as something
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.060]   that where you can induce a lot of variability
[01:59:00.060 --> 01:59:01.460]   in when and how you take them.
[01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:02.640]   But as far as I'm concerned,
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:04.820]   as long as they're single ingredient formulations,
[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:09.200]   you can use supplements once a week if you want.
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:10.480]   You can use them seven days a week.
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:12.520]   You could use them twice a day,
[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:14.600]   four times a day, every day,
[01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:16.640]   or you could use them not at all.
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:17.480]   Agreed?
[01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:18.320]   - Yeah.
[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:22.060]   Some of them will have an effect randomly like that.
[01:59:22.060 --> 01:59:23.540]   Others will not.
[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:25.820]   And we talked about creatine being one of them.
[01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:28.180]   It's, if you're going to take it once or so a week,
[01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:29.600]   then there's, I mean, basically-
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:30.440]   - No benefit.
[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:31.260]   That's a very good point.
[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:32.680]   Yeah, creatine's-
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:35.700]   - Beta alanine is another fantastic example
[01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:37.880]   of something you need to take consistently
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:39.520]   if you want some sort of benefit.
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.120]   It needs to be built up in muscle.
[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:44.720]   We need to use that to create carnosine,
[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:45.880]   which is what's actually going to help us
[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:46.880]   with our fatigue management.
[01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:49.160]   That's why we call it like an acid buffer.
[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:50.680]   So in our previous metabolism episode,
[01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:53.400]   we talked about that being a major cause of fatigue.
[01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:54.320]   The wonderful part,
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:56.320]   one of the reasons why beta alanine works so effectively
[01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:58.740]   is it blocks that buildup.
[01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:00.120]   So that is an example of another one
[02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:01.080]   that you would want to take.
[02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:03.120]   Other things like fish oil,
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:05.000]   you could certainly skip a day here and there.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.400]   It wouldn't be that big a deal.
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:08.160]   I also do support your comment
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:10.160]   of you can take absolutely none of these things
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:12.520]   and be just fine.
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:13.720]   In terms of,
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:16.800]   and we'll come back maybe to beta alanine in a second.
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:18.520]   In terms of some other fun stuff,
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:21.740]   my colleague Greg Osicki ran a really cool number of studies
[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:25.400]   looking at how exercise actually alters the gut microbiome.
[02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:26.840]   This is actually an area that we've,
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:29.360]   I probably have 300 stool samples
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:30.800]   sitting in my freezer in my lab.
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:32.600]   - Well, goodness, another reason to pause
[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:33.920]   before entering your lab.
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:35.760]   - Yeah, another reason to not apply
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:37.960]   to come be one of my graduate students,
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:39.560]   unless you want to deal with that.
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:40.400]   And we actually have a number,
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:42.000]   we've applied for a couple of grants
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.920]   to look more into this, specifically with females.
[02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:46.500]   So hopefully we can get that funded.
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:51.500]   But nonetheless, you can actually see some pretty traumatic,
[02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:52.880]   and I say that word on purpose,
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:54.240]   changes in the gut microbiome.
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:55.760]   This one in particular study I was thinking of
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:58.640]   that Greg did is he looked at the changes
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:00.080]   pre, post and ultra marathon.
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:03.900]   And even within a single bout of exercise,
[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:05.480]   I can't remember the sum of the markers,
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:08.400]   but I know one of the markers was specifically increased
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:12.880]   by like 14,000% after a single bout of exercise.
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:14.640]   Now this is an ultra marathon.
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:17.720]   This is like totally absurd amount of exercise
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:20.160]   relative to what normal people would be.
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:24.720]   But that number, I remember it was like 14,229%
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:26.800]   or like something, some random number like that.
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:27.920]   - Of something meaningful?
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:28.960]   - Yeah, something meaningful.
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:32.500]   I can't remember which marker that was.
[02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:33.760]   That had changed.
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:35.560]   I know streptococcus was in there.
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:37.240]   Streptococcus went up like maybe something more
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:39.200]   like 30 or 40 or 50%.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:42.320]   The point is we haven't even had the proper time,
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:45.600]   and we don't, to even launch into the gut microbiome.
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:48.620]   Supplementation there needs to be ultra specific.
[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:51.500]   You wouldn't be best served to just jump in
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:53.160]   and take random things there.
[02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:56.160]   It's a whole area of emerging science.
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:57.780]   We know very, very, very little about it,
[02:01:57.780 --> 02:01:59.600]   but there is a number of actionable things
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:01.440]   one could do there.
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:05.040]   So probably something to not mess with.
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:07.560]   I would certainly work with a qualified physician
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:09.520]   if you think you have something going on clinical
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:13.120]   or some actual problem there.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:15.280]   Don't work with someone who's not a specialist,
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:16.140]   a medical doctor there,
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:19.600]   but just randomly assigning a bunch of probiotics
[02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:21.000]   or prebiotics without intention
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.840]   is maybe the next forefront of human performance research,
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:26.920]   but we'll have to maybe come back in a few years
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:27.960]   and dive into that in detail,
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:30.380]   or perhaps you can bring somebody out as an expert in that
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:31.720]   to discuss that.
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:33.560]   - Yeah, gut microbiome is fascinating.
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:37.240]   I think of sleep as the most powerful
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:40.060]   performance enhancing activity.
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:43.180]   Of course you still have to do the activity.
[02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:45.500]   I consider it foundational.
[02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:48.160]   It basically raises the tide on mental health,
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:50.620]   physical health, performance of all kinds.
[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:54.380]   There's recent data that during sleep,
[02:02:54.380 --> 02:02:57.080]   your body goes through all its various forms
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:00.600]   of metabolism possible, which is amazing.
[02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:02.680]   So it's measured from breath in human subjects,
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:04.560]   breath metabolites in human subjects.
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:08.140]   So obviously if one is thinking about supplementation
[02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:10.660]   and wondering, okay, what's the best supplement
[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:11.720]   to enhance performance?
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:14.420]   You gave some great rationale for why creatine
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:16.920]   would be an excellent choice provided you're eating well
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:19.440]   and hydrating well.
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:23.120]   And then to my mind, the next thing on the list
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:27.520]   would be anything that allows you to improve the quality
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:29.720]   and maybe even the duration of your sleep.
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:31.760]   Although if you wake up and you feel rested
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:33.640]   throughout the day and only need a short nap
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:35.520]   in the afternoon, not everyone needs one,
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:37.360]   but then generally that means you're feeling okay.
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:39.780]   People sometimes get flipped onto this idea
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:41.240]   that they have insomnia.
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:43.460]   Insomnia is excessive daytime sleepiness
[02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:44.740]   where you're falling asleep during the day.
[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:45.680]   That's insomnia.
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:48.360]   It could also be narcolepsy, but that's insomnia.
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:51.940]   But supplementation to improve the quality
[02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:54.240]   or duration of sleep or both,
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:56.640]   seems to me like the most direct route,
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:59.560]   even though actually technically it's an indirect route
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:01.600]   to a performance enhancement.
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:05.360]   And then thinking about things that increase alertness
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:07.640]   and stimulants and fatigue reducers.
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:09.080]   Do you think that's a good logic?
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.820]   - Yeah, we go to absurd lengths
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:15.040]   to dial sleep in as much as we can.
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:18.440]   I mean, the honest answer is like truly absurd.
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:21.200]   This is a conflict of interest that my company,
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:23.880]   I'm a part of this, Absolute Rest is anyway that company.
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:25.920]   We actually go out to your house
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:29.200]   and run a full clinical grade sleep study in your bedroom
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:31.080]   on you and run that over multiple nights.
[02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:32.400]   So instead of having to go to a sleep clinic
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:34.560]   and have it done in this weird hospital room
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:36.000]   or sort of setting with these people
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.740]   looking at you through a mirror, it's like totally creepy.
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:41.540]   That is important because that's the only way
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:43.400]   to truly determine how you are sleeping.
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:46.720]   Now that said, the technology of wearable trackers
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:47.560]   is getting better.
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:50.320]   In fact, I would actually predict those things
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:52.880]   will reach a level of accuracy equivalent to the PSG
[02:04:52.880 --> 02:04:53.720]   in the next couple of years
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:55.660]   and probably we'll get FDA approval
[02:04:55.660 --> 02:04:58.800]   to be able to diagnose officially sleep disorders.
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:01.640]   That's my prediction from some inside information.
[02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:02.480]   I don't know that to be true,
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:03.880]   but it is getting a lot better.
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:06.400]   Right now those wearables are not accurate enough
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:07.720]   to meet that threshold.
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:10.840]   So what we do is we bring up basically all the equipment
[02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:11.680]   to do that.
[02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:12.640]   So we'll come in and do that.
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:15.480]   Now, once we understand exactly how you're sleeping,
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:16.920]   the next question is to answer,
[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:18.400]   why are you sleeping that way?
[02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:21.380]   And so this is a full fourfold system.
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:23.840]   Number one is we're going to look at biology,
[02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:26.160]   which means you're going to take saliva and blood.
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:29.580]   And we're looking at everything from neurotransmitters,
[02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:33.400]   concentrations to vitamins, B6, B12, et cetera,
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:35.520]   that are important for sleep performance.
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:38.040]   So we're going to see, is it a physiological problem?
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:39.000]   Is there something happening there?
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.820]   Is cortisol DHEA ratio that we've previously talked about
[02:05:41.820 --> 02:05:44.400]   or is something like that off?
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:45.480]   If it's not physiology,
[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:47.840]   then we're going on the next one, which is environmental.
[02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:50.400]   We run a full environmental scan of your bedroom
[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:52.520]   during those nights of sleep that were there.
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:54.280]   And that's really important because we can look at everything
[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:57.680]   from dander and pollen and allergens that are in the air.
[02:05:57.680 --> 02:06:02.400]   A quick tip here is wash your sheets at least once a week.
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:04.780]   One of the common, most common places
[02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:08.200]   that people get allergens in the air
[02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:10.440]   is actually from accumulation on your sheets.
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:12.600]   So if you clean those more often,
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:14.200]   you'll be in a better spot.
[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:16.940]   And next one, the next one there also is like, keep your,
[02:06:16.940 --> 02:06:18.140]   I'm sorry, this hurts my heart.
[02:06:18.140 --> 02:06:21.800]   I don't even, in truthfulness, I violate this,
[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:24.520]   but keep your pets out of your bedroom and certainly
[02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:26.200]   keep them off your bed.
[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:29.400]   Our ghost face killer is my dog and Nelke's my other one.
[02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:32.240]   They don't go on my bed, but they're right next to my bed.
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:33.280]   So we violate that one.
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:36.500]   But full environmental scan includes all those things.
[02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:39.920]   Of course, we measure light and temperature and humidity
[02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:42.840]   and everything else that's going on in the room.
[02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:45.000]   Volatile organics that are coming out of the mattress,
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.120]   formaldehyde, lead out of the wall,
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:49.320]   like all of these things that could potentially
[02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:50.200]   disrupt your sleep.
[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:52.040]   And we wanna make sure that none of those things
[02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:52.880]   are kicking on.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:54.640]   We see this constantly.
[02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:57.480]   People will have things like trying to be cool
[02:06:57.480 --> 02:07:00.440]   and they wanna be cold at night 'cause that's important.
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:02.600]   And so they'll turn an air conditioner on or a fan,
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:04.520]   but the air conditioner kicking on and off at night
[02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:06.820]   actually can shoot you out of various sleep stages.
[02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:09.040]   So you wanna be really careful about this going.
[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:12.160]   The last metric on that is actually CO2.
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:14.600]   And so what you remember from our metabolism discussion
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:17.580]   is when you exhale, you're breathing out CO2.
[02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:21.180]   Well, if your room is closed and the ventilation isn't great,
[02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:23.260]   the amount of CO2 in your room starts to build up.
[02:07:23.260 --> 02:07:26.620]   And we actually very specifically know the threshold
[02:07:26.620 --> 02:07:27.820]   based on information collected
[02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:29.840]   from the International Space Station, actually.
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:32.060]   We know the threshold at which CO2 crosses
[02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:33.700]   and starts disrupting sleep.
[02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:35.060]   So we wanna make sure that you're not sitting
[02:07:35.060 --> 02:07:37.060]   in this CO2 bath in front of your face
[02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:39.120]   and then breathing it back in and disrupting your sleep.
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:41.020]   So environment is the second one.
[02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:43.800]   The third one is actually now psychology.
[02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:47.240]   So one of the members on our team is a Harvard MD
[02:07:47.240 --> 02:07:51.000]   in psychiatry and put together an entire sleep scan survey.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.740]   So we run through all that to see if there's anxiety,
[02:07:52.740 --> 02:07:55.560]   depression, anything like that psychologically going on.
[02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:57.480]   And then the fourth one there
[02:07:57.480 --> 02:08:00.660]   is if you have some sort of actual sleep pathology.
[02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:03.440]   And so this again will include some eye tracking stuff
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:04.280]   that we can use.
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:07.600]   So we take all those data, they go back to our team.
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:10.360]   We work in combination with Steve Lockie from Harvard,
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:11.200]   who's done a ton of stuff.
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:13.020]   He actually set up a lot of the circadian rhythm stuff
[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:14.960]   in the International Space Station as well.
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:17.140]   Himself, Jeffrey Drummer, an MD PhD, et cetera.
[02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:20.360]   And all of these folks in a room go over your data,
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:23.220]   identify what's going on and build action plans off of that.
[02:08:23.220 --> 02:08:26.140]   Occasionally those action plans will include supplementation,
[02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:27.340]   but only if necessary.
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:29.120]   We're really gonna try to come back
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:32.580]   and work through a system to improve the sleep,
[02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:33.420]   however is needed.
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:37.400]   So I realized that is not totally accessible
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:38.240]   for a lot of people,
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:41.460]   but like if you really need to go to the end of the earth
[02:08:41.460 --> 02:08:44.800]   to figure it out sleep, that service is available.
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:47.440]   Absolute Rest sounds like an amazing tool,
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:50.800]   given that most people won't be able to use it
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:52.680]   or access it, although we will provide a link
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:56.380]   in case people are interested in it and do want to try it.
[02:08:56.380 --> 02:08:59.480]   You mentioned a few things that I think everyone
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:03.500]   should assay their sleeping environment for
[02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:07.900]   and determine whether or not they are hindering their sleep
[02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:08.740]   without realizing it.
[02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:11.200]   For instance, the air conditioning going on and off,
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:12.740]   or this could be heater going on and off,
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:15.780]   or central heating or cooling unit.
[02:09:15.780 --> 02:09:18.500]   This could be keeping the room dark.
[02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:20.660]   This could be cleaning your sheets.
[02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:22.980]   Certainly that doesn't require
[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:24.220]   that one sign up for Absolute Rest.
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:25.740]   So cleaning one sheets routinely,
[02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:27.500]   keeping pets out of the bedroom,
[02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:30.200]   as you admitted you don't entirely,
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:33.140]   different opinions about that.
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:34.260]   But if you're having sleep issues,
[02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:36.820]   the dander from animals may be part of those issues.
[02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:38.840]   And then one that I'll just add,
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:40.240]   which I think is pretty interesting,
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:43.800]   is there's some beautiful data out of Michael Turman's lab
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:46.960]   at Columbia Medical School in New York
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:48.860]   on negative ionization.
[02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:52.240]   And this sounds pretty wacky, kind of new agey.
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:54.240]   I'm sure some people are like, negative ionization.
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:57.000]   But listen, the Turman lab is a serious laboratory
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.080]   focused on circadian biology for many decades now.
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:01.600]   Negative ion concentrations
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:03.800]   are higher near coastal locations.
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:06.120]   So if you've ever gone to the sea or gone on vacation
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:08.720]   and you sleep better near a body of water,
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:10.720]   that's actually a real thing.
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:12.640]   And there are negative ionization machines,
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:14.200]   but there are also some things that one can do
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:17.040]   in order to increase the negative ion concentration
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:18.540]   in their sleeping environment
[02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:22.040]   that are nearly zero cost, if not zero cost.
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:23.560]   You can look those up online
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:25.160]   and we probably will do an entire episode
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:26.000]   about this in the future.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.520]   But I think what you described for Absolute Rest
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:30.600]   really highlights a more general set of themes
[02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:31.640]   that I think are really important,
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:34.440]   which is your sleep environment is an environment.
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:36.120]   It's got a lot going on in it.
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:38.840]   And it's worth running through the checklist
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:40.640]   that you described and asking,
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:43.600]   where are things maybe not optimized,
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:45.380]   but where am I really getting in my own way
[02:10:45.380 --> 02:10:46.900]   in terms of sleep?
[02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:48.600]   All of this, again, being related to the fact
[02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:51.080]   that getting excellent sleep consistently
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:54.040]   will completely transform everything that you do
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:56.320]   and not getting excellent sleep consistently,
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:58.880]   which is a challenge for so, so many people,
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:01.100]   will also transform everything that you do
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:03.440]   and think and feel, but in the negative direction.
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:06.160]   - Yeah, I can also offer a few tips on sleep
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:08.240]   based on things we find most consistently
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:11.040]   for those that can't go through the whole protocol.
[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:15.160]   One quick little actually app called Time Shifter
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:17.180]   is really cool for anyone that's dealing
[02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:19.340]   with consistent travel and jet lag.
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:22.000]   So you can go and enter your location, your time,
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.240]   where you're going, the location,
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:25.960]   and then it'll actually back calculate
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:29.440]   and it'll give you full light, stimulant, food,
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:30.660]   hydration and stuff protocol,
[02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:31.880]   and you just follow along with that.
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:34.040]   And we've used that for many years actually,
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:36.500]   especially when traveling to Abu Dhabi for advice
[02:11:36.500 --> 02:11:40.000]   and Mongolia and Brazil for the Olympics
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.060]   and sort of all over the place.
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:44.360]   So I think that app is still available, I hope so.
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:46.600]   It's great, a nice tool.
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:48.480]   A couple of things we found major.
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:50.300]   If you're dealing with acid reflux,
[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:53.000]   so if you're someone who has problems like that,
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:57.240]   you can just elevate the head of your bed by like six inches.
[02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:59.120]   So if you put little piece of wood
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:00.680]   or something underneath it,
[02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:03.400]   you can also buy very inexpensive pillows
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:04.240]   that can elevate that.
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:05.680]   Now that's not solving the problem,
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:07.420]   but at least it can help you sleep,
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:08.420]   whether it's just that night
[02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:11.500]   or if it's a consistent problem, you can do there.
[02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:14.880]   If you're snoring, like I said, that's not really benign,
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:16.320]   you should probably take a look at that.
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:18.320]   Your first step there is mouth tape.
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:19.200]   If that doesn't work,
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:21.960]   you can go through what's called myofunctional therapy,
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:23.700]   which I don't know if you've covered that before,
[02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:25.840]   but it's basically tongue exercises.
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:28.640]   And that can be quite effective specifically for people
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:31.080]   who have problems with REM sleep.
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:33.140]   So myofunctional therapy,
[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:36.820]   it's kind of like you do, depending on the protocol,
[02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:38.480]   some tongue exercises kind of in the morning,
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:39.480]   afternoon and night.
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:41.680]   And that takes a while, to be honest,
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:43.660]   you're probably going to need at least six weeks
[02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:44.760]   before you start seeing anything,
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:47.020]   but that actually is pretty well demonstrated
[02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:47.860]   to help with sleep.
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:50.280]   So you can probably Google, we could find a link
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:52.800]   for exact protocols, I don't wanna describe all them,
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:54.800]   but yeah, you're gonna strengthen your tongue
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:57.040]   so that it stops falling in the back of your neck
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:58.120]   and waking you up at night.
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:01.340]   So that's a really free, easy free protocol to use.
[02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:06.560]   If you're struggling with not, it could be insomnia,
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:08.900]   but it could be just things like when you get into bed,
[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:10.840]   you're super tired and you can't fall asleep
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:12.480]   or things like that.
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:15.000]   Kind of a basic rule of thumb we use
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.120]   is only two things happen in your bed.
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:17.960]   And if you can make sure
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:20.180]   those are the only two things you do in your bed,
[02:13:20.180 --> 02:13:22.800]   the problems of falling asleep or insomnia tend to go down.
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:25.000]   Those two things are you have sex and you sleep
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.440]   and nothing else goes down in your bed.
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:29.660]   And so you can make that environment very special
[02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:32.680]   and that can help quite effectively improve your ability
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:35.000]   to fall asleep and then not wake up early.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:39.720]   So keeping that environment specific to what it's for
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:40.600]   can be effective.
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:43.720]   The only other thing I would think of is,
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:45.860]   and I hate to say this 'cause it's not super practical,
[02:13:45.860 --> 02:13:48.400]   but it's just quite clear at this point,
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:50.440]   sleeping with a partner in your bed,
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:52.560]   it's just not very good for sleep.
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:53.720]   - Good luck with that one.
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:54.840]   - I know.
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:57.920]   You can do a couple of things if it helps.
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:13:59.500]   You can get two smaller beds
[02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:01.400]   and put them right next to each other.
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:03.480]   If you can actually have separate sheets,
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:05.600]   that alone can be helpful.
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:08.320]   So if you get, even if you're on a king-sized bed
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:10.480]   or something, and again, I know some people,
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:11.600]   they're just like, there's no chance,
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:15.320]   but if you want to know the cost for your like the effect--
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:16.440]   - You can end your relationship.
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:19.520]   - You can just lose your loved one.
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:22.120]   Ideally-- - Please don't, please don't.
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:22.960]   Oh my goodness.
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:26.360]   - So the only last thing I want to mention here
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:29.800]   is something that's popped up just a few times recently,
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:31.480]   but you're going to see more of,
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:32.880]   which is called orthosomnia.
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:37.200]   So that is a term that is, people are growing concerned over,
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:41.760]   which is wearables and sleep trackers causing sleep issues.
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:44.840]   So people basically become too obsessed
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:46.640]   with optimizing, maximizing scores.
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:49.560]   And that alone, well, actually it's actually,
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:50.920]   so you learn when to wake up.
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:53.600]   So you have actually an anticipatory response
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:55.920]   when many hours prior to waking up.
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:58.040]   So if you actually learn to have a little bit of a,
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:00.720]   what's that little molecule of like excitement and reward,
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:03.080]   oh, dopamine, that's the one.
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:04.600]   If you start getting that 'cause you wake up
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:07.880]   and you get super excited to check your score
[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:09.000]   or your phone, it's the same thing
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.240]   if you check your phone or Twitter
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:11.620]   or whatever and immediately morning,
[02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:14.680]   that'll actually start carving back your wake up time
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:15.680]   because you start launching it.
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:18.600]   So it can ruin sleep becoming too obsessed.
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:22.240]   So what I'll say is if you're going to use a sleep tracker
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:23.240]   and you just like don't care,
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:25.940]   you wanna check it and you have fun with it, great.
[02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:28.360]   But if like you are really, really, really interested in it
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:29.600]   and you pay a lot of attention to it,
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:30.920]   don't check your sleep score
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:33.840]   for at least the first 60 minutes after waking up
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:35.960]   and then that should help you.
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:37.040]   - That's a great tool.
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:40.180]   I think they'll, and piece of advice, I think generally,
[02:15:40.180 --> 02:15:42.000]   because I think a lot of people are waking up
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.120]   in the middle of the night, checking their phone
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:44.720]   two or three times per night.
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:46.240]   I'm kind of wondering why they're doing that
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:48.920]   and I'm guessing it's this anticipatory wake up circuit.
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:51.800]   - Yeah, you absolutely should use either your night mode
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:54.520]   or do not disturb or airplane mode or something overnight.
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:55.680]   - Or leave it out of the room.
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:56.940]   - Yeah, I mean, if you have to wake up
[02:15:56.940 --> 02:16:00.760]   and like some people have like a family member
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:02.120]   who's maybe not in great health
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:03.240]   and so they have to get their phone around
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:05.440]   in case they call or things like that.
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:07.560]   So I get it, you're like, I can't leave it out.
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:09.460]   Leave it in there, leave it in, do not disturb
[02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:12.020]   and enter in their phone number or whoever's phone number
[02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:14.040]   so only they can get through it, but keep it black and white.
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:16.360]   So if you do have to look at your phone at night,
[02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:19.000]   you see black and white and you do not have notifications.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.240]   So make sure that there's no notification for no email
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:24.860]   and no DM, like get all that stuff off your screen
[02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:26.680]   and so you look at the, did anybody call?
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:28.280]   Did anybody text of importance?
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:30.700]   What time is it?
[02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:32.400]   No emergency going on, black and white,
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:33.560]   okay, right back to sleep.
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:35.100]   So that can help a little bit.
[02:16:35.100 --> 02:16:37.960]   - One of the supplements that I've found is extremely useful
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:40.000]   for being able to fall back asleep
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.360]   if I've woken up in the middle of the night
[02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:45.300]   and for some reason can't and is also very effective
[02:16:45.300 --> 02:16:49.160]   for enhancing sleep when one is ingesting
[02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:53.440]   fewer carbohydrates, an issue that a lot of people run into
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:57.280]   or for people that are fasting for many hours before sleep,
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:16:58.600]   people are trying to not eat anything
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:01.280]   within two to four hours, but is inositol,
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:05.520]   900 milligrams of myoinositol, I find, again,
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:07.720]   this is anecdotal data to be clear,
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:09.760]   that if I wake up in the middle of the night
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:12.920]   and I've taken 900 milligrams of inositol
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:15.480]   before initially falling asleep,
[02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:17.980]   that I fall back asleep much more easily.
[02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:20.360]   So that's why I've added 900 milligrams of inositol
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:22.160]   to my so-called sleep stack.
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:23.680]   I've also tried just taking it alone
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:26.160]   and it works well alone, but it works better, of course,
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:29.820]   with the Mag-3 and 8 Apigen and Athenian sleep stack.
[02:17:29.820 --> 02:17:34.400]   Also in terms of tools for sleep,
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:38.120]   the app Reverie that was developed by my colleague,
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:39.960]   Dr. David Spiegel, who's a medical doctor
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:41.200]   at Stanford Psychiatry,
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:43.280]   Stanford School of Medicine Psychiatry,
[02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:44.760]   there is a free trial.
[02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:47.880]   There's a nominal cost if you use it month to month,
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:52.580]   but the data are really strong that people that use that,
[02:17:52.580 --> 02:17:56.640]   I think it's eight to 11 minutes sleep hypnosis once a week,
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:58.120]   and it doesn't have to be in the middle of the night
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:01.840]   when you wake up, really helps improve people's ability
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:04.200]   to fall asleep quickly, stay asleep, fall back asleep
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:05.720]   if they wake up in the middle of the night,
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:07.260]   in some cases, curing insomnia.
[02:18:07.260 --> 02:18:09.200]   In other cases, really just helping people
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:10.760]   with their general sleep issues.
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:13.760]   And I mention this because obviously it's the technology,
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:14.600]   it's not a supplement,
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:16.500]   but I know that some people are supplement-averse.
[02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:19.040]   Also, if you look at the cost comparison
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:23.920]   between taking the sleep stack and the Reverie app,
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:26.560]   it's pennies on the dollar, really.
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:28.980]   So again, I'm a proponent of both for myself,
[02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:31.080]   but I realized that people have varying budgets.
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:35.280]   And again, I should say, as always, behavioral tools first.
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:37.840]   And I think of the Reverie app as more or less
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:39.280]   a behavioral tool.
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:42.920]   - Yeah, it's really just a tool.
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:47.320]   Any of these breathwork protocols, hypnosis protocols,
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:49.860]   they're just a tool for you to touch back in
[02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:51.060]   with your own physiology,
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:53.880]   rather than a substance that's coming in.
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:55.380]   So I fully support those.
[02:18:55.380 --> 02:19:00.380]   We have used a number of those in protocols.
[02:19:00.380 --> 02:19:03.340]   There's some other tricks that we can pull in those areas.
[02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:05.700]   I probably shouldn't say this,
[02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:08.920]   but the reality of it is, depending on what's keeping you up,
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:12.000]   sometimes we recommend just getting up and getting it done.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:17.900]   Like if it's a project or a thing or whatever,
[02:19:17.900 --> 02:19:20.480]   like sometimes, rather than laying there all night
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:22.500]   not sleeping, you can get up, get it done,
[02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:23.840]   and then if you stay awake, fine,
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:25.960]   at least the anxiety is gone.
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:27.640]   Or sometimes you can actually go back to sleep
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:29.000]   'cause you're like, especially if the task
[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.400]   only literally would take like 10 or 15 minutes.
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:34.620]   It may ruin your sleep, but you're gonna have
[02:19:34.620 --> 02:19:38.760]   ruined sleep anyways, so you can try that tool.
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:40.140]   You don't wanna pull that card very often,
[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:41.580]   and you have to be very careful
[02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:45.040]   with what you consider to be something worthy of doing that.
[02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:47.800]   But that is between me and you and nobody else here.
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:50.460]   That's a tool I have used personally more than a few times,
[02:19:50.460 --> 02:19:53.460]   where it's just like, I get an idea and I don't lose it,
[02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:56.140]   or the solution for something you've been doodling on
[02:19:56.140 --> 02:19:57.560]   for a long time pops in your head,
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:00.340]   and you're not wanting to forget it.
[02:20:00.340 --> 02:20:03.840]   Just get up, get it done, and get on with your day.
[02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:05.120]   - In several previous episodes,
[02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:08.280]   you emphasized how exercise induces various adaptations
[02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:09.820]   depending on the type, specificity,
[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:13.380]   volume, intensity, et cetera, of the exercise.
[02:20:13.380 --> 02:20:17.460]   And that during exercise, the degree of adaptation
[02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:20.540]   that one triggers is often associated with things
[02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:22.000]   that normally we don't associate
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:23.860]   with exercise-related health.
[02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:27.260]   Things like huge increases in blood pressure
[02:20:27.260 --> 02:20:31.940]   during exercise, huge increases in inflammatory markers,
[02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:35.520]   muscle damage, and these things all sound terrible,
[02:20:35.520 --> 02:20:38.580]   but as you beautifully explained,
[02:20:38.580 --> 02:20:40.220]   all of that triggers adaptations
[02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:43.620]   that then bring those markers below the baseline
[02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:45.780]   with which they were previous to the exercise.
[02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:48.540]   So that's the adaptation and the recovery.
[02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:50.420]   Within the realm of supplementation and nutrition,
[02:20:50.420 --> 02:20:52.740]   I'm aware of a number of things,
[02:20:52.740 --> 02:20:56.940]   some herbal, some lipid-based, other compounds,
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:20:59.660]   that are used for various things,
[02:20:59.660 --> 02:21:03.460]   but that are known to have a potent anti-inflammatory effect.
[02:21:03.460 --> 02:21:06.700]   Things like omega-3 fatty acids,
[02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:08.980]   ashwagandha for its effect on cortisol,
[02:21:08.980 --> 02:21:11.940]   although that's a bit indirect to the inflammatory pathway,
[02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:16.340]   curcumin, and things of that sort.
[02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:19.800]   Given that we want inflammation
[02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:23.060]   in order to trigger the adaptation response to exercise,
[02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:27.140]   and given that we want to reduce inflammation
[02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:28.980]   in the recovery period,
[02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:30.620]   can we put together a logical framework
[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:34.780]   as to when is best to take anything anti-inflammatory,
[02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:36.460]   whether it's supplement-based or prescription
[02:21:36.460 --> 02:21:37.580]   or over-the-counter drug,
[02:21:37.580 --> 02:21:39.420]   and when to strictly avoid
[02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:42.260]   taking any anti-inflammatory supplement
[02:21:42.260 --> 02:21:45.700]   or behavioral tool?
[02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:47.780]   You mentioned ice can reduce inflammation.
[02:21:47.780 --> 02:21:50.220]   That's why you don't want to do it too close to exercise.
[02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:52.340]   Anyway, I think you get the gist of the question.
[02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:55.860]   What about specific supplements related to inflammation
[02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:57.860]   and anti-inflammatory responses?
[02:21:57.860 --> 02:21:59.260]   What are the best ones?
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:00.660]   When should we take them?
[02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:01.860]   When should we avoid taking them?
[02:22:01.860 --> 02:22:04.540]   - The way that I think about it is understanding
[02:22:04.540 --> 02:22:06.420]   what we call the fitness fatigue model.
[02:22:06.420 --> 02:22:07.540]   So what I mean by that is,
[02:22:07.540 --> 02:22:09.580]   whenever you do some sort of insult,
[02:22:09.580 --> 02:22:11.580]   the whole idea is for you to come back
[02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:12.420]   and get an adaptation.
[02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:14.540]   Now, recovery is not adaptation, right?
[02:22:14.540 --> 02:22:15.620]   Recovery is recovery.
[02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:18.340]   Adaptation is what happens after you're recovered, right?
[02:22:18.340 --> 02:22:20.020]   So there's a very important distinction there.
[02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:22.140]   Fitness fatigue model says basically you've done something
[02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:25.380]   and you've got an adaptation and you've enhanced fitness.
[02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:26.460]   And by fitness, in this case,
[02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:28.980]   I mean it as a nonspecific term.
[02:22:28.980 --> 02:22:32.380]   So you got stronger, you've improved your endurance,
[02:22:32.380 --> 02:22:34.660]   like whatever thing you're trying to train for.
[02:22:34.660 --> 02:22:38.020]   At the same time, though, your fatigue elevated.
[02:22:38.020 --> 02:22:40.220]   So what happens is if fitness increases
[02:22:40.220 --> 02:22:43.100]   at the same or similar rate as fatigue,
[02:22:43.100 --> 02:22:45.620]   your performance actually isn't any better.
[02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:48.180]   And so you may think, "Oh, my program isn't working.
[02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:50.200]   "I need to then train harder,
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:52.380]   "or I need to take more anti-inflammatory,"
[02:22:52.380 --> 02:22:53.960]   or whatever the things are.
[02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:56.220]   When in reality, all you really need to do
[02:22:56.220 --> 02:22:57.660]   is reduce fatigue.
[02:22:57.660 --> 02:23:00.820]   And if you do that, your performance will increase
[02:23:00.820 --> 02:23:03.380]   and all the training adaptations will be actualized.
[02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:05.320]   So the way that we do that is a couple of things.
[02:23:05.320 --> 02:23:07.280]   First and foremost is actually a taper.
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:10.200]   So the first step I think of,
[02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:11.660]   if someone is training very, very hard
[02:23:11.660 --> 02:23:13.460]   and you're not seeing any results,
[02:23:13.460 --> 02:23:15.820]   and we want to think about supplementation,
[02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:18.220]   before I get there, I want to think about taper and deload.
[02:23:18.220 --> 02:23:20.240]   If you're actually training hard and sleep
[02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:22.520]   and everything else is taken care of.
[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:25.420]   So just without going too far into taper,
[02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:27.880]   some general parameters there.
[02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:30.440]   You want to think about about a 50% reduction
[02:23:30.440 --> 02:23:34.100]   in training volume over the course of about a week
[02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:36.480]   for every eight weeks of training.
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:38.280]   Super, super rough, right?
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:39.420]   So if you've been training hard
[02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:41.900]   for three months for something,
[02:23:41.900 --> 02:23:44.340]   you might want to taper for two weeks.
[02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:45.360]   Something like that, right?
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:47.560]   It's sort of a rough estimate.
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:51.280]   That taper, you actually don't need to reduce intensity
[02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:52.920]   because intensity is not the driver of fatigue.
[02:23:52.920 --> 02:23:54.080]   It tends to be volume.
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:56.200]   So as long as your volume is reduced by 50%,
[02:23:56.200 --> 02:23:57.700]   you can maintain intensity.
[02:23:57.700 --> 02:23:58.780]   You can maintain, in fact,
[02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:01.600]   I generally would recommend maintaining frequency.
[02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:03.120]   So if you're used to working out four days a week,
[02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:03.960]   keep it four days a week.
[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:06.260]   You can go down a little bit in frequency,
[02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:07.900]   but if you go down too much in frequency,
[02:24:07.900 --> 02:24:10.160]   you actually tend to feel super lethargic.
[02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:11.440]   So I wouldn't do that.
[02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:13.820]   If you do those things correctly,
[02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:16.360]   you can typically see somewhere between like a three
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:20.220]   to 8% improvement in performance within a matter of days.
[02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:22.840]   So it's important to do that.
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:26.200]   We actually ran a study on cross-country runners years ago,
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:29.640]   testing on a metabolic heart, muscle biopsies,
[02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:30.740]   blood, a whole bunch of things,
[02:24:30.740 --> 02:24:33.440]   and we did it pre and post three weeks of taper.
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:34.480]   And we actually, this is cool
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:36.240]   because we did this in competitive season.
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:38.320]   So these were collegiate cross-country runners,
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:40.080]   and we got them to come to our lab
[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:42.440]   three weeks before their conference championship,
[02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:44.520]   ran them all through a bunch of testing, biopsied them.
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:45.840]   They went through their three-week taper,
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:46.960]   and then we biopsied them again,
[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:48.800]   and then they went and ran
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:50.680]   their conference championships and stuff.
[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:52.180]   Well, what happened was they ended up
[02:24:52.180 --> 02:24:54.000]   hitting about a 50% reduction,
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.400]   because what they did is they took out
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:56.980]   what we call the junk volume.
[02:24:56.980 --> 02:24:58.200]   So they kept their race tempos
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:00.080]   to high-intensity stuff in there.
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:01.160]   They kept their recovery stuff,
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:03.960]   and then at medium pace, they just basically reduced.
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:06.600]   Now, they were terrified, as any endurance runner
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:10.080]   or endurance athlete or participant would understand,
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:12.760]   when you take volume away, they tend to get very nervous.
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:14.880]   And so they didn't like that.
[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:18.280]   But as a result of that, what we saw is their VO2 max,
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:21.000]   despite the fact that they covered half the mileage,
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.420]   their VO2 max did not go down
[02:25:23.420 --> 02:25:25.300]   in three weeks of reduced taper.
[02:25:25.300 --> 02:25:27.960]   Your fitness is extremely stable.
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:30.840]   And in fact, once we actually looked at their data,
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:32.880]   the enzymes and their muscle were responsible
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:35.720]   for oxidative metabolism were maintained.
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:38.120]   And so you don't have to worry about losing,
[02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:40.420]   again, fitness when we're talking about overall performance,
[02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:45.020]   or even oxygen capacity, mitochondrial function, et cetera.
[02:25:45.020 --> 02:25:46.180]   That was all preserved.
[02:25:46.180 --> 02:25:48.520]   Obviously, we saw performance go up.
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:50.520]   What was actually really interesting is we saw,
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:54.400]   I think it was around a 10% increase in type two,
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:57.140]   which are fast twitch muscle fiber size.
[02:25:57.140 --> 02:26:01.460]   So we saw a 10% increase in fast twitch fiber size
[02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:04.280]   at the end of three weeks of tapering.
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:07.580]   Now, what you may think is like, wow,
[02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:09.640]   I guess tapering is anabolic,
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:10.820]   but that's probably not what happened.
[02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:12.380]   What realistically probably happened
[02:26:12.380 --> 02:26:14.800]   was their volume of training
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:17.860]   was actually causing their fibers to be reduced in size.
[02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:19.800]   And then once we removed that fatigue,
[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:22.220]   they just recovered back to normal.
[02:26:22.220 --> 02:26:24.200]   So that's a good example of what I'm talking about.
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:26.400]   Once you remove the fatigue,
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:28.340]   you can actually see enhances in performance,
[02:26:28.340 --> 02:26:29.680]   not because you're necessarily getting better,
[02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:31.640]   but because you're removing the stimuli
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:32.980]   by suppressing you.
[02:26:32.980 --> 02:26:34.700]   So that being said,
[02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:37.100]   the way that you want to think about recovery like this
[02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:40.860]   is although recovery, especially like injury recovery,
[02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:44.300]   like seems chaotic, biology is very organized
[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:46.940]   and there's a very specific three-step process
[02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:48.660]   that you're going to go through for recovery.
[02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:50.040]   And then there are different supplements
[02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:52.580]   that can help you in each of those three areas.
[02:26:52.580 --> 02:26:56.180]   So area one is basically inflammation.
[02:26:56.180 --> 02:26:59.460]   So this is when the cytokine storm comes rolling out,
[02:26:59.460 --> 02:27:01.380]   it starts signaling the injuries there,
[02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:03.340]   in this case, even if it's muscle damage,
[02:27:03.340 --> 02:27:05.300]   and activates immune system to kick on
[02:27:05.300 --> 02:27:07.960]   and that whole repair process happens there.
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:10.580]   What you're trying to do effectively,
[02:27:10.580 --> 02:27:12.860]   in fact, this is why you probably ever wonder
[02:27:12.860 --> 02:27:15.060]   like why is inflammation a thing?
[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:17.900]   What you're trying to do is bring in fluid,
[02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:20.340]   enhance the size and increase blood flow in
[02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:22.020]   so that you can get nutrients for repair
[02:27:22.020 --> 02:27:24.180]   and immune cells and everything like that in the system
[02:27:24.180 --> 02:27:25.420]   and get the waste out.
[02:27:25.420 --> 02:27:27.180]   So short-term inflammation,
[02:27:27.180 --> 02:27:28.740]   even in the case of muscle soreness
[02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:31.860]   is the example we talked about in the previous episode,
[02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:34.740]   but any inflammation, it is part of the necessary process.
[02:27:34.740 --> 02:27:37.380]   That's why you would not want to take an anti-inflammatory
[02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:38.580]   in that state.
[02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:40.500]   And so why you also would not want to do things
[02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:42.080]   like an ice bath.
[02:27:42.080 --> 02:27:45.640]   So in that immediate inflammatory response time window,
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:48.740]   this is seconds to hours after training,
[02:27:48.740 --> 02:27:51.640]   you would want to stay away from things like that.
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:54.700]   A good option here are things like omega-3s.
[02:27:54.700 --> 02:27:56.660]   Good evidence somewhere in the neighborhood
[02:27:56.660 --> 02:27:59.520]   of like two to five grams total,
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:04.520]   typically like a one-to-one EPA to DHA ratio is fine.
[02:28:04.700 --> 02:28:07.840]   Similarly, this is another example of when good
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:09.900]   doesn't mean more is better.
[02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:11.860]   'Cause for example, there is actually evidence
[02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:16.860]   showing up to 15 grams will harm the immune response.
[02:28:16.860 --> 02:28:18.380]   And so you don't just want to be like,
[02:28:18.380 --> 02:28:19.740]   man, I'm super sore, I'm training harder,
[02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:21.500]   I'm just gonna go to 10 grams a day or more and more.
[02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:24.520]   You're actually causing yourself more of a problem.
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:26.840]   So antioxidants, anti-inflammatories are fine.
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:31.020]   Again, omega-3s in that dosage are a decent thing.
[02:28:31.020 --> 02:28:33.940]   You can also do something like 500 milligrams of curcumin
[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:34.940]   three times a day.
[02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:38.660]   That's gonna be enough to keep you in a decent spot.
[02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:41.000]   There are some other things that you could look up,
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:44.700]   maybe some potential benefit for ginger and buswellia
[02:28:44.700 --> 02:28:46.320]   and some things like that for inflammation.
[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:49.860]   But unless we're in like very specific circumstances
[02:28:49.860 --> 02:28:51.660]   where we have like an injury,
[02:28:51.660 --> 02:28:54.260]   we're probably not going to those areas.
[02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:55.580]   - I just wanted to highlight one thing
[02:28:55.580 --> 02:28:57.460]   that came up in a previous episode.
[02:28:57.460 --> 02:29:00.740]   Some, not all people, but some, including myself,
[02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:03.140]   are very sensitive to curcumin.
[02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:07.300]   It has a very potent effect in reducing DHT,
[02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:11.580]   dehydrotestosterone, and leads to all sorts of clamping
[02:29:11.580 --> 02:29:15.060]   of testosterone-associated positive things.
[02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:18.800]   So I have experienced that myself.
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:20.960]   I've had people write to me and say, "I don't understand.
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:23.040]   "I started taking a supplement.
[02:29:23.040 --> 02:29:25.720]   "Curcumin's supposed to be a great anti-inflammatory.
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:27.440]   "It flatlined my libido.
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:29.380]   "It took away my drive."
[02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:31.220]   And kind of wondering what's going on there.
[02:29:31.220 --> 02:29:34.460]   Those people are very likely to be very DHT-sensitive.
[02:29:34.460 --> 02:29:36.580]   Curcumin, while it's a potent anti-inflammatory,
[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:38.620]   can also potently reduce DHT,
[02:29:38.620 --> 02:29:40.820]   but some people tolerate it quite well
[02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:43.220]   and are hearing this and probably think, "That's ridiculous."
[02:29:43.220 --> 02:29:46.100]   Well, it's certainly substantiated
[02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:48.880]   by the biochemical pathways that curcumin taps into
[02:29:48.880 --> 02:29:51.660]   in the known roles of DHT on libido, aggression,
[02:29:51.660 --> 02:29:53.920]   power output, et cetera, and mood.
[02:29:53.920 --> 02:29:57.780]   So just be wary that A, there's no way to predict this.
[02:29:57.780 --> 02:30:00.180]   One simply has to figure it out empirically,
[02:30:00.180 --> 02:30:03.360]   meaning you have to try and see if you like it or don't.
[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:06.460]   The good news is, is those negative effects on DHT
[02:30:06.460 --> 02:30:08.180]   seem to reverse pretty quickly
[02:30:08.180 --> 02:30:11.860]   after ceasing to take curcumin.
[02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:13.340]   So just a mention of something
[02:30:13.340 --> 02:30:14.580]   that came up in a previous episode,
[02:30:14.580 --> 02:30:17.280]   but in case people didn't hear that segment,
[02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:19.480]   just wanted to highlight those facts.
[02:30:19.480 --> 02:30:22.980]   - Further evidence, I strongly discourage,
[02:30:22.980 --> 02:30:24.940]   strongly discourage taking anything
[02:30:24.940 --> 02:30:27.460]   in the anti-inflammatory antioxidant realm
[02:30:27.460 --> 02:30:29.900]   unless you actually have a reason to do so.
[02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:31.360]   If you're waking up and you're like,
[02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:34.940]   "Maybe I'm inflamed," it's probably not a good approach.
[02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:36.340]   Let's have a reason to do so.
[02:30:36.340 --> 02:30:38.780]   Step two is actually what we call proliferation,
[02:30:38.780 --> 02:30:40.620]   and that's kind of like the cleanup crew.
[02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:41.980]   That's when you're gonna be going in there
[02:30:41.980 --> 02:30:44.380]   and cleaning out dead cells and debris
[02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:46.860]   and misfolded proteins and things like that.
[02:30:46.860 --> 02:30:51.180]   At this stage, a fantastic evidence-based supplement
[02:30:51.180 --> 02:30:52.220]   is glutamine.
[02:30:52.220 --> 02:30:53.500]   Glutamine, 20 grams a day.
[02:30:53.500 --> 02:30:55.500]   We typically honestly split it up into two dosage,
[02:30:55.500 --> 02:30:57.100]   10 grams morning, 10 grams night.
[02:30:57.100 --> 02:30:58.620]   It's a conditional amino acid,
[02:30:58.620 --> 02:31:01.480]   which means you can make it,
[02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:03.000]   your body can make enough of it at times,
[02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:04.780]   and other times you may wanna support it.
[02:31:04.780 --> 02:31:06.180]   Generally, those conditional times
[02:31:06.180 --> 02:31:08.700]   are things like burn victims,
[02:31:08.700 --> 02:31:12.140]   high stress situations or injury, things like that.
[02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:16.660]   So there isn't also like a ton of downside to glutamine
[02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:20.020]   because it can go through a transamination,
[02:31:20.020 --> 02:31:22.060]   which means your body can take it and say like,
[02:31:22.060 --> 02:31:24.980]   "We don't need anything here for our muscle recovery.
[02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:27.580]   Let's make it into something else and use it."
[02:31:28.580 --> 02:31:29.820]   For whatever else is needed.
[02:31:29.820 --> 02:31:33.900]   So it's kind of another one of these like low risk products.
[02:31:33.900 --> 02:31:37.340]   It's honestly why you see it in a lot of recovery products.
[02:31:37.340 --> 02:31:38.160]   If you're ever wondering like,
[02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:39.520]   "What the heck is that in there?
[02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:40.840]   I don't need amino acids."
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:42.560]   And you're thinking it's like for protein synthesis.
[02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:43.400]   It's really not.
[02:31:43.400 --> 02:31:44.220]   It's because of this,
[02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:47.740]   it is beneficial to this proliferation process.
[02:31:47.740 --> 02:31:50.220]   - I've been taking glutamine for years.
[02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:53.260]   I tend to take it in higher dosages
[02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:54.340]   several times throughout the day
[02:31:54.340 --> 02:31:56.800]   if I'm ever feeling particularly run down.
[02:31:56.800 --> 02:31:58.940]   I know there are decent data, not great,
[02:31:58.940 --> 02:32:01.460]   but decent data on the role of glutamine for leaky gut.
[02:32:01.460 --> 02:32:02.300]   - Totally.
[02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:03.120]   - We're off saying leaky gut.
[02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:04.720]   That's getting a little bit into the realm
[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:08.900]   of like not super well substantiated,
[02:32:08.900 --> 02:32:11.180]   but in the peer reviewed literature,
[02:32:11.180 --> 02:32:13.680]   but a lot of anecdotal data
[02:32:13.680 --> 02:32:17.920]   and certainly some peer reviewed work, but not a ton.
[02:32:17.920 --> 02:32:20.600]   And then there is also growing interest
[02:32:20.600 --> 02:32:22.580]   in the idea that glutamine,
[02:32:22.580 --> 02:32:25.140]   because it can trigger activation of the neurons in the gut
[02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:28.060]   that signal to the dopamine pathway in the brain,
[02:32:28.060 --> 02:32:31.020]   that it can be used to offset sugar cravings.
[02:32:31.020 --> 02:32:34.180]   This is kind of an interesting new and emerging theme,
[02:32:34.180 --> 02:32:36.500]   which makes sense given the biology of the neurons
[02:32:36.500 --> 02:32:40.020]   in the gut that respond to specific amino acids,
[02:32:40.020 --> 02:32:43.060]   including glutamine, essential fatty acids, and sugar.
[02:32:43.060 --> 02:32:47.340]   And because they respond to any and all three of those,
[02:32:47.340 --> 02:32:51.020]   any one or combination of those, I should say,
[02:32:51.020 --> 02:32:52.380]   to trigger this dopamine response.
[02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:56.980]   Some people have taken to a teaspoon or so of glutamine
[02:32:56.980 --> 02:32:58.700]   in some water or other drink
[02:32:58.700 --> 02:32:59.660]   a couple of times throughout the day
[02:32:59.660 --> 02:33:01.160]   as a way to reduce their sugar cravings.
[02:33:01.160 --> 02:33:02.740]   Because what's essentially doing
[02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:05.540]   is it's tricking the pathway into activation
[02:33:05.540 --> 02:33:08.180]   of those neurons through an alternate
[02:33:08.180 --> 02:33:09.780]   ligand receptor interaction.
[02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:12.200]   - Right, also another interesting point.
[02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:15.180]   There are very, I'm trying to think right now
[02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:17.900]   off the top of my head, I can't think of a time,
[02:33:17.900 --> 02:33:20.020]   and I've used glutamine a lot.
[02:33:20.020 --> 02:33:21.900]   I can't think of a time where I've ever heard anybody
[02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:24.540]   come back with any side effect reports.
[02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:25.740]   - I think if you take enough of it,
[02:33:25.740 --> 02:33:27.300]   you can get some gastric distress.
[02:33:27.300 --> 02:33:30.180]   But of course, you take enough of any powdered substance
[02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:32.460]   mixed in water, you're going to get
[02:33:32.460 --> 02:33:34.540]   a gastric distress response.
[02:33:34.540 --> 02:33:36.860]   And what I've noticed about gastric distress
[02:33:36.860 --> 02:33:40.300]   with things like creatine, glutamine,
[02:33:40.300 --> 02:33:41.860]   and even protein powders for that matter,
[02:33:41.860 --> 02:33:45.880]   I use a high quality whey protein powder routinely,
[02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:49.460]   is that if you build up to it over the course of a few days,
[02:33:49.460 --> 02:33:51.620]   then you can get away with using much higher dosages
[02:33:51.620 --> 02:33:52.620]   without any issue.
[02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:55.140]   - Yeah, yeah, beta-alanine is the same thing, by the way.
[02:33:55.140 --> 02:33:56.980]   We sort of talked about that earlier.
[02:33:56.980 --> 02:33:59.220]   If you've ever tried that and you're like,
[02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:02.820]   "Oh my gosh, I feel like I've just rolled around in grass
[02:34:02.820 --> 02:34:04.340]   and my skin is itching everywhere."
[02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:06.500]   - Oh, it's that ants under the skin sensation?
[02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:07.900]   - Yeah, all that stuff.
[02:34:07.900 --> 02:34:09.540]   You can just take a little bit of a lower dosage
[02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:11.480]   and be fine for the most part.
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:13.500]   And then you will build up a tolerance
[02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:16.120]   to that pretty quickly, so you can up that dosage
[02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:16.960]   along the way.
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:19.500]   So what we will oftentimes do there is start at a dosage
[02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:21.800]   that's pretty minimal, like two grams,
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:24.620]   and then every week or so you can go up another gram
[02:34:24.620 --> 02:34:26.860]   until you get to whatever final point you want to be,
[02:34:26.860 --> 02:34:29.440]   five, six grams a day, you know, whatever.
[02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:32.020]   So that's another way you can sort of mitigate that problem.
[02:34:32.020 --> 02:34:34.420]   So the third step in this recovery process,
[02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:36.220]   after inflammation, proliferation,
[02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:37.420]   we're now into remodeling.
[02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:39.280]   And this is when you're actually, you know, quote unquote,
[02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:40.940]   growing back bigger and stronger.
[02:34:40.940 --> 02:34:43.160]   This is where the majority of the repair
[02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:44.420]   is actually taking place.
[02:34:44.420 --> 02:34:47.100]   And at this point, we're basically playing a micronutrient
[02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:48.940]   and macronutrient game, right?
[02:34:48.940 --> 02:34:52.780]   By that I mean, we've talked about basic macronutrients.
[02:34:52.780 --> 02:34:54.880]   One thing to pay attention to.
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:58.900]   Oftentimes if people are hurt, whether they had an injury
[02:34:58.900 --> 02:35:02.100]   or they've had, just they're super sore.
[02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:05.700]   And they are concerned about eating excess calories.
[02:35:05.700 --> 02:35:08.460]   They tend to want to eat less food during this process
[02:35:08.460 --> 02:35:10.360]   'cause they're like, I'm not working out so much,
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:11.920]   so I'm gonna eat less calories.
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:13.540]   Well, one of the things that you have to pay attention to
[02:35:13.540 --> 02:35:18.540]   is injury can increase basal metabolic rate by up to 10%.
[02:35:18.700 --> 02:35:20.820]   So what you want to do in general
[02:35:20.820 --> 02:35:23.100]   is just take your calories up about 10%.
[02:35:23.100 --> 02:35:25.500]   At least that's what I recommend.
[02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:27.220]   If that is an extended period of time,
[02:35:27.220 --> 02:35:29.460]   then yes, you may put on a slight amount
[02:35:29.460 --> 02:35:31.260]   of body fat or something.
[02:35:31.260 --> 02:35:34.700]   But if that also means you come back some percentage faster,
[02:35:34.700 --> 02:35:36.420]   then it's worth the exchange.
[02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:38.060]   So we recommend that.
[02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:41.860]   In terms of your carbohydrate or fat split,
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:43.040]   I'm not super worried about it.
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:44.660]   My general recommendation is just don't make
[02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:48.060]   any major changes relative to what you were doing, right?
[02:35:48.060 --> 02:35:51.180]   Keep yourself pretty much in the same spot.
[02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:52.940]   In terms of protein, this is the big one.
[02:35:52.940 --> 02:35:54.700]   You want to make sure you are absolutely
[02:35:54.700 --> 02:35:56.640]   at one gram per pound of body weight
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:35:58.700]   because we need those amino acids to come in
[02:35:58.700 --> 02:36:01.040]   and start helping with recovery.
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:04.040]   - One gram of protein per pound of body weight
[02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:05.380]   or more or one gram?
[02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:06.740]   - Or more, yeah.
[02:36:06.740 --> 02:36:09.420]   There's gonna be very little downside to having more.
[02:36:09.420 --> 02:36:16.420]   Remember, protein and carbohydrates,
[02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:19.100]   both stimulate insulin.
[02:36:19.100 --> 02:36:20.500]   And remember, insulin is anabolic.
[02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:23.820]   And so we're trying to drive this process of recovery.
[02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:24.720]   That's why you want both.
[02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:27.380]   So you wouldn't want to skimp on carbohydrates in this phase
[02:36:27.380 --> 02:36:28.760]   nor would you want to skimp on protein
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:31.520]   because you need the activation, the drive into the tissue,
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:33.160]   as well as the structure.
[02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:34.860]   Going back to one of our earlier conversations
[02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:36.380]   and at this point in the week,
[02:36:36.380 --> 02:36:37.780]   I honestly can't remember at all
[02:36:37.780 --> 02:36:39.140]   what episode we covered this in,
[02:36:39.140 --> 02:36:43.060]   but I gave an analogy about making a campfire
[02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:46.100]   and using fat and carbohydrates as the wood
[02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:49.740]   and the log and the protein were the metal structure.
[02:36:49.740 --> 02:36:50.900]   So you need that supply.
[02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:55.100]   If you've cleared out in the previous step damaged proteins
[02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:58.060]   and you need to make new ones to recover that process,
[02:36:58.060 --> 02:37:00.600]   you have to have the raw supply and material.
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:02.620]   So you wouldn't want to avoid either one of those things.
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:04.860]   There's actually some indirect inflammation management
[02:37:04.860 --> 02:37:05.980]   that comes from fatty acids,
[02:37:05.980 --> 02:37:08.300]   which you actually sort of alluded to earlier.
[02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:09.940]   I don't think you need to necessarily go crazy.
[02:37:09.940 --> 02:37:12.980]   You don't need to change your fat intake that much.
[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:15.920]   Just don't drop it, depending on where you're at.
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:18.060]   So if you're a little bit of a higher carb,
[02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:19.760]   lower fat person, great.
[02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:21.020]   If you're moderate, great.
[02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:22.840]   If you're the indirect, if you're higher fat,
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:24.760]   lower carb person, awesome.
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:26.700]   Just don't make an extreme change
[02:37:26.700 --> 02:37:28.720]   and try to not be on the extremes
[02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:30.020]   of either one of those ratios.
[02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:32.640]   But the only specific number to pay attention to, again,
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:34.460]   is that protein number.
[02:37:34.460 --> 02:37:36.860]   And if you go a little bit high or even a lot high,
[02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:38.040]   it's totally fine.
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:39.480]   Just don't go low.
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:42.960]   So that's the macronutrient portion of remodeling.
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:45.100]   In terms of micronutrients, to be honest,
[02:37:45.100 --> 02:37:46.680]   you just get your bases covered.
[02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:50.920]   This is when a basic multivitamin is effective.
[02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:52.500]   What you're really trying to look at here
[02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:54.160]   are vitamin A and zinc.
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:55.700]   They actually have independent mechanisms
[02:37:55.700 --> 02:37:56.840]   that are helpful here.
[02:37:56.840 --> 02:37:59.320]   But those are typically covered in most multivitamins.
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:02.840]   So we generally just give people a multivitamin.
[02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:05.140]   Magnesium actually has some benefits here.
[02:38:05.140 --> 02:38:08.160]   Something like six milligrams per kilogram of body weight
[02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:10.060]   is the dosage you're looking for there.
[02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:15.160]   Magnesium citrate probably has the most evidence
[02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:16.240]   in terms of this respect,
[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:18.440]   but it doesn't mean, I actually have no reason
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:20.720]   to think you couldn't use glycinate
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:23.840]   or if you're using another form for sleep,
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:24.840]   that's probably fine.
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:27.280]   I don't know that for sure,
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:28.480]   but I can't think of a reason
[02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:30.400]   why the other forms of magnesium
[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:32.080]   would all of a sudden not work.
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:34.840]   So you could probably choose whichever form you like.
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:36.920]   I'll be at citrate has probably
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:38.760]   the most research in this aspect.
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:41.660]   The only other things you would probably consider here,
[02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:45.040]   three things, calcium might be on your list,
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:46.780]   particularly if you're trying to,
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:48.640]   if you're concerned with some sort of bone injury
[02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:50.780]   and we've sort of gone past like recovery
[02:38:50.780 --> 02:38:52.940]   and we're actually like into injury.
[02:38:52.940 --> 02:38:54.820]   So you'll see that in recovery products occasionally
[02:38:54.820 --> 02:38:55.900]   and that's why.
[02:38:55.900 --> 02:38:58.460]   And then the last two ones of course are vitamin D
[02:38:58.460 --> 02:39:00.800]   and that's pretty well researched.
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:02.860]   And then the last one is actually something
[02:39:02.860 --> 02:39:05.340]   that can help you if you're at this stage
[02:39:05.340 --> 02:39:08.460]   and you still are dealing with a lot of soreness or not.
[02:39:08.460 --> 02:39:09.760]   And that is tart cherry juice.
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:12.420]   And that's actually effective for both DOMS,
[02:39:12.420 --> 02:39:14.380]   muscle injury, muscle soreness,
[02:39:14.380 --> 02:39:15.640]   and actually has another benefit
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:17.020]   of potentially aiding with sleep.
[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:19.340]   So not a bad one to turn to as well.
[02:39:19.340 --> 02:39:22.020]   And there's a number of companies that make these things.
[02:39:22.020 --> 02:39:23.540]   Yeah, and then there's actually more ongoing research
[02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:24.640]   that I know of on those areas,
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:27.280]   but a promising literature we'll say.
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:30.740]   - Not often, but every once in a while on this podcast,
[02:39:30.740 --> 02:39:35.740]   I will solicit social media for questions from the audience
[02:39:35.740 --> 02:39:37.880]   where I should say the audience to be.
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:41.760]   And then ask some of those questions on the fly
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:42.720]   during the podcast.
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:44.540]   I did this with Dr. Lex Friedman.
[02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:47.220]   I'm going to do it with you.
[02:39:47.220 --> 02:39:51.280]   Your goal is to answer each of these questions,
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:52.580]   certainly not all of them,
[02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:55.280]   thousands of them within the last couple of hours,
[02:39:55.280 --> 02:39:57.580]   to answer each of these questions
[02:39:57.580 --> 02:39:59.500]   in three or four sentences.
[02:39:59.500 --> 02:40:01.380]   I certainly won't be counting the number of sentences
[02:40:01.380 --> 02:40:02.500]   that you speak.
[02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:05.020]   So just know that if you want to go over a little bit,
[02:40:05.020 --> 02:40:05.980]   that's fine.
[02:40:05.980 --> 02:40:09.980]   But feel free to refer to your Instagram site
[02:40:09.980 --> 02:40:12.200]   at a future time where you might go more in depth
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:13.920]   or to refer to a study.
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:16.200]   Or if you like, you can also say pass
[02:40:16.200 --> 02:40:18.980]   if you don't think that you can answer the question
[02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:21.040]   succinctly enough for this format.
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:24.440]   And here, the goal is not to put you on the spot.
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:26.060]   The goal is simply to allow the audience
[02:40:26.060 --> 02:40:27.580]   to ask some questions directly.
[02:40:27.580 --> 02:40:30.840]   And I confess I'm looking at these for the first time.
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:33.260]   So I'll try and be quick with my reading.
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:37.740]   Some of these we may have touched on in previous episodes
[02:40:37.740 --> 02:40:38.700]   or in this episode even,
[02:40:38.700 --> 02:40:41.540]   in which case you can just kind of cue us to the reminder.
[02:40:41.540 --> 02:40:45.020]   This is not directly related to supplementation,
[02:40:45.020 --> 02:40:47.160]   but it is related to nutrition.
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:49.260]   And I don't think we touched on this directly.
[02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:51.760]   Can we do intermittent fasting,
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:53.500]   AKA time-restricted feeding,
[02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:57.020]   with keto and still gain muscle mass?
[02:40:57.020 --> 02:40:58.480]   - TBD.
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:02.620]   I am quite clear such study does not exist.
[02:41:02.620 --> 02:41:04.360]   So I don't know.
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:06.940]   I think I've alluded to before
[02:41:06.940 --> 02:41:10.280]   that we did run an intermittent fasting 16/8
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:11.680]   hypertrophy study.
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:13.540]   There was no keto arm.
[02:41:13.540 --> 02:41:15.780]   The results of that study, by the time this comes out,
[02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:17.840]   we'll probably be ready though, I'm not sure.
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:19.100]   So I can't comment on it.
[02:41:19.100 --> 02:41:20.740]   I haven't looked at the data.
[02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:23.020]   But regarding whether or not if you did that with keto or not,
[02:41:23.020 --> 02:41:24.960]   I can't comment scientifically.
[02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:30.500]   - Do you ever prescribe the use of GABA supplements?
[02:41:31.660 --> 02:41:34.900]   - Well, I can't prescribe anything to make sure we're clear.
[02:41:34.900 --> 02:41:36.420]   - But you're a professor, you can profess.
[02:41:36.420 --> 02:41:37.900]   - I can profess.
[02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:42.060]   We generally don't spend too much time on GABA, rarely.
[02:41:42.060 --> 02:41:43.620]   - Is it okay to wait, train fasted,
[02:41:43.620 --> 02:41:45.940]   then not break the fast
[02:41:45.940 --> 02:41:48.420]   and eat for three or four hours after training?
[02:41:48.420 --> 02:41:50.820]   So in other words, train fasted, I do this,
[02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:53.380]   but then also not eat immediately following training
[02:41:53.380 --> 02:41:55.760]   and wait another three to four hours after training.
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:41:57.580]   - Once we have our results
[02:41:57.580 --> 02:41:59.300]   from our intermittent fasting study back,
[02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:01.100]   we will have a better answer here.
[02:42:01.100 --> 02:42:05.020]   My general recommendation as it stands now though,
[02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:09.060]   is as long as your total protein intake is sufficient,
[02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:11.780]   you should be in a decent spot.
[02:42:11.780 --> 02:42:15.980]   - Great, a lot of questions about fasting and training,
[02:42:15.980 --> 02:42:18.620]   just to note that.
[02:42:18.620 --> 02:42:20.340]   Can you train high performance fasted
[02:42:20.340 --> 02:42:24.100]   and how long before you need to refuel the body?
[02:42:24.100 --> 02:42:25.300]   - Yeah, you can certainly do that.
[02:42:25.300 --> 02:42:27.500]   I know of actually many athletes,
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:28.540]   some athletes that will do that,
[02:42:28.540 --> 02:42:30.980]   though the vast majority will not.
[02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:34.580]   As it gets higher and higher in intensity and or duration,
[02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:35.820]   it gets more challenging,
[02:42:35.820 --> 02:42:36.760]   but it really does come down
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:38.220]   to what you did the day before as well.
[02:42:38.220 --> 02:42:41.180]   So if you ate sufficient calories the day before,
[02:42:41.180 --> 02:42:45.180]   didn't train and your glycogen stores are topped off,
[02:42:45.180 --> 02:42:46.500]   you have a fighting chance.
[02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:48.400]   Now the duration part of that equation
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:51.520]   is really kind of dependent upon you.
[02:42:51.520 --> 02:42:54.460]   So are you really talking 30, 45 minutes, 60 minutes?
[02:42:54.460 --> 02:42:56.140]   You're probably fine.
[02:42:56.140 --> 02:42:57.980]   And whether you're out past that in several hours,
[02:42:57.980 --> 02:42:59.280]   you may not be.
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:01.860]   And then the only other comment I would make is,
[02:43:01.860 --> 02:43:03.820]   keep in mind whenever you think about fasting
[02:43:03.820 --> 02:43:07.040]   and any other, let's say against the textbook,
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:08.780]   you know, quote unquote style,
[02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:10.400]   you really, really need to be careful
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:13.360]   in thinking the difference between can I do it
[02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:15.020]   and is it optimal?
[02:43:15.020 --> 02:43:17.660]   So I have absolutely no reason to think
[02:43:17.660 --> 02:43:20.680]   fasting like that would improve performance.
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:22.480]   I only work for the most part with people
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:25.060]   who are trying to perform at the highest level possible.
[02:43:25.060 --> 02:43:26.200]   So I can't think of a scenario
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:29.700]   in which I would go to fasting to try to enhance performance.
[02:43:29.700 --> 02:43:31.460]   So whether or not you can maintain
[02:43:31.460 --> 02:43:33.760]   some level of performance, probably.
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:35.420]   Will it provide any benefit?
[02:43:35.420 --> 02:43:36.980]   I struggle to find scenarios
[02:43:36.980 --> 02:43:39.740]   in which that would actually make you perform better.
[02:43:39.740 --> 02:43:41.380]   - How do different forms of carbohydrates
[02:43:41.380 --> 02:43:42.220]   impact performance?
[02:43:42.220 --> 02:43:43.060]   And then right below it,
[02:43:43.060 --> 02:43:44.880]   another question about carbohydrates,
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:47.300]   which is does carbohydrate cycling work?
[02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:51.540]   So these are two questions from people
[02:43:51.540 --> 02:43:52.940]   that I think don't know one another,
[02:43:52.940 --> 02:43:55.600]   but a lot of questions about carbohydrates and performance,
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:56.660]   which we've touched on.
[02:43:56.660 --> 02:43:59.900]   Anything else that you want to add to that conversation?
[02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:01.080]   - I don't think I really,
[02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:03.380]   maybe you might want to think about
[02:44:03.380 --> 02:44:05.820]   carb loading slash carb cycling.
[02:44:05.820 --> 02:44:08.960]   So carbohydrate loading does help.
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:11.940]   However, a misconception there is it's just, you know,
[02:44:11.940 --> 02:44:14.660]   a big bowl of pasta the night before.
[02:44:14.660 --> 02:44:16.060]   That can help top off storages,
[02:44:16.060 --> 02:44:18.100]   but really optimal carbohydrate loading
[02:44:18.100 --> 02:44:21.760]   prior to a long duration endurance performance
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:24.740]   is probably best over the course of three or four days.
[02:44:24.740 --> 02:44:27.040]   So you want to gradually increase carbohydrate intake
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:28.420]   for multiple days,
[02:44:28.420 --> 02:44:30.620]   rather than just have one big bowl of pasta.
[02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:35.040]   - Branch chain amino acids
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:38.000]   and essential amino acid supplementation.
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.760]   Yay, nay, or as I would say, meh.
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:42.700]   - Meh, usually.
[02:44:42.700 --> 02:44:45.560]   If your total protein intake is fine,
[02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:47.820]   then you don't really have a need for them.
[02:44:47.820 --> 02:44:52.180]   If you're, for whatever, any number of valid reasons,
[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:53.720]   total protein is not,
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:55.420]   then going to an essential amino acid
[02:44:55.420 --> 02:44:58.120]   would be my first step rather than a BCAA.
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:44:58.960]   Now, admittedly,
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:03.440]   we actually do use essential amino acids somewhat regularly
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:05.080]   because it's also sort of like a,
[02:45:05.080 --> 02:45:08.580]   there's no real harm other than if you're price conscious
[02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:10.500]   and you're sort of like, I'm wasting money, that's fine.
[02:45:10.500 --> 02:45:11.880]   The people I work with generally, again,
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:15.780]   that's not a few dollars to maximize.
[02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:16.840]   Recoveries is not that big.
[02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:20.700]   So we will sometimes use that pre-emitter post training
[02:45:20.700 --> 02:45:22.020]   in some circumstances.
[02:45:22.020 --> 02:45:25.900]   Total protein would be a high quality whey,
[02:45:25.900 --> 02:45:27.100]   something like that.
[02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:29.620]   If you can't use whey for whatever reason,
[02:45:29.620 --> 02:45:33.060]   there are plenty of high quality vegan proteins
[02:45:33.060 --> 02:45:34.020]   you could use.
[02:45:34.020 --> 02:45:35.460]   If you want to top all that off though
[02:45:35.460 --> 02:45:37.060]   and add some essential amino acids,
[02:45:37.060 --> 02:45:39.780]   it wouldn't hurt anything and may potentially help slightly.
[02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:43.380]   So you choose based on that algorithm.
[02:45:43.380 --> 02:45:45.700]   - Ah, I was hoping somebody would ask this.
[02:45:45.700 --> 02:45:47.300]   I've touched on it a little bit.
[02:45:47.300 --> 02:45:50.120]   It's a little bit of a loaded question
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:51.100]   the way they phrased it.
[02:45:51.100 --> 02:45:54.080]   So I'm at risk of leading the witness.
[02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:56.940]   Does the mythical anabolic window really exist?
[02:45:56.940 --> 02:45:57.940]   And I'm just laughing 'cause of the way
[02:45:57.940 --> 02:45:58.780]   they posed the question.
[02:45:58.780 --> 02:46:01.700]   They're already telling us what their stance is.
[02:46:01.700 --> 02:46:05.740]   Making it more effective as to create hypertrophy
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:07.880]   to eat within a certain timeframe after working out.
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:10.420]   I'm going to assume that this person genuinely wants to know
[02:46:10.420 --> 02:46:14.700]   whether or not the anabolic window really exists or not
[02:46:14.700 --> 02:46:17.700]   because they refer to it as mythical.
[02:46:17.700 --> 02:46:21.020]   I'm gonna assume that they're suspicious
[02:46:21.020 --> 02:46:21.940]   but what's the deal?
[02:46:21.940 --> 02:46:24.180]   Is the anabolic window a real thing?
[02:46:24.180 --> 02:46:26.460]   - The post-exercise anabolic window is extremely real.
[02:46:26.460 --> 02:46:29.460]   So what this is, you can see more detail
[02:46:29.460 --> 02:46:32.560]   in a number of videos on my YouTube page, I believe.
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:34.660]   It is the idea that you need to,
[02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:37.380]   must consume some sort of nutrients,
[02:46:37.380 --> 02:46:41.380]   specifically, usually protein in some time domain,
[02:46:41.380 --> 02:46:45.880]   30 or 60 minutes post-exercise in order to maximize growth.
[02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:47.240]   So is that window real?
[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:48.080]   Yes.
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:50.720]   Are you hypersensitized to nutrients in that timeframe?
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:51.560]   Yes.
[02:46:51.560 --> 02:46:54.360]   Is it very important that you rehydrate,
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:57.980]   replenish muscle glycogen and rebuild tissue
[02:46:57.980 --> 02:46:59.900]   quickly after you exercise to maximize recovery?
[02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:01.240]   Absolutely.
[02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:04.340]   It's not real though, in the sense that you have to have it
[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:05.820]   within 30 minutes.
[02:47:05.820 --> 02:47:07.740]   In the case of protein, as we talked about a second ago,
[02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:09.420]   your total protein intake throughout the day
[02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:10.320]   is more important.
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:13.500]   Timing though for things like carbohydrate,
[02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:16.460]   especially if you're training multiple times a day,
[02:47:16.460 --> 02:47:17.300]   it is very real.
[02:47:17.300 --> 02:47:19.080]   So it is a very real thing.
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:20.940]   It's just, you may or may not actually care about it.
[02:47:20.940 --> 02:47:23.540]   It may not be important for your context.
[02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:26.620]   Garlic seems like an appropriate question.
[02:47:26.620 --> 02:47:30.460]   What, if any, functional roles does garlic have
[02:47:30.460 --> 02:47:31.700]   in performance?
[02:47:31.700 --> 02:47:33.020]   Garlic's actually really cool.
[02:47:33.020 --> 02:47:36.220]   There's a number of things you can dive into
[02:47:36.220 --> 02:47:37.940]   that are outside of my three to four sentences,
[02:47:37.940 --> 02:47:40.580]   considering I'm at like two and a half probably already.
[02:47:40.580 --> 02:47:44.620]   You're not gonna find strong human data on garlic extract.
[02:47:44.620 --> 02:47:48.020]   However, there is a little bit suggesting
[02:47:48.020 --> 02:47:51.260]   it can actually enhance recovery from injury
[02:47:51.260 --> 02:47:52.460]   or potentially tissue damage.
[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:55.380]   So you gotta kind of be careful though
[02:47:55.380 --> 02:47:57.040]   because in order to understand what's happening,
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:47:58.820]   you have to differentiate between innate
[02:47:58.820 --> 02:48:01.140]   and adaptive recovery processes.
[02:48:01.140 --> 02:48:02.900]   And when we say things like immunity,
[02:48:02.900 --> 02:48:05.820]   realize friends, that's not one thing.
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:07.400]   That's just like a very colloquial term
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:09.160]   for a number of things.
[02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:10.540]   - Again, it's a verb.
[02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:11.820]   Like it's a noun, right?
[02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:16.040]   The immune system, but immunity is a bunch of processes
[02:48:16.040 --> 02:48:18.340]   or processes, if you're about to correct my speech,
[02:48:18.340 --> 02:48:20.380]   I'll correct yours right back.
[02:48:20.380 --> 02:48:22.020]   Not yours, Andy, for the listeners.
[02:48:22.020 --> 02:48:25.700]   Processes, but tomato, tomato, it's a verb.
[02:48:25.700 --> 02:48:27.620]   Immunity is a verb.
[02:48:27.620 --> 02:48:30.840]   - This is my problem with immune boosters.
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:31.680]   Same issue, right?
[02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:34.600]   You're like, well, what are you boosting specifically?
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:37.140]   Because in fact, if you're boosting the wrong part
[02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:41.220]   of immunity during the wrong phase of recovery with garlic,
[02:48:41.220 --> 02:48:45.200]   you may be actually hurting the process
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:47.720]   because you are theoretically could be trying
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:49.020]   to down-regulate that portions
[02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:50.740]   that you can up-regulate the next portion.
[02:48:50.740 --> 02:48:52.820]   That's the faster way to say it, if you will.
[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:56.260]   So we actually, you may see more data come out
[02:48:56.260 --> 02:48:59.560]   that says the garlic extract's overrated.
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:00.400]   I don't know.
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:01.220]   I actually don't even know yet.
[02:49:01.220 --> 02:49:02.640]   We just don't have enough human data on it,
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:04.900]   but yeah, there's some stuff there
[02:49:04.900 --> 02:49:06.500]   if you want to look hard enough.
[02:49:06.500 --> 02:49:10.380]   - I'm going to ask this question for myself
[02:49:10.380 --> 02:49:11.860]   'cause I'm curious to know the answer.
[02:49:11.860 --> 02:49:12.700]   - Selfish.
[02:49:12.700 --> 02:49:14.420]   - Tart cherry extract.
[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:18.340]   Pretty effective, actually, for two things,
[02:49:18.340 --> 02:49:20.780]   potentially aiding in sleep, getting to sleep,
[02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:22.420]   as well as muscle soreness.
[02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:25.620]   That's the bulk of the research is in muscle soreness
[02:49:25.620 --> 02:49:27.720]   and seems to be a moderate effect there.
[02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:30.260]   - I think for people that might be interested
[02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:32.500]   in dosages of things like tart cherry extract,
[02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:37.500]   garlic, et cetera, obviously Dr. Andy Galpin's Instagram
[02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:39.800]   and Twitter are great places to ask questions like that
[02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:42.220]   and to find answers to questions like that,
[02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:46.200]   as well as examine.com is a terrific website.
[02:49:46.200 --> 02:49:49.100]   They actually recently overhauled their entire website,
[02:49:49.100 --> 02:49:50.840]   so they have this human effect matrix
[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:55.000]   that shows the effects and the strength of different effects
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:58.340]   in human studies of many, many different compounds
[02:49:58.340 --> 02:50:03.900]   relating to everything to hormone health in men and women,
[02:50:03.900 --> 02:50:06.100]   sports performance, cognitive performance.
[02:50:06.100 --> 02:50:07.920]   It doesn't cover everything,
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:11.260]   but it certainly covers a lot with links to studies.
[02:50:11.260 --> 02:50:14.700]   There's a lot that's available at completely zero cost.
[02:50:14.700 --> 02:50:17.300]   By joining examine.com,
[02:50:17.300 --> 02:50:19.500]   you can access some additional features.
[02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:20.660]   And this is, by the way,
[02:50:20.660 --> 02:50:22.540]   not a paid endorsement from examine.com.
[02:50:22.540 --> 02:50:26.900]   I'm simply a long-time user of examine.com myself.
[02:50:26.900 --> 02:50:28.880]   And so I just want to cue people to it.
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:31.340]   And again, many of the resources there
[02:50:31.340 --> 02:50:32.960]   are available completely free of cost.
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:34.660]   It's a wonderful site.
[02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:38.400]   So for dosages of garlic, tart cherry extract,
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:39.240]   and things of that sort,
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:40.300]   whether or not you're getting it from food
[02:50:40.300 --> 02:50:43.260]   or you're getting it from extra powders, rather,
[02:50:43.260 --> 02:50:47.700]   all of that information is pretty nicely laid out there.
[02:50:47.700 --> 02:50:49.460]   So unless you have something to add to that,
[02:50:49.460 --> 02:50:51.540]   I was just going to cue people to that resource.
[02:50:51.540 --> 02:50:52.860]   - No, I've been using that
[02:50:52.860 --> 02:50:55.180]   since the first day that website was launched.
[02:50:55.180 --> 02:50:58.220]   I was made aware that it was coming.
[02:50:58.220 --> 02:51:00.820]   Been fortunate to know those guys for a while.
[02:51:00.820 --> 02:51:01.660]   So yeah, I've used it.
[02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:02.700]   I've used it in all my classes.
[02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:07.020]   I use it, I don't even know, probably weekly at this point.
[02:51:07.020 --> 02:51:08.940]   Another nice feature that's actually on there
[02:51:08.940 --> 02:51:11.580]   is they have a series of,
[02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:13.460]   like they'll do some topical reviews, basically.
[02:51:13.460 --> 02:51:16.820]   So they'll write a big paper out on muscle damage
[02:51:16.820 --> 02:51:17.660]   or blood pressure.
[02:51:17.660 --> 02:51:19.560]   - Or testosterone, testosterone enhancement,
[02:51:19.560 --> 02:51:23.900]   or hormone, menstrual cycle, and-
[02:51:23.900 --> 02:51:26.380]   - Yeah, PCOS, I think they do on and all kinds of stuff.
[02:51:26.380 --> 02:51:28.220]   So you can search by topic,
[02:51:28.220 --> 02:51:30.660]   like energy or recovery or whatever,
[02:51:30.660 --> 02:51:33.420]   or you can search by black cumin seed extract
[02:51:33.420 --> 02:51:35.580]   or like whatever number of things you want to do.
[02:51:35.580 --> 02:51:36.420]   And they'll also tell you
[02:51:36.420 --> 02:51:38.300]   if there's any interactions to pay attention to.
[02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:39.220]   So it's really, really nice.
[02:51:39.220 --> 02:51:42.980]   So be carefully predicting A and B or whatever.
[02:51:42.980 --> 02:51:45.420]   So yeah, it's wonderful, wonderful.
[02:51:45.420 --> 02:51:47.100]   - Yeah, they've done a marvelous job.
[02:51:47.100 --> 02:51:48.700]   So thank you, examine.com.
[02:51:48.700 --> 02:51:50.740]   Keep up the amazing work.
[02:51:50.740 --> 02:51:53.300]   Well, we've come close to the end of this episode.
[02:51:53.300 --> 02:51:56.900]   And that means that we're close to the end of this series
[02:51:56.900 --> 02:51:58.800]   where you have so graciously joined us
[02:51:58.800 --> 02:52:01.900]   for six full episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[02:52:01.900 --> 02:52:06.900]   to educate us on all things fitness.
[02:52:07.100 --> 02:52:10.580]   Episode one, you reviewed and educated us
[02:52:10.580 --> 02:52:13.000]   on assessing our level of fitness.
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.980]   In fact, I learned so many ways of assessing fitness
[02:52:15.980 --> 02:52:17.780]   that I had not thought about,
[02:52:17.780 --> 02:52:22.060]   and also assessing my recovery capacity, for instance.
[02:52:22.060 --> 02:52:23.820]   One thing that I'm definitely going to implement
[02:52:23.820 --> 02:52:28.740]   from that episode is a routine broad jump test,
[02:52:28.740 --> 02:52:32.940]   and an in-home high jump, jump and touch test.
[02:52:32.940 --> 02:52:34.260]   If people don't know what I'm referring to,
[02:52:34.260 --> 02:52:36.700]   that's all contained in that episode, it's timestamped.
[02:52:36.700 --> 02:52:40.180]   These are very straightforward, zero cost ways
[02:52:40.180 --> 02:52:42.400]   to assess one's level of fitness.
[02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:44.880]   There are a few others that require a bare minimum
[02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:46.720]   of technology, like taking your pulse rate
[02:52:46.720 --> 02:52:49.480]   in very specific ways at specific times.
[02:52:49.480 --> 02:52:53.420]   Also some timing of mile runs and some other things
[02:52:53.420 --> 02:52:56.180]   related to strength and hypertrophy and on and on.
[02:52:56.180 --> 02:53:00.640]   Really, it's a buffet of options that we can select from.
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:02.660]   And I already know the four or five
[02:53:02.660 --> 02:53:05.300]   that I started implementing this week.
[02:53:05.300 --> 02:53:08.280]   I've recognized how I'm pretty good in a couple of areas.
[02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:13.620]   I'm doing maybe, maybe better than pretty well in one area,
[02:53:13.620 --> 02:53:16.380]   but then I'm doing abysmally poorly
[02:53:16.380 --> 02:53:19.100]   in a few areas that I just wasn't aware of.
[02:53:19.100 --> 02:53:21.920]   And so I've already started taking on ways
[02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:25.700]   to adjust that over time, and I'll keep people posted.
[02:53:25.700 --> 02:53:28.140]   So that first episode was absolutely incredible,
[02:53:28.140 --> 02:53:30.540]   and just provides so much actionable knowledge
[02:53:30.540 --> 02:53:32.360]   and the rationale behind it.
[02:53:32.360 --> 02:53:34.900]   The second episode, you educated us about strength,
[02:53:34.900 --> 02:53:37.020]   speed, and hypertrophy training.
[02:53:37.020 --> 02:53:41.040]   And there too, an immense amount of incredible knowledge.
[02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:43.900]   We got way down into the details.
[02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:47.260]   You explained sets, reps, the rationale for sets, reps,
[02:53:47.260 --> 02:53:51.140]   rest, cadence, number of workouts per week.
[02:53:51.140 --> 02:53:52.660]   I'm definitely gonna take away my need
[02:53:52.660 --> 02:53:54.340]   to do some speed-based training
[02:53:54.340 --> 02:53:55.880]   and some power-based training.
[02:53:55.880 --> 02:53:58.940]   Normally, I think in terms of strength or hypertrophy,
[02:53:58.940 --> 02:54:01.740]   and I'm relieved to learn that a lot of the speed
[02:54:01.740 --> 02:54:04.940]   and power-based training, it's low intensity enough
[02:54:04.940 --> 02:54:06.220]   that it can be done fairly often
[02:54:06.220 --> 02:54:08.240]   and incorporated into my program,
[02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:11.280]   which already touches on strength and hypertrophy,
[02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:13.300]   and indeed some endurance work as well.
[02:54:13.300 --> 02:54:15.820]   So amazing tips that you provided there.
[02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:18.420]   I'm certainly going to implement the three to five program
[02:54:18.420 --> 02:54:21.740]   that you described, three to five exercises
[02:54:21.740 --> 02:54:24.220]   done for three to five repetitions,
[02:54:24.220 --> 02:54:28.700]   three to five minutes between sets.
[02:54:28.700 --> 02:54:30.380]   You're doing this three to five times per week,
[02:54:30.380 --> 02:54:31.220]   and so on and so forth.
[02:54:31.220 --> 02:54:33.420]   All the details, again, time-stamped
[02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:36.540]   in the strength and hypertrophy episode show notes,
[02:54:36.540 --> 02:54:37.460]   so just incredible.
[02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:40.100]   - We even used that to set up PR with you this week.
[02:54:40.100 --> 02:54:43.540]   - That's right, I did PR this week thanks to your input
[02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:45.180]   and following that program,
[02:54:45.180 --> 02:54:47.260]   and I'm really grateful for that.
[02:54:47.260 --> 02:54:49.620]   It does feel good to break through a barrier,
[02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:52.600]   and I intend to break through more barriers,
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:54.100]   but not just with strength and hypertrophy
[02:54:54.100 --> 02:54:58.000]   because episode three, you taught us all about endurance,
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:54:59.860]   the four different forms of endurance,
[02:54:59.860 --> 02:55:02.380]   how to train for each of those different forms,
[02:55:02.380 --> 02:55:07.100]   the value of doing even very brief 20 second sprints
[02:55:07.100 --> 02:55:08.980]   or bouts of jumping jacks throughout the day,
[02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:12.260]   which to some people might just sound like a little hack
[02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:14.280]   or a gimmick, but no, these are actually tapping
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:18.060]   into fuel systems and modes of neuromuscular interactions
[02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:19.940]   that greatly aid other forms of endurance
[02:55:19.940 --> 02:55:22.020]   like long duration endurance.
[02:55:22.020 --> 02:55:25.580]   I would love to return to my high school mile time.
[02:55:25.580 --> 02:55:26.700]   I won't reveal what that is
[02:55:26.700 --> 02:55:28.480]   'cause this is not really about me,
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:31.500]   but I plan to start doing, if not mile repeats,
[02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:36.040]   then doing some mile runs and testing there once a week.
[02:55:36.040 --> 02:55:38.600]   You laid out a beautiful program for how to do that,
[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:42.740]   and then in the next episode, you wowed us again
[02:55:42.740 --> 02:55:45.960]   with a description of the science and the tools
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:47.860]   and this right down to the details,
[02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:51.520]   but all laid out very cleanly and clearly
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:54.480]   as to how to design an optimal fitness program.
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:56.620]   What are the things that really represent
[02:55:56.620 --> 02:56:00.000]   an optimal program, what questions does one have to answer
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:01.920]   before designing a program?
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:04.000]   What are some of the barriers in the way?
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.880]   This concept of defenders as things that prevent you
[02:56:06.880 --> 02:56:09.320]   from reaching your goals, and one of the key things,
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:11.040]   I have it right here in front of me
[02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:12.280]   that I took away from that episode
[02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:17.120]   was this quadrant approach of really thinking about
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:19.720]   and figuring out how much one intends to devote
[02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:22.820]   to work career calling, let's make that one bin,
[02:56:22.820 --> 02:56:26.600]   relationships, another bin, fitness in the other bin,
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:27.840]   and recovery in the other bin,
[02:56:27.840 --> 02:56:31.440]   and here we'll tip our hat to our good friend, Kenny Kane,
[02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:35.840]   for mentioning that overall scheme for doing things.
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:38.980]   It's been immensely useful, and I've actually charted it out
[02:56:38.980 --> 02:56:41.380]   and thought about and drawn out which different things
[02:56:41.380 --> 02:56:42.680]   fall into each of these categories.
[02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:44.360]   You might think it's obvious, okay, relationships,
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:45.600]   but that includes a lot of different things,
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:48.120]   and there's crossover between these bins
[02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:51.120]   in terms of how you can combine enhancing relationships
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:53.700]   with fitness, work, recovery, and so on.
[02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:56.860]   So that episode is just, again, a treasure trove
[02:56:56.860 --> 02:56:59.420]   of knowledge, and then in the next episode,
[02:56:59.420 --> 02:57:03.420]   you educated us on recovery in all its forms
[02:57:03.420 --> 02:57:06.380]   in the very short term within the workout,
[02:57:06.380 --> 02:57:09.360]   immediately after the workout, and from workout to workout,
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:12.580]   ways to really accelerate recovery, assess recovery,
[02:57:12.580 --> 02:57:15.180]   and as you pointed out, for people like me
[02:57:15.180 --> 02:57:17.460]   who always assume that we don't recover very well
[02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:19.700]   and that's some sort of character trait
[02:57:19.700 --> 02:57:21.820]   or nervous system thing or genetic,
[02:57:21.820 --> 02:57:24.360]   to really think about how my training is impacting
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:26.460]   my level of recovery, and in doing so,
[02:57:26.460 --> 02:57:29.340]   it's revealed to me that I have far more capacity
[02:57:29.340 --> 02:57:31.780]   than I thought I had, and already this week,
[02:57:31.780 --> 02:57:35.980]   I've managed to train more often, doing more work,
[02:57:35.980 --> 02:57:38.920]   and I feel better than ever, and that's also,
[02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:41.160]   despite the fact that we've spent a fair amount of time
[02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:42.620]   in these chairs across from one another.
[02:57:42.620 --> 02:57:44.340]   - That's a kind way to say it.
[02:57:44.340 --> 02:57:49.340]   - Well, it's been a pleasure, and then in today's episode,
[02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:52.500]   you explained nutrition and supplementation
[02:57:52.500 --> 02:57:54.320]   as it relates to performance, and of course,
[02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:58.860]   that touches into recovery, but also optimal mental states
[02:57:58.860 --> 02:58:01.340]   for training, how to approach one's training,
[02:58:01.340 --> 02:58:03.640]   and how to extract the most from training
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:06.620]   through quality nutrition, so what to eat and when,
[02:58:06.620 --> 02:58:09.020]   which carbohydrates, protein amounts,
[02:58:09.020 --> 02:58:12.260]   windows of opportunity, windows you absolutely
[02:58:12.260 --> 02:58:13.780]   don't want to miss, and then some
[02:58:13.780 --> 02:58:17.000]   that are a bit more flexible, and then we went deep
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.660]   into the weeds of magnesium, garlic,
[02:58:19.660 --> 02:58:23.040]   tart cherry extract, alpha GPC, we touched on
[02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:27.040]   neural transmitter-related systems, hormone-related systems,
[02:58:27.040 --> 02:58:28.780]   we went deep into a discussion about sleep,
[02:58:28.780 --> 02:58:30.640]   because of course, sleep is the foundation
[02:58:30.640 --> 02:58:33.000]   for recovery and performance of all kinds,
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:37.140]   emotional, mental, and physical recovery and performance,
[02:58:37.140 --> 02:58:39.460]   and in taking us through this enormous arc
[02:58:39.460 --> 02:58:43.060]   of a journey through fitness, I think it's fair to say
[02:58:43.060 --> 02:58:46.600]   that you've given us your knowledge contained in your head.
[02:58:46.600 --> 02:58:48.340]   I was telling someone just the other day
[02:58:48.340 --> 02:58:51.100]   that one of the things that I always lamented in science
[02:58:51.100 --> 02:58:53.300]   is that I would encounter these incredible professors
[02:58:53.300 --> 02:58:56.820]   and scientists in other domains of life too,
[02:58:56.820 --> 02:58:59.080]   and you just wish there was some way to download their brain
[02:58:59.080 --> 02:59:00.940]   because they had so much knowledge inside them,
[02:59:00.940 --> 02:59:04.820]   and I'm looking for a USB or USB-C port on you,
[02:59:04.820 --> 02:59:07.620]   and I don't see one yet, but what you've effectively done
[02:59:07.620 --> 02:59:10.540]   for us across these six episodes is to download
[02:59:10.540 --> 02:59:13.060]   the actionable knowledge, and it's wonderful,
[02:59:13.060 --> 02:59:15.940]   the information you've provided is clear,
[02:59:15.940 --> 02:59:20.700]   it's super interesting, it's highly, highly actionable,
[02:59:20.700 --> 02:59:23.620]   and in many cases, it's counterintuitive and surprising,
[02:59:23.620 --> 02:59:26.500]   but once one understands the logic behind it,
[02:59:26.500 --> 02:59:29.680]   as you've provided for us also, then it all makes sense
[02:59:29.680 --> 02:59:32.420]   in a way that's extremely satisfying
[02:59:32.420 --> 02:59:34.880]   and extremely motivating, so it's certainly motivating me
[02:59:34.880 --> 02:59:37.580]   to change the way that I train in a number of ways,
[02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:39.780]   and I promise that I'll report back to our audience
[02:59:39.780 --> 02:59:41.660]   and to you as to what my results are,
[02:59:41.660 --> 02:59:46.380]   but really, as we both agree, this is not about me,
[02:59:46.380 --> 02:59:47.560]   this is not about you,
[02:59:47.560 --> 02:59:48.900]   this is really about the people listening,
[02:59:48.900 --> 02:59:50.380]   and so for those of you listening,
[02:59:50.380 --> 02:59:53.800]   I hope you can appreciate what an incredible gift it is
[02:59:53.800 --> 02:59:57.740]   to have somebody of Dr. Andy Galpin's experience
[02:59:57.740 --> 03:00:02.460]   and drive and scholarly background
[03:00:02.460 --> 03:00:04.780]   who also works with athletes and everyday people
[03:00:04.780 --> 03:00:08.660]   just to splay out all this knowledge for us
[03:00:08.660 --> 03:00:13.520]   systematically over six episodes, Dr. Andy Galpin,
[03:00:13.520 --> 03:00:15.720]   thank you ever so much.
[03:00:15.720 --> 03:00:19.680]   - I appreciate that far too kind of words to me.
[03:00:19.680 --> 03:00:21.860]   If you've been following along through this entire journey,
[03:00:21.860 --> 03:00:25.020]   as you called it, you know I like first principles thinking
[03:00:25.020 --> 03:00:28.100]   and I like lists, so I'm going to get you with one more list
[03:00:28.100 --> 03:00:31.420]   and I got five things on this final list.
[03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:33.580]   Get your pen and pad out, please.
[03:00:33.580 --> 03:00:38.580]   Number one, I want to really emphasize science itself
[03:00:38.820 --> 03:00:41.680]   as a verb, which means it's ongoing and changing.
[03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:46.340]   I did my best over the course of these many, many, many hours
[03:00:46.340 --> 03:00:50.020]   to provide my interpretation of the science,
[03:00:50.020 --> 03:00:53.660]   to provide my practical knowledge and things that I use,
[03:00:53.660 --> 03:00:55.740]   but that's fallible.
[03:00:55.740 --> 03:00:58.300]   Science changes, there are many, many things in my career
[03:00:58.300 --> 03:01:02.140]   that I was very sure that the evidence was clear on,
[03:01:02.140 --> 03:01:03.400]   and then it changed.
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:05.580]   So as you move forward, do not think of
[03:01:05.580 --> 03:01:07.680]   any of the recommendations I gave you,
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:11.560]   whether they were about supplement dosages and timing,
[03:01:11.560 --> 03:01:14.940]   rep ranges or breathing tactics, anything in between.
[03:01:14.940 --> 03:01:17.620]   Just use them as guidelines.
[03:01:17.620 --> 03:01:21.620]   So number one, science is a verb.
[03:01:21.620 --> 03:01:25.180]   Number two, I really want to thank the audience.
[03:01:25.180 --> 03:01:27.880]   This has been an extremely long haul.
[03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:31.700]   Some of you have somehow I'm sure, which I'm not sure how,
[03:01:31.700 --> 03:01:32.820]   but some of you have probably made it
[03:01:32.820 --> 03:01:35.060]   through this entire journey and listened to all six episodes
[03:01:35.060 --> 03:01:37.580]   and you should probably get some sort of free
[03:01:37.580 --> 03:01:40.780]   Huberman Lab shirt or something or a plaque or I don't know.
[03:01:40.780 --> 03:01:42.060]   - How about a Galpin plaque?
[03:01:42.060 --> 03:01:43.020]   - Ah, Galpin plaque.
[03:01:43.020 --> 03:01:45.040]   How about an internet high five?
[03:01:45.040 --> 03:01:47.780]   And even if you just dropped in for a few of the episodes,
[03:01:47.780 --> 03:01:49.380]   I appreciate you taking the time.
[03:01:49.380 --> 03:01:51.660]   There's a lot of things you could be doing with your time
[03:01:51.660 --> 03:01:56.620]   and to spend those resources on my words is touching.
[03:01:56.620 --> 03:02:00.300]   Number three, I want to actually thank you, of course,
[03:02:00.300 --> 03:02:02.500]   Andrew and the whole team and the crew up here
[03:02:02.500 --> 03:02:03.740]   for three things.
[03:02:03.740 --> 03:02:08.400]   Number one, I think it's incredibly important
[03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:10.700]   that you have gone out of your way
[03:02:10.700 --> 03:02:12.980]   to give other people credit for their work.
[03:02:12.980 --> 03:02:14.860]   You go out of your way on your large platforms
[03:02:14.860 --> 03:02:16.620]   of social media to tag people,
[03:02:16.620 --> 03:02:18.220]   to give scientists credit for their work
[03:02:18.220 --> 03:02:20.020]   and most people do not do that
[03:02:20.020 --> 03:02:21.820]   and that's something you don't have to do
[03:02:21.820 --> 03:02:24.980]   and I think that is a culture, I know why you do it.
[03:02:24.980 --> 03:02:26.980]   You come from science, that's just what you do.
[03:02:26.980 --> 03:02:28.140]   You give people credit for their work
[03:02:28.140 --> 03:02:30.300]   but you go out of your way to do that
[03:02:30.300 --> 03:02:32.700]   and so I want to thank you for that.
[03:02:32.700 --> 03:02:37.700]   The next one is many people who have outlets and platforms
[03:02:37.700 --> 03:02:40.900]   will try to fill those with people
[03:02:40.900 --> 03:02:43.660]   who are going to grow their platforms.
[03:02:43.660 --> 03:02:44.940]   It doesn't mean these people are wrong or bad
[03:02:44.940 --> 03:02:47.100]   but I think what's extremely special
[03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:48.620]   about what you've created here
[03:02:48.620 --> 03:02:50.200]   is again you have gone out of your way
[03:02:50.200 --> 03:02:53.600]   to bring on the direct source of information.
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:56.540]   I can't even imagine how many of your podcasts, guests,
[03:02:56.540 --> 03:02:58.500]   have never been on a podcast before
[03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:00.500]   or have been on a very short number of them
[03:03:00.500 --> 03:03:02.660]   and you've made an extremely large platform
[03:03:02.660 --> 03:03:06.420]   doing nothing but talking about super deep dork science
[03:03:06.420 --> 03:03:08.780]   directly from the scientists themselves
[03:03:08.780 --> 03:03:10.580]   and to create a community like that,
[03:03:10.580 --> 03:03:14.740]   I'm so happy that science has made it here
[03:03:14.740 --> 03:03:16.780]   and you've shown the world.
[03:03:16.780 --> 03:03:18.140]   People aren't stupid.
[03:03:18.140 --> 03:03:20.340]   People want detail and people want science
[03:03:20.340 --> 03:03:21.740]   and you've given it to them.
[03:03:21.740 --> 03:03:25.420]   And the last one of course,
[03:03:25.420 --> 03:03:26.180]   let's see if I can get through this,
[03:03:26.180 --> 03:03:29.320]   is thank you for what you've done for me in my career.
[03:03:29.320 --> 03:03:33.160]   I understand there could have been any number of people
[03:03:33.160 --> 03:03:34.440]   in this chair.
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:38.080]   To put me on your platform once was incredibly gracious
[03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:42.400]   but to do it for 600 hours or whatever we did in this series
[03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:45.480]   is I can't thank you enough for that opportunity.
[03:03:45.480 --> 03:03:48.120]   So I hope I lived up to it and I had a tremendous time
[03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:50.720]   and thank you for being such a gracious host.
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:54.640]   - Well, you more than exceeded expectations.
[03:03:54.640 --> 03:03:57.620]   You are absolutely the person to be in this chair
[03:03:57.620 --> 03:04:01.620]   talking about these topics with me and for the world.
[03:04:01.620 --> 03:04:05.500]   And once again, I just want to say thank you
[03:04:05.500 --> 03:04:09.980]   as a colleague, as a public educator,
[03:04:09.980 --> 03:04:13.080]   as an exercise scientist and as a friend.

[03:04:40.520 --> 03:04:42.360]   at the beginning and during today's episode.
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:44.780]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[03:04:44.780 --> 03:04:45.760]   I'd also like to inform you
[03:04:45.760 --> 03:04:48.280]   about the Huberman Lab Podcast free newsletter.
[03:04:48.280 --> 03:04:50.080]   It's called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[03:04:50.080 --> 03:04:53.060]   And each month, the Neural Network Newsletter is sent out
[03:04:53.060 --> 03:04:55.520]   and it contains summaries of podcast episodes,
[03:04:55.520 --> 03:04:58.440]   specific protocols discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:04:58.440 --> 03:05:02.280]   all in fairly concise format and all completely zero cost.
[03:05:02.280 --> 03:05:03.980]   You can sign up for the Neural Network Newsletter
[03:05:03.980 --> 03:05:05.700]   by going to HubermanLab.com,
[03:05:05.700 --> 03:05:07.640]   go to the menu and click on newsletter.
[03:05:07.640 --> 03:05:08.660]   You provide us your email.
[03:05:08.660 --> 03:05:10.280]   We do not share it with anybody.
[03:05:10.280 --> 03:05:12.720]   And as I mentioned before, it's completely zero cost.
[03:05:12.720 --> 03:05:14.520]   By going to HubermanLab.com,
[03:05:14.520 --> 03:05:17.280]   you can also go into the menu tab and go to newsletter
[03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:20.040]   and see some example newsletters from months past.
[03:05:20.040 --> 03:05:22.280]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[03:05:22.280 --> 03:05:24.240]   about fitness, exercise, and performance
[03:05:24.240 --> 03:05:25.760]   with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[03:05:25.760 --> 03:05:28.720]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[03:05:28.720 --> 03:05:31.300]   (upbeat music)
