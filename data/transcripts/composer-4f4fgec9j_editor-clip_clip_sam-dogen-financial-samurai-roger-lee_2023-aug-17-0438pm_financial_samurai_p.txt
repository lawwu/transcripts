[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   - Hello everybody, it's Sam from the
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.500]   Financial Samurai Podcast, and in this episode
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.960]   I have a special guest with me, Roger Lee,
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.880]   who founded a company called Human Interest,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.520]   and he's also the founders of layoffs.fyi.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.520]   Welcome to the podcast, Roger.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.000]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.960]   - So I'd love to hear about your journey
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.680]   from college to entrepreneurship,
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.920]   because your background is you went to Harvard
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.200]   and you studied applied mathematics,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.640]   and then you went to Y Combinator,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.640]   and you started a company that turns out was a success.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.320]   So how does one go about that?
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.560]   And first of all, how did you get into Harvard,
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.760]   and why did you decide to study
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.120]   applied mathematics in the first place?
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.320]   - Oh, let's see.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.880]   So, you know, I've been really interested in the internet
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.280]   ever since I was a teenager.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.680]   This was sort of the height of the dot-com boom,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.520]   you know, 1909, 2000s, and I had a couple friends and I
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.880]   that were just interested in learning how to program
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.440]   for the web and build websites that were, you know,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.600]   gonna be fun and enjoyable that we thought
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.480]   my friends and I would find useful.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.040]   And so I've been tinkering around building websites
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.000]   with the internet, you know, from a teenager,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.280]   and so I think I'd always had it in my mind
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.320]   that that was something I wanted to do full-time
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.040]   once I graduated college and, you know,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.600]   was gonna be working.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.480]   And it was just, you know, magical
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.880]   when I was doing this in high school
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.160]   how much of an impact one could have
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.200]   with the internet's existence.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.440]   You know, we made some websites that reached people
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.760]   all around the country, you know,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.480]   millions of users on these sites.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.560]   At one point, we owned three of the top 10
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.160]   most visited sites by teenagers on the internet.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.400]   - In high school?
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.680]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.960]   This was in 2002, 2003.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.960]   And it was just surreal how, you know,
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.280]   a 13, 14, 15-year-old living with his parents
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.520]   could reach so many people because of the internet.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.720]   And, you know, when you're in school,
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.360]   you kind of tend to think of your community
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.320]   as just who you know in school,
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.960]   and your life's borders don't really extend
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.600]   beyond the school walls.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.040]   But with the internet, that's totally different.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.480]   You can reach people all across the country,
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.360]   all around the world, have a bigger impact
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.880]   and reach more people than, you know,
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.280]   you could have ever imagined.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.320]   And so I was always obsessed with that,
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.080]   having had that experience in high school.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.320]   And that's what led me down the path of entrepreneurship
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.320]   when I graduated from Harvard.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.160]   - Got it.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.400]   So do you, I mean, I guess that's pretty unique
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.320]   for a high schooler to create websites
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.280]   that actually attracts a lot of people, you know,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.640]   not just, you know, 50 people,
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.160]   your friends and your parents.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.840]   So do you feel that that was a big weighting
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.480]   for how you got into Harvard?
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.480]   Because now, you know, we talk about,
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.640]   you know, we have kids now,
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.840]   and we're thinking about secondary education
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.000]   and college education,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.640]   and you saw that affirmative action ruling.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.640]   How, what were the components for you to get into Harvard?
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.600]   Like grades, like how did that work?
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.480]   - Yeah, you know, it's tough to say.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.360]   I don't know how much of the internet experience
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.720]   ended up helping me.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.600]   I was probably naive about it,
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.080]   and I don't even know if I ended up writing about it
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.400]   or putting it on my essays.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.080]   I probably should have.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.000]   You know, to me, you know, the website stuff
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.040]   that I was doing in high school was just for fun,
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.400]   and, you know, I didn't do it kind of, you know,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.200]   thinking that it was gonna help me get into college,
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.560]   and I don't even think I realized
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.480]   it could have potentially helped me get into college.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.160]   So maybe it helped, maybe it didn't.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.320]   It's tough to say.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.920]   In hindsight, I probably should have emphasized it
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920]   more in my essays.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.160]   You know, I was a good student, you know, so good grades.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.000]   - Everybody's a good student.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.560]   - Good SAT score, so no doubt,
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.180]   the kind of academics helped me get into college.
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.340]   You know, it's obviously harder now than it was
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.740]   when I applied to enter a college in 2004,
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.780]   so who knows if I'd get in today,
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.420]   but was certainly lucky to have a good outcome back then.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.900]   - Okay, so it wasn't like you cured malaria
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.860]   or, you know, you invented something at 16
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.020]   that wasn't in the Science Magazine or something?
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.180]   - I did not do any of those things.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.980]   - Okay, 'cause I'm always wondering, I'm like,
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.700]   what is, I mean, 'cause if you look at the percentage
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.620]   acceptance rates, it's like 5%.
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.100]   You know, back then it was like maybe 8%.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.300]   It's still really low, and it feels like
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.900]   it's almost like winning the lottery
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.780]   because everybody has those high academic standards.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.100]   - Yeah, that's right, and also, you know,
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.380]   I went to a public school growing up
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.340]   and was also kind of naive in sort of now realizing,
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.140]   oh, you know, it seems like there's maybe an advantage
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.380]   potentially if you go to private school
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.540]   or certain private schools, and there's all these things
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.760]   that I hear about, you know, kids doing these days
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.900]   to join this activity or do this extracurricular
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.300]   or play this sport and essentially kind of, you know,
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.620]   maximize their chances to get into college
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.140]   based on what they think is gonna help,
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.140]   and I feel so lucky that I didn't know any of that
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.980]   growing up, 'cause I feel like it would have really been
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.260]   a lot of pressure to, you know, think about
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.400]   all of these optimizations that I was gonna have to do
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.860]   to get into a good college, and, you know,
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.140]   it worked out in the end, and so,
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.260]   that was, you know, really fortunate,
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.740]   and I'm glad that it worked out without having to,
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.860]   you know, go through what it seems like a lot of
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.300]   kids are going through these days in terms of feeling like
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.860]   they have to check off these 10 boxes to, you know,
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.060]   have a chance at going to a good college.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.720]   I can't imagine growing up in that environment today.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.680]   - Right, right.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.140]   So, okay, so after college, you got your degree
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.380]   in applied mathematics, what did you do?
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.320]   What was your goal?
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.720]   And what did you do?
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.760]   - So, you asked before why I picked applied math
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.340]   and, as my major, and the reason I chose that
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.440]   was because I looked at the course catalog
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.820]   and found the classes that I was most interested in taking,
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.420]   and chose the major that would allow me to get credit
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.440]   for the most number of those classes.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.200]   So, it turned out I was interested in taking
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.920]   some math classes, some economics classes,
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.960]   some computer science classes, and applied math
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.400]   ended up letting me count all those classes as credits.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.040]   And so that's why I picked it.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.360]   And, you know, to be honest, I was a good student in college
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   but I didn't spend a ton of time in class or studying.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.080]   I really enjoyed the social experience of kind of
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.480]   being in college, especially with, you know,
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.160]   students of a really high caliber at Harvard.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.760]   And so I don't know if I had any kind of goal in mind
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.680]   when I graduated.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.320]   You know, I kind of applied to sort of the standard jobs
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   that other applied math majors did,
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.000]   which, you know, in 2008 when I graduated,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.480]   tended to be kind of finance and management consulting.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.000]   So, you know, I interned at J.P. Morgan
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.280]   my sophomore summer.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.200]   I, you know, applied and got accepted to join McKinsey
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.280]   full-time in New York City after college.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.280]   But I ended up not going into either of those fields
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.920]   and decided to start a startup instead
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.480]   and try to, you know, do that in a quote unquote real way.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.840]   You know, the stuff I did in high school,
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.980]   it ended up being a business,
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.160]   but we didn't have any employees,
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.140]   we didn't have any funding,
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.380]   there was no business school behind the websites.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.040]   It was just for fun.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.760]   But when I graduated college, I thought, you know,
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.200]   I enjoyed creating those websites so much
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.640]   that if I could do that full-time and support myself,
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.720]   you know, there's no better job that I could imagine
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.680]   than one that I enjoyed so much already.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.560]   And so I really wanted to see
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.840]   if I could make that work as a career.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.480]   And so I started my, you know,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.760]   first quote unquote startup out of college.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.180]   - Well, that's interesting because I think a lot of people,
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.460]   the stat is about 58% of Harvard graduates
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.420]   go into tech, management consulting, and finance.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.340]   And that's really different from, you know,
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.360]   the people when they were in high school,
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.460]   when they were applying and they're saying
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.560]   they want to save the world
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.800]   and do non-profits and all that.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.280]   And I think there's a strong financial component,
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.560]   a return on education component.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.740]   So given you went to Harvard,
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.480]   was it necessary to go to college to start your startup?
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.360]   Because you didn't end up going into that route
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.520]   that, you know, would secure you a six-figure
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.960]   and eventually maybe a seven-figure income.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.080]   - No, that's right.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.780]   I mean, when I started that startup out of college,
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.200]   I think I paid myself 20K or 30K.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.300]   So it was by no means a lucrative job.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.160]   And certainly if I went into management consulting
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.360]   or finance, my salary would have been much higher than that.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.840]   And so you're right that I, you know,
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.960]   maybe didn't need to go to Harvard
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.600]   in order to start a company.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.680]   Anybody can do that.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.440]   You don't need permission to do it.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.360]   You know, I still feel like my college experience
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.920]   was so positive, maybe from a non-financial perspective.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.380]   You know, the friends I made, you know,
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:12.400]   how I grew as a person, the experiences and activities
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.200]   that I was a part of.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.720]   I look back at that time and it was just sort of
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.320]   this magical four years.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.720]   And I don't know if it's possible
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.160]   to kind of put a price tag on it.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.360]   So you might be right that, you know,
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.480]   financially speaking, unless you're, you know,
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.360]   you're looking to go into one of those high-paying jobs
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.720]   after college, it might not be worth
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   going to a high-priced university.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.920]   For me, I look at more at the intangibles
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.440]   of attending college like Harvard
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.500]   as it being worthwhile, even if it's unclear
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.460]   whether the financial returns were there.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.360]   - Got it.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.220]   But you did go through the interview process
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.220]   with finance and management consulting,
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.980]   and you got the offers, and obviously
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.940]   the salaries are pretty decent.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.660]   They're definitely decent now.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.580]   So how did you decide, okay, you got the offer
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.500]   and you said, nope, I'm not gonna do this.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.260]   Why not take the job, it's like a sure thing,
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.900]   build your finances, and then work
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.620]   on your startup on the side?
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.700]   - Yeah, I think that would have been
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.480]   a totally viable route, and certainly
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.440]   I have classmates who did just that
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.840]   and ended up starting a company later
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.640]   when they felt more secure.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.640]   I think for me, I just really knew
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.280]   I loved to create websites and build technology,
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.840]   and I had that experience from a young age.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.200]   And so if I knew that was my passion
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.160]   and that was my calling and that was
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.020]   what I enjoyed doing and I liked,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.620]   why do something else for a few years
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.260]   and defer what I knew was ultimately
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.860]   gonna be the path I wanted to pursue?
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.340]   Why not just start now?
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.620]   And in fact, the younger you are,
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.580]   you have less responsibilities,
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.660]   no family, no kids, no dependents.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.580]   You can live on 25K a year.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.100]   And I think I maybe feared, and maybe irrationally so,
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.860]   that if I took one of those high-paying jobs,
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.160]   I would get sucked in and never end up
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.360]   leaving to pursue my own path,
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.240]   and I would've looked back on my life and my career
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.240]   and felt maybe some regret that I didn't take the leap.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.400]   Again, who knows if that's how it would've worked out.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.560]   I think it was a little bit more of
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.120]   just an irrational fear in my head,
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.120]   but it was a factor in my decision
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.720]   to forego the more stable jobs
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.520]   and instead just pursue my startup from the get-go.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.320]   So I could never experience the, maybe,
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.480]   quote-unquote comforts of having a safe job.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.760]   And in fact, to this day, I've still never had a stable job.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.720]   And so maybe that has helped me get more comfortable
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.120]   with the uncertainty that comes
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.800]   with going the startup route.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.760]   - Right.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.280]   I do think it's unique, though,
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.320]   to be able to decide with confidence
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   what you wanna do by age 22, 23, and then just go for it.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.880]   I mean, what kind of, did you have any kind of safety net
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.760]   if you failed?
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.600]   What was the safety net you thought about?
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.560]   - Yeah, it's a good point.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.880]   And confidence is one way to put it.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.080]   That's a generous way to put it.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.920]   I think at that age,
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.840]   maybe hubris was maybe more like it when I was 22,
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.980]   maybe a bit naive in that regard.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.160]   I did have, to be candid, did have some safety net
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.440]   because of the websites in high school
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.540]   that I made with my friend.
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:25.520]   We did end up monetizing those and attracting advertisers
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.840]   because we had amassed such a large audience.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.360]   And so did end up making money from those websites
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.840]   over the years that we were in high school and college,
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.320]   even sold one of those websites.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.620]   So did have a financial safety net
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.920]   in a way that other college graduates didn't.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.200]   And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.640]   that that did play a role in being comfortable,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.040]   taking the plunge.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.880]   - Got it.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.200]   So you started early, had some recurring revenue.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.880]   Of course you have your parents.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.240]   And you live cheaply, 20, 25 grand, no problem, right?
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.840]   Worst case, you can kind of move back in
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.320]   with your parents, I guess.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.720]   - Yeah, and just, I live in San Francisco now,
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.520]   but back then I lived in New Haven, Connecticut
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.260]   because I started that startup out of college
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.920]   with some Yale friends.
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.040]   And so cost of living was pretty low.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.160]   - Okay.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.520]   And so after college, you started your startup.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.280]   When did Y Combinator start?
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.240]   And was that the start of Captain 401k,
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.760]   which is now Human Interest?
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.720]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.760]   So a few years into my first startup,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.680]   which is called Thunder,
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.680]   I got the idea for what is now Human Interest,
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.400]   which is a digital 401k provider
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.120]   for small and medium-sized businesses.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.080]   And that idea came out of my own experience
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.560]   trying to set up a 401k for Thunder.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.080]   Where we were hiring,
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.320]   this is the first startup out of college,
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.340]   we were hiring experienced engineers
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.200]   out of big companies like Microsoft,
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.120]   and 401k was one of their top requests.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.200]   And we thought, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.320]   It's already hard enough for a no-name startup
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.000]   to hire great engineers
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.760]   and attract them for bigger companies
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.360]   because the pay is a lot lower from a salary perspective.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.560]   It's gonna hurt us even more
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   if we don't even have basic benefits like a 401k.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.560]   And so I thought, okay, we should certainly set one up.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.080]   And I'm like you,
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.080]   I'm also a strong believer in personal finance,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.800]   and so I just thought it was the right thing to do.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.480]   And so I go online and assume,
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.760]   okay, I can just look up online 401k,
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.720]   click a few buttons,
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.240]   and voila, we'd have a 401k for our small business.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.980]   And it turned out to be nowhere near as easy as that
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.480]   to get a 401k.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:55.880]   I soon found myself in this whole world of brokers
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:01.120]   and humans and paperwork
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.380]   and complex financial jargon about 401ks.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.680]   And companies like Fidelity wouldn't even talk to us
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.020]   because we were too small for them.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.120]   And everybody else like John Hancock and so on
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.860]   required a bunch of calls and meetings and paperwork
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.840]   and wading through lots of financial jargon
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.480]   to make all these decisions.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.180]   And it was just really painful
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.680]   even to get a 401k off the ground,
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.160]   let alone all the ongoing administrative
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.960]   and compliance work that I learned
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.860]   we were gonna have to do even once we set up a 401k.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.920]   And so despite 401k being the top employee request
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.600]   that we got at the time,
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.380]   we never got one.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.820]   For years, we did not get a 401k,
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.260]   we didn't have an HR team or finance team
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.060]   to do all the administration.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.400]   And me and my co-founders,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.460]   we were too busy trying to get the company off the ground
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.040]   to spend time on 401k setup.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.600]   And that always made me feel kind of embarrassed
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.520]   that we were trying to be this legitimate business
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.360]   and we couldn't offer such a common,
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.920]   important benefit to our employees.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.680]   And then it turned out that,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.240]   I realized later that we were not alone.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.040]   In fact, even though we think of 401ks as very common,
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.620]   and it is common across large businesses,
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.640]   for companies under 100 employees,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.120]   only something like only 20% of those businesses
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.480]   have a 401k.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.560]   And meaning 80% of small businesses don't have a 401k.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.640]   And that stat was shocking to me when I learned it
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.500]   because how could it be that this is the way
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.400]   that Americans are supposed to save for retirement,
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.280]   yet you have tens of millions of people
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.400]   who don't even have access to a 401k
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.480]   because they work for a small business
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.920]   that doesn't offer one.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.760]   - Got it.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.260]   I mean, that's a great problem to solve.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.000]   - Yeah, and it also, as a technologist,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.080]   it also frustrated me that it didn't feel like
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.840]   these barriers need to exist.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.880]   Since 2015, there's no reason it felt that
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.080]   I needed to wade through all this paperwork
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.400]   to set up a 401k.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   There seemed to be no reason why I had to talk
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.560]   and have meetings and calls with these brokers
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.240]   to get one going.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.580]   Why couldn't I just do it online?
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:22.320]   Everything was possible online at that point in time.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.920]   And so it just seemed to me like
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.820]   if there was a way that we could automate
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.280]   and digitize the 401k experience,
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.680]   then more small businesses like my own
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.440]   would be able to offer that really meaningful benefit
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.880]   to their employees, and we'd be better off
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.220]   and maybe make a small dent in this
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.740]   looming retirement crisis that we face as a country.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.180]   - Sure, sure.
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.220]   Can you explain to the listeners
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.500]   who are the players in the 401k and how they make money,
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.280]   including human interest?
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.280]   - Yes, so there's two ways that 401k providers make money.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.220]   One is that they charge the company fees,
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.900]   monthly fees, annual fees,
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.820]   kind of like a software as a service model.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.860]   - Got it, so Fidelity would charge a big company
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.860]   a certain fee based on what?
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.540]   Assets under management, number of employees?
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.460]   How does it work?
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.780]   - Yeah, usually number of employees,
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.620]   but assets do take into account as well.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.540]   And that's the second way that 401k providers make money
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.740]   is off of the assets.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.380]   And it's this kind of shady thing
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.700]   where they will put investment options,
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.700]   mutual funds in the 401ks that they get kickbacks from.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.340]   - Like high fee actively run funds with high expense.
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.820]   - High fee actively managed mutual funds
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:47.820]   that often kick back revenue share to the 401k provider
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.940]   or the broker or the advisor.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.780]   And so that's another revenue stream.
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:57.220]   And that of course, we always thought was really bad
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.860]   because it's a conflict of interest
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.200]   and ends up hurting the employees
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.020]   who are saving their hard earned money in the 401k
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.700]   because they're just getting these fees siphoned off
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.220]   from the assets that the employees put in
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.220]   because of this conflict of interest
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.900]   where there's this kickback revenue share going on.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.340]   - Right, right, right.
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.580]   So if I was Fidelity, would it not be wise for me
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.200]   to offer the 401k plan to all of Microsoft
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.060]   and then load the options
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.580]   only as Fidelity actively run funds?
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.740]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:30.780]   - Double revenue?
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.100]   - Absolutely, yep.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.060]   So Fidelity, and I don't wanna speak
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.020]   for any specific company,
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.420]   but one of these companies might say to Microsoft,
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.540]   okay, we'll charge less to the company
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.460]   because we know we can make more money off of the assets,
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.660]   especially for someone like Microsoft
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.380]   who has lots of assets in their 401k plan.
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.880]   - Right, like huge.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.500]   - Yeah, and then try to make money off of the assets.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.300]   Now, Microsoft's big enough that they're wise enough
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.380]   to try to negotiate the investment funds
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.140]   that they're not gonna put in really high,
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.340]   or I hope they don't put in really high,
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.020]   expensive mutual funds that don't make sense to be there.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.580]   But a small business doesn't know any better.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.820]   And small businesses don't have investment committees
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.460]   the way that Microsoft does.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.340]   And so if you look at the average asset fee
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.380]   for a small business,
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.240]   it's way higher, 1%, 2% on average
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.740]   compared to a large, well-run enterprise like Microsoft,
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.820]   which often is able to get the asset fees
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.540]   to just a fraction of a percent.
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.180]   - I see, so the small business would pay 1% to 2%
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.460]   to the 401k provider every month or year,
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.820]   ongoing forever.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.260]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.980]   Whereas the bigger businesses like Microsoft,
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.420]   they have the bargaining power,
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.140]   they have the know-how and investment committees
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.260]   to be able to negotiate that down.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.100]   - Got it.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.380]   And given we all know that fees are not as good as no fees
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.780]   and actively run money managers tend to underperform
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.500]   over the long term versus index funds,
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.340]   wouldn't it be logical to assume
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.180]   that all companies would say,
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.340]   well, give us some variety of index funds,
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.100]   passively run, low-cost index funds
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.180]   as part of your portfolio of all funds available?
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.020]   - Absolutely.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.740]   And we are seeing, thankfully,
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.580]   some pressure moving in that direction
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:31.300]   where now most 401k plans do at least have index funds
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.620]   in the mix, in the menu lined up.
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.180]   So it's not all actively managed mutual funds
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.340]   the way that it used to be.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.060]   That said, some of these 401k providers
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.740]   are still pretty sneaky about it.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.900]   They'll offer a couple of index funds in there,
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.140]   but they kind of count on the employee
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.900]   to know about them and to choose them.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.340]   And the default option is still not the index fund
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.580]   or the index funds are only one or two out of the 20.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.820]   And so you have to really know
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.220]   to look for the expense ratio
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.140]   to identify the index funds as a participant
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.340]   to be able to take advantage of that.
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.580]   And the 401k provider is betting
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.060]   that the vast majority of employees
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.340]   aren't gonna realize that
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.660]   and will just put their money in higher fee funds.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.500]   - Got it.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.260]   So I guess all listeners listening,
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.220]   it's important to have a good HR person explain to you
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.180]   and it's good to review those funds
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.860]   and x-ray your portfolio for excessive fees
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.900]   and look at their performance.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.380]   I mean, maybe the fees are warranted
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.980]   if they have a huge, awesome, outperforming track record
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.980]   over the past 10 years.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.780]   So human interest is not,
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.180]   you guys don't create mutual funds,
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.900]   you don't offer funds, but you set up 401k plans.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.060]   So how do you bring those funds into,
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.620]   those options into a small business
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.180]   and then how do you guys make money?
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.020]   - Yeah, so our primary revenue stream
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.900]   comes from the monthly fees that the company pays.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.460]   We do make a small percentage of revenue off of the assets,
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.060]   but it's much, much less than what's typical in the industry.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.100]   And the reason for that is because
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.260]   we can bring in any fund that's available.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.700]   So we don't have our own funds,
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.780]   we don't make money off the funds,
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.500]   which means that the vast majority of the funds
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.540]   that our customers choose are index funds
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.420]   from places like Vanguard.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.060]   And so there are lower fee index funds
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.260]   coming from Vanguard and others.
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.620]   We let the company choose,
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.500]   so if they wanted to use Fidelity funds, they can,
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.500]   if they wanna use BlackRock funds, they can.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.780]   So we have access to pretty much every fund that's out there
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.940]   and we buy us and encourage our customers use index funds
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.220]   because that's going to be the better approach
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.740]   for their employees in terms of lower fees.
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.460]   - Okay, so do those fund creators,
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.500]   do they try to pitch you guys and say,
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.860]   "Hey, can you include our funds
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.220]   "in the plans that you set up?"
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.860]   Or no, how does that work?
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.180]   - Yeah, initially no, because we were so small
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.420]   that nobody really cared.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.020]   That might be changing as we grow,
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.620]   as we get more assets, maybe funds do care.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.160]   And I remember in the early days,
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.420]   we did have a couple of companies pitch us,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.420]   but we always said no because
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:11.060]   they were trying to get their high fee funds in there
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.760]   and we didn't think that made sense for our customers.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.260]   - Okay, so things are changing a little bit now.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.500]   And so when you package, is it a package where you say,
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.100]   "Here is a 401k product that we set up,
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.080]   "we do the administration and everything,
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.660]   "and here's the portfolio funds you can choose."
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:33.580]   And where does the fund actually, I guess, sit?
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.420]   - Ah, yes.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.700]   We don't actually custody the assets ourselves,
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.220]   so we do the software part in terms of
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.540]   automating the setup,
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.980]   automating the administration and compliance,
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.780]   integrating with the company's payroll system,
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.660]   having an account for employees
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.820]   and administrators to access.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.900]   But it's not our funds and we don't hold the money.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.560]   The funds are held through a third party custodian,
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.560]   kind of like a brokerage house or a third party custodian.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.980]   - Got it.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:05.920]   So if I was a small business,
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.260]   one of the 80% of small businesses with no 401k,
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.520]   how do I, do I just go to humaninterest.com
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.840]   and fill out the contact form?
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.680]   - Yep, exactly.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.560]   Yeah, you can go to humaninterest.com
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.000]   and then click get started.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.620]   And you should be able to get up and running pretty quickly.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.720]   - Got it.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.360]   And so just shifting gears a little bit,
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.400]   so let's say I was working at Human Interest.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.800]   What would be, right now,
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.820]   the most important job at Human Interest?
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.240]   Is it business development to get more businesses?
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.200]   What is that job that would be the most lucrative job
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.840]   and beneficial job to the company of Human Interest?
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.760]   - That's a great question.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.040]   You know, I think there's two, you know,
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.320]   kind of core areas of priority that I can think of
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.800]   that we're, you know, working hard on
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.720]   and the team is working hard on.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.520]   One is, of course, getting more customers.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.520]   So we now have, I think something's like 15,000
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.300]   small business customers on Human Interest,
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.540]   which has, you know, grown a lot over the years,
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.020]   but is still a tiny, tiny sliver
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.060]   of the millions of small businesses
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.660]   that could and should have a 401k.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.660]   And so certainly any efforts to get the word out
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.100]   to make it more known that, you know,
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.180]   small businesses now have a better way to get a 401k
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.860]   and it's not possible for them to get a 401k,
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.920]   that's certainly very important to us.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.540]   And then we're also making a ton of investments
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.000]   to improve the technology experience.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.080]   The whole model behind Human Interest is that
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.760]   by automating every part of the 401k stack,
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.040]   we can lower the cost for the business,
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.560]   lower the time it takes for a business to run a 401k
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.200]   and get more employees to save for retirement.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.680]   But there's a reason why it hadn't been done before.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.120]   It's because it's really, really hard.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.440]   There's a lot of different aspects of a 401k
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.760]   and to automate every single one
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.280]   is a pretty big undertaking.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.200]   And, you know, we made a lot of progress on that
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.580]   and there's even more we can do.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.640]   And the more we can do of that,
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.720]   the better experience it's gonna be for customers
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.200]   and for their employees and the more small businesses
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.340]   that will be able to offer a 401k.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.800]   So those are the two, you know,
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.720]   two of the main things that the company's working on.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.160]   There's definitely other initiatives and projects
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.240]   that are important as well,
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.340]   but those are the two that come to mind for me.
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:34.200]   - Right.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.640]   How important is regulation of the 401k?
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.080]   And do you foresee any regulatory changes
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.920]   in the retirement plan of America?
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.580]   Because I think most of us would prefer pensions for life,
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:53.720]   but we have our 401k and it's like 22,500 max to contribute.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.640]   And I don't know if that's enough for most people.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:01.280]   - Yeah, regulations do play a key role with 401ks.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.400]   You know, they govern everything
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.000]   from how much an employee is allowed to contribute
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.680]   and get tax advantages of.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.900]   They govern, you know, things like
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.640]   what investments can be made available
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.260]   and who's responsible for those.
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:20.760]   Even now, there's certain locations and states
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.520]   that are making a retirement plan mandatory
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.280]   for small businesses to offer.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.120]   And so some of the--
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.640]   - That's good for you guys.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.280]   And many of the recent regulations
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.880]   have been very favorable to human interest
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.240]   because they promote small businesses
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.600]   to get a retirement plan.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.920]   So for example, there are now these state mandates,
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.040]   for example, in California,
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.720]   companies are now required to offer a retirement plan
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.000]   to their employees and the same is true
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.360]   in other areas as well.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.720]   And then there's been federal legislation
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.320]   that passed recently, the Secure Act 2.0,
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.760]   that also provides financial incentives
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.640]   for small businesses to offer a 401k.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.320]   And so essentially, via tax credits,
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.400]   the small business can offset a huge portion,
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.240]   if not all of the cost of getting a 401k.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.040]   And so the government, you know,
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   is aware that we have a looming retirement crisis.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.960]   They're aware that a big challenge
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:21.080]   is getting small businesses to offer a 401k plan.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   And so via these state mandates or financial incentives,
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.560]   they are trying to encourage,
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.040]   and in some cases require,
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.520]   more small businesses to offer a 401k,
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.440]   which we hope, you know,
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.560]   combined with technology like ours
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.120]   that makes it easy for them to do so,
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.120]   will make it possible for more small businesses
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.520]   to offer a 401k.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.680]   - It sounds structurally you guys are in the right direction.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.680]   It's kind of like 68% of Americans own homes
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.960]   and the government wants more home ownership
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.360]   with through the tax incentives,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.200]   the tax-free profit gains of 250,000 to 500,000.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.120]   So it sounds like you're in the right spot long-term.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:07.120]   So when you created your pitch deck for YC,
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.720]   was that part of the main pitch?
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.560]   How did, 'cause I know like YC doesn't accept anybody,
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.480]   it's just like really small percentage as well.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.840]   So how did you come up with pitch deck
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.160]   and how many founders did you have?
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.080]   How did you go about that scenario?
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.080]   - Yeah, I had one co-founder, Paul, who was our CTO.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:29.080]   And the main pitch to YC was what I had said earlier.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:34.680]   The thesis of the company was that 80% of small businesses
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.680]   don't offer 401k and as a result,
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.280]   tens of millions of Americans
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.840]   don't have access to a retirement plan.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.520]   And that both of those numbers could be improved
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.560]   if we digitize and automated a 401k
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.800]   and Human Interest was gonna be the company to do that.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.640]   - Right, and then obviously they saw your background
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.440]   and experience, education and experience
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.600]   building websites before.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.600]   How did you find your co-founder?
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.760]   - Oh, I met him through a mutual friend.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.440]   So we hadn't really worked together
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.680]   or known each other before,
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.600]   but we were both kind of in a place
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.680]   where we were both looking to start our next company.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.520]   - Okay.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.520]   - And Paul, I am very interested
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.400]   and passionate about personal finance.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.760]   Paul was not, but had encountered the 401k problem
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.320]   firsthand as an employee at Mozilla,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.360]   where we looked at his 401k account
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.000]   and it turned out that all of his 401k savings
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.520]   through his Mozilla 401k were just in cash.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.360]   And it turned out he was not invested at all
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.360]   despite being a young person
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.880]   and because cash was the default option
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.120]   in Mozilla's 401k plan.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.680]   And as your listeners probably know,
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.000]   he should be taking a lot more risk
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.640]   for his retirement plan, especially given his age.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.760]   So we realized that there was actually
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.720]   sort of a twofold problem in 401k.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.200]   One was my own experience as a business owner
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.240]   failing to be able to set up a 401k
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.080]   because it was too complicated.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.200]   And the second challenge was Paul as an employee
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.280]   who did have access to a 401k,
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.640]   but was still making some optimal decisions in it.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.240]   And we thought that there would be opportunity
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.360]   for software to help with both of those problems.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.200]   - Got it.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.760]   So if he was the CTO, you know,
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.880]   building the technology, what were you doing?
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.640]   - Yeah, I was the CEO and in charge of the business side,
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.200]   I guess, you know, trying to get customers,
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.320]   trying to get funding.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.320]   And kind of playing the role of a product manager
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.640]   and helping, you know, figure out what we should build,
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.760]   especially given my knowledge of a 401k
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.480]   is dating from my previous experience.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.320]   - Got it.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.760]   And when you applied to YC,
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.440]   what were the conditions of the investment?
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.440]   How much did you get and what equity stake did they take?
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.480]   - Oh, that's a good question.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.920]   I can't remember the specifics.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.240]   I know it's evolved a bit over the years,
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.720]   but I wanna say, you know, we gave up 7% of the company
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.880]   or something around that maybe it was six or eight.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.440]   I can't remember the exact number.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.080]   And I think the investment amount
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.360]   was somewhere around 100k or 200k.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.200]   - Yeah.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.720]   - But again, can't remember the exact specifics.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.560]   - Got it.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.320]   - I know they've changed the terms, you know,
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.200]   over the years.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.680]   This was in 2015.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.520]   - Right.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.160]   And so 7% and 150k,
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.880]   obviously now that your company is a success,
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.880]   when you look at that number,
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.320]   100k or 150k that you gave up,
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.200]   do you find it was worth it?
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.680]   - Yeah, I thought YC was worth it.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.400]   Not for the investment dollars per se.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.960]   You know, I think if you look at that particular deal,
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.400]   it's pretty clear that that's very favorable for YC
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.120]   from a, you know, just dollars invested
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.040]   versus ownership obtained perspective.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.280]   And so most of the value in YC is not the actual dollars,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.920]   but just sort of the experience that you get
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.400]   from going through YC.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.720]   Everything from the mentorship and advice that you get,
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:17.400]   the access to the other YC companies and alumni companies
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.800]   that could be your first few customers,
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.320]   the access to investors that you get
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.400]   at the end of the program during demo day.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.440]   There's obviously some brand value,
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.560]   which helps with early recruiting,
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.320]   trying to attract your initial few hires
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.920]   that may, you know, be skeptical otherwise.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.280]   Among other reasons, I think those are the reasons
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.000]   why companies should do YC,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.480]   not for the actual investment amount.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.520]   - Although the investment amount, if you have zero dollars,
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.640]   I mean, that's-- - It doesn't hurt, for sure.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.560]   It helps you get through the first few months
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.920]   of, you know, when it's just the founding team.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.320]   - Right, right.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.720]   Now, so you guys have two founders,
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:58.240]   and then so one of the big challenges is to find people,
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.560]   right, to convince people to join you,
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.200]   but also to take a lot of risks,
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.440]   because as you said, joining startups,
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.480]   your pay is much lower than a standard established
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.720]   company pay for the hopes that your equity
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.400]   will turn into something great.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.080]   But I know that it seems kind of risky, right?
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.320]   Like your first 10 employees,
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.920]   you're taking a huge amount of risk
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.280]   at the angel round or series A round,
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.840]   and then the equity percentage is like a percent,
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.360]   maybe 2%.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.000]   Like how would you recommend employees
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.920]   who wanna join startups think about that calculation?
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.400]   - I think there's the financial aspect,
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.600]   and then the non-financial aspect.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.120]   With the financial aspect, the deal is,
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.320]   yeah, your salary is lower, it's a less stable job,
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.120]   and hopefully the equity becomes worth a lot,
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.000]   and so it's sort of a high risk, high reward situation.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.440]   But I always caution our employees and our hires,
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.840]   I can't promise you that the equity would be worth anything.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.400]   It could work out great and be very financially rewarding,
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.240]   and certainly there's been many cases of companies
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.920]   where that's happened to the early employees,
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.200]   and we hope the same is true for human interest employees.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.600]   But at the same time, it is very risky,
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.960]   and I never wanna mislead folks into thinking
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.000]   that it's gonna be sort of a sure jackpot, right?
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.360]   But I think that there are very significant,
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.720]   for the right person, non-financial benefits
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.360]   to joining a startup.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.000]   The level of ownership that they get,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.680]   the ability to make an impact,
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.480]   the experience they get,
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.240]   being able to wear different hats
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.320]   and get exposure throughout the business,
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.400]   and of course, for folks that are aspiring
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.120]   to become founders in the future,
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.520]   that front row seat to the early stages of a growing startup
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.160]   that can help shape their future entrepreneurial endeavor.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.840]   And so I feel like, and for some people,
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.080]   it's just more fun to be part of an early stage startup,
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.400]   and they don't like being at a big company.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:04.400]   Yeah, the reason why I decided to go down entrepreneurship
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.120]   is not because I thought it was gonna be
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.800]   necessarily more financially rewarding
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.240]   than taking a big company job,
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.800]   but just because I knew I enjoyed it more,
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.800]   and that's what I was passionate about.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.600]   And so I think for an early employee
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.160]   to make sense at an early stage startup,
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.800]   there has to be some element of that as well.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   It can't be a pure sort of dollars and cents calculation.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.400]   Oftentimes, the ones who get the most out of it
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.680]   end up getting value because it helps them
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.880]   with their career path down the road
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.240]   because of the experience that they got
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.680]   when at an early stage startup.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.080]   - Right, right, right.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.560]   You know, I think a lot about opportunity
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.920]   at financialsamurai.com,
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.920]   and I feel like not everybody has the same opportunity.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.440]   I feel that one of the ways to increase your opportunity
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.840]   is to live in a city where there are more opportunities.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.800]   So if you wanna do AI, maybe you come to San Francisco.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.960]   If you wanna do banking, you go to New York City.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.980]   If you wanna do media, you go to Los Angeles.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.320]   But I remember when I was in finance,
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.600]   and I was thinking in 2012,
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.720]   I was like, I wanna do this startup thing, this tech thing.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.880]   But I applied everywhere, and I couldn't get a job anywhere.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.800]   Like I saw Airbnb valued at 2.8 billion,
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.880]   and I was like, this is a no-brainer.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.720]   I wanna join.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.440]   I couldn't get a job there.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.640]   I saw Uber.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.760]   I was like, this is a no-brainer.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.680]   It wasn't as early stage, but I couldn't get in.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.600]   So how do people get in?
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.920]   Like what is one of the paths to get in?
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.600]   Because applying to YC is hard,
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.840]   getting into Harvard's hard.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.280]   What about the rest of us?
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.880]   - Yeah, I think one is to go for a company
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.560]   that is not gonna be as competitive on talent, right?
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.920]   You probably weren't the only one
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.680]   looking to join Airbnb at the time.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.120]   They were a hot company, and a very interesting place
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.620]   to work, and so had probably no shortage of options.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.040]   But if you apply to Human Interest back then,
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.280]   or any of the other sort of companies
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:05.280]   that are kind of no-name at the time startups,
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.640]   I'm sure that the reception could have been
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.040]   a little bit different, because they don't have access
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.340]   to the best people, the top talent,
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.240]   the way that the Airbnbs do.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.560]   So I think kind of taking a flyer
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.840]   on a less competitive startup is certainly one way.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.260]   And then looking for companies that have a unique match
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.980]   to your skill set and experience.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.340]   So if you have a finance background,
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.620]   then maybe looking at a financial technology company,
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.060]   a FinTech startup might make more sense
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.460]   than an Airbnb, for example,
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.020]   just because maybe there's certain skills
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.580]   that you developed when you were in finance
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.900]   that a finance company, a FinTech company,
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.900]   will find valuable in a way that Airbnb might not.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.800]   So those are kind of the two things I could think of.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.680]   Obviously, it's not easy, though.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.260]   And there's no shortage of people looking to get into tech,
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.920]   especially during the boom times.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.200]   That might have changed in more recent years,
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.880]   so maybe this is a better time to look for a tech job,
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.520]   in the sense that not as many people
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.960]   are looking to get into tech,
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.000]   although also there's fewer jobs in tech
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.040]   given the current downturn.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.160]   So TBD on that.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:24.180]   - Let's, 'cause we met maybe in 2015 or 2016,
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:27.100]   and so yeah, you had a company, Captain 401K,
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.860]   you're probably looking for exposure.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.380]   I had Financial Samurai, it's been around since 2009.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:33.220]   But yeah, so for me, I was like,
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:37.080]   I never thought, oh, I'm gonna join your company back then.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.300]   But I said, I guess in retrospect,
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.820]   if I said, you know what, that's a great idea,
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.100]   I wish you had pitched me the story
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.620]   in terms of that clarity, I'd be like,
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.420]   oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.060]   I would like to join you as, I don't know,
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.380]   lead business development guy.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.300]   So let's say I got 1% equity, right?
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.660]   It sounds kind of standard.
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:59.780]   And I had my, I don't know, 125, $150,000 salary.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:04.140]   And now it's worth a billion, let's say.
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.980]   So it was worth nothing, now it's worth a billion.
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.140]   So 1% of a billion is 10 million.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.660]   But over those years, let's say eight years,
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:15.140]   how much dilution would I have experienced?
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.520]   Maybe it doesn't have to be specifically your company,
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.080]   just on average, where what would I actually have
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.460]   with a billion dollar valuation eight years later
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.300]   at 1% eight years ago?
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.340]   - Yeah, it's tough to say.
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.780]   I mean, I think dilution is important to consider
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.420]   that the 1% is not gonna stay 1% over time
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.780]   because companies do need to raise funding to keep going
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.580]   and they can either grow and expand.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:40.100]   You know, there are kind of dilution calculators
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.200]   or estimators that you can kind of search out there
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.380]   to get a rough sense.
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.220]   You know, I think sort of standard rule of thumb
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.980]   is that companies will give up somewhere around 20%
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.060]   in their earlier rounds and that kind of goes down
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.460]   over time.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.420]   So you can kind of make some assumptions about,
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.740]   you know, how many rounds they're gonna raise
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.980]   over what period of time to get to, you know,
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.100]   a certain sort of exit outcome.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.180]   It's gonna vary a lot from business to business,
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.440]   from industry to industry, and of course,
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.340]   from year to year, just given kind of fundraising
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.660]   environments and so on.
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.940]   So, you know, unfortunately, just tough to really
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.780]   ballpark estimate just because it can vary so much,
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.540]   but if you wanna get some idea, you know,
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.580]   companies will typically give up around 20%
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.540]   in their earlier rounds.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.740]   You know, that can go down to 10% or lower
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.860]   in later rounds.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.540]   And you can kind of use that to get a sense.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:36.540]   - So maybe my 1% in 2015 would turn into 0.5%?
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:40.180]   - I haven't done the math on it, so.
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.380]   - Come on, you're an applied mathematician.
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.220]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:47.180]   - But I would say, yeah, 20% dilution, 10%,
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.380]   four rounds, ah, 50%.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.220]   You get 50%.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.220]   - Sure, yeah, again, it'll vary a lot
[00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.620]   from business to business, but yeah,
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.180]   you can make different assumptions and kind of see
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.140]   what it turns out to in different scenarios.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:01.340]   - So I wanna rewind time again, back to 2015,
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.700]   we're at a meetup.
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.540]   I was like, Roger, this is such a great idea.
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.940]   You know, I have this platform, I have my background
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.980]   in finance for 13 years.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.560]   Could I have joined human interest then?
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.880]   - Ah, I don't know, I can't remember.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.720]   - Well, 2015, 2016.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.040]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm sure I would've loved to have you.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.000]   You know, at that point, you know,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.800]   we were probably only a handful of employees,
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:30.000]   so, and obviously, you know, had a great background
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.480]   and knew a lot about personal finance,
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.000]   so I'm sure we would've found you valuable
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.440]   in some capacities, so yeah.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.440]   - Well, I say this because I think it's fun
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.520]   to look at things in retrospect,
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.880]   because there's a lot of opportunity
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.920]   that's just staring you in the face
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.480]   that people just don't think to seize
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.320]   or connect the dots or anything,
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.740]   and so I think people need to really slow down,
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.480]   kind of maybe take analysis of who they met,
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.840]   what are they doing, what you really wanna do,
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.280]   and be a little bit more intentional
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.260]   instead of just going on autopilot,
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.280]   doing the same thing over and over again
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.760]   for the next 20, 30 years,
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.720]   'cause I think that's what happens.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.960]   There's this inertia that happens where people say,
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.040]   I'm just gonna do, I'm gonna write three posts a week
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.640]   for 10 years, and you have blinders on.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.320]   - Yeah, that's true, although it sounds like
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.360]   you have a pretty good gig going yourself,
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.320]   so I don't know if it actually would've made sense
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.820]   for you to join even in 2015.
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:24.320]   - Well, yeah, I don't know.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.000]   It's always fun to think what if, right?
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.760]   We can only live one life,
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.840]   but it's always fun to dream and daydream.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.380]   Oh, what if I did this, or all that stuff.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:39.420]   So it sounds like Human Interests is a pretty big success
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.680]   based on where you guys were in 2015.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.320]   I saw a headline, you guys raised a couple hundred million
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.720]   at a billion dollar valuation.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.560]   I don't know when that was.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.800]   It was a couple years ago.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.080]   So who knows now.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.080]   And then you decided your job was done,
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.800]   and you stepped off, CEO, to do it.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.000]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.400]   So as we're hitting growth stage of the business,
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.920]   I brought in a CEO to run the business,
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.020]   and I transitioned to the board of Human Interest.
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.600]   The CEO, Jeff, was someone who had been on our board
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.160]   for a couple years of our company's early life,
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.860]   and who I had actually known socially even before that.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:23.600]   And as a board member, I noticed that he was super helpful
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.480]   in all the growth stage challenges
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:31.320]   that we were about to navigate, or are currently navigating,
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.960]   and thought that he was the perfect person
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.060]   to take Human Interest to the next level.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.940]   I love building, and I love creating.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.780]   At the time, I was feeling pretty burnt out.
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:48.180]   We had our first child, Everett, during that process,
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:53.180]   and I had not yet adjusted my pace of work
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:57.140]   to take into account that we had a newborn.
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.540]   And that took a lot of toll on me.
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:05.540]   And so when I had the opportunity to bring Jeff in as CEO
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:10.700]   to run our business, it just made total sense as a win-win.
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:14.520]   And under his leadership, the company has grown so much
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.580]   over the past few years.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.480]   And I was able to take a full break
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.440]   and went on an external paternity leave
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.000]   when we had our second child, Ellis.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.460]   And this was 2020 into 2021.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:31.180]   And so really fortunate that I got to take a step back
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.800]   personally, be able to spend more time with Ellis,
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.000]   and then it turned out Everett too,
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   because preschools were closed during COVID.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.360]   So thank God I was no longer working full-time.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.280]   And meanwhile, felt like I could trust the company
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:48.200]   in Jeff's hands, and he's done a great job with it since.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.040]   - Right.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.120]   I'm sure some of the listeners thinking,
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:55.360]   oh wow, they raised money at a billion dollar valuation,
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.600]   lots of funding.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.540]   Definitely, it sounds like you guys have a long runway.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.320]   I don't know about when you're gonna be
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.000]   operationally profitable and all that.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.480]   But as only one of two co-founders,
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:09.600]   I think listeners will think, wow, so Roger's set for life.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.840]   Sooner or later, there'll be a massive liquidity event.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.720]   How do you think about that massive liquidity event?
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:19.640]   And do you alter your lifestyle now?
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.840]   Or I mean, it's kind of like a mind boggling
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.920]   amount of potential money windfall that will happen.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:30.440]   - We have tried not to.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:35.520]   I think both my wife and I grew up
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.180]   in a very kind of immigrant frugality mindset.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:44.920]   And we were always taught and raised to save money,
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.440]   to not overspend.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:50.000]   It's the immigrant mindset of frugality,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.680]   and both my wife and I have it.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.960]   And even though I took econ classes that said,
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.120]   hey, you should smooth your consumption,
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.880]   you only get to live once,
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.400]   you don't wanna die with a ton of money.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.880]   We've tried to adapt accordingly,
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:09.560]   but I'd say a lot of our friends will laugh at us
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.480]   for not adapting nearly to the extent
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.240]   that they think we probably should.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.240]   For example, we still drive a 1998 Toyota Camry
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.240]   as our primary car.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:24.440]   And we've just gotten used to just, I think,
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:28.840]   try to live the life that we wanted,
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:33.120]   not get too caught up in buying fancy things and whatever.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.440]   And it's just sort of not what we grew up with,
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.240]   and so it's sort of hard to adapt to that, I guess.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.960]   Obviously, we do spend money where we feel like
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.560]   it's meaningful, so on our children,
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:49.360]   and with childcare, all those things.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.840]   If we feel like, I'm a big proponent, for example,
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.760]   of trading money for time when you have money,
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.440]   but are short on time.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.200]   So often pay for things that give me back time
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.080]   or are more convenient in some way.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:05.480]   But in terms of luxury spending,
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:10.560]   I don't think we'll ever do very much of that.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.080]   - No, yeah, it's hard to change old habits,
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.560]   especially if you've grown up in a frugal household.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.400]   I've had that mindset for a while as well.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.920]   My parents were super frugal,
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.760]   but I'm kind of forcing myself to spend more.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:23.960]   And you start in baby steps,
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.400]   so one of the first steps I started
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.360]   was to spend more on food,
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:30.080]   like really great food from all around the world,
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.560]   'cause it's not gonna crush your budget,
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.960]   but it's something that you can be
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.200]   a little bit more mindful of spending.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.200]   That's interesting.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.480]   It's always interesting to see how,
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:43.320]   if money or a big windfall will change someone.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:46.640]   And it seems like, I think money just amplifies
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.600]   who you already are, what do you think?
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:52.920]   - Yeah, money certainly makes things easier.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.320]   It's certainly better to have more money than less money.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.640]   Again, you can choose what's meaningful
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.080]   for you to spend the money on,
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.680]   and for different people that might mean different things.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:10.160]   But at the same time, I feel like I see these stories
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.680]   of how billionaires spend their money,
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:17.320]   and often think to myself, even if I had that much money,
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.800]   I don't think I'd ever wanna spend money
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.040]   on this kind of stuff.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.840]   I'm not sure it would really give me much value
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.800]   at that point, and maybe better to give it away,
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.400]   or find a better cause for someone
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.960]   who might be able to get more value
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.440]   out of that money than for me,
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.520]   'cause after a certain point,
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.160]   I feel like we've got what we need,
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.760]   and more isn't really gonna make a difference.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:40.000]   - Right.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.080]   So you stepped off your CEO role,
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.040]   and you're still on the board.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.040]   And then what happened?
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.800]   You decided to start another company?
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.240]   - Yeah, so as of 18 months ago,
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:56.760]   I've started now a new business called Comprehensive.io,
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.320]   which is in the field of compensation management.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.360]   So we help companies decide, track,
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.000]   and communicate employee compensation,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.720]   which came from my experience at Human Interest,
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.720]   where it was crazy to me that even though
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.560]   compensation was by far, and is still by far,
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.760]   our biggest expense category,
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.440]   and even though it's a key driver
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:25.240]   of recruiting and retention outcomes for our business,
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:30.680]   it's mind-boggling how compensation
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.800]   is still primarily done via spreadsheets
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.320]   and ad hoc processes, and is not nearly
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.000]   the rigorous discipline that you might think it is,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.400]   given how important it is.
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:45.480]   And as someone who really wanted to use my startups
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:51.560]   to help improve people's financial livelihoods,
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.720]   starting with Human Interest,
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:57.800]   I thought, what better way to make a positive impact
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.640]   on people's financial lives than helping companies
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.800]   make compensation decisions better?
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.480]   And hopefully by doing so,
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.640]   they can make their pay more competitive,
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.840]   they can get closer to pay equity,
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:13.600]   they can make pay more transparent to their employees.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.840]   A lot of these big themes that we started to see
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:20.840]   in the past couple of years that are very meaningful
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:25.520]   from a social perspective, we thought we could accelerate
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:29.160]   if we gave companies the tools and software technology
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.040]   to be able to make those better decisions.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.840]   - And in this round, are you self-funding,
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.720]   or did you raise funds?
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:40.160]   - I self-funded it initially, just to develop the prototype,
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.280]   get our first few early customers,
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.960]   just confirmed to myself that there was a need here
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.800]   and that it was worth me diving back in full-time
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.200]   and committing to.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.560]   I wanted to do that before I brought on outside investors
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:57.040]   or hired employees because I wanted to be sure of myself
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.400]   first, but then once I was sure,
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.520]   then we did raise some outside funding
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.520]   and started hiring employees.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.680]   - How much of starting another company
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.840]   and funding this company, getting outside funding,
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:14.280]   is a desire to prove to yourself that you can do it again?
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.960]   - I wouldn't think of it like that.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.800]   I think for me, for better or worse,
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:23.020]   I've just always been passionate about creating
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:27.760]   and building technology that can make a positive impact
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.080]   on people in some way.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:35.600]   And there's no better way I feel like I can contribute,
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.080]   and so it's very rewarding and fulfilling for me.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:43.800]   And my wife's a doctor, I don't have the skillset
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.840]   or the composure to be able to do that job.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.080]   And so I feel like for me, the best way for me
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:52.760]   to make an impact, given my personality and skillset,
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:56.120]   is by building technology that can improve people's lives
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.120]   in some way.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.360]   And so that's felt like it's been my calling.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.880]   And so as long as I can do that,
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.760]   that's where I feel like I can most meaningfully
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.080]   apply my talents.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:09.920]   - Got it.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.800]   I do feel that there is, I think,
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:15.640]   an underlying core value in you to wanna keep on building,
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:18.660]   because then you started layoffs.fyi,
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:20.160]   which is not a company really,
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.640]   but it's just a tracker on the tech industry layoffs.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.040]   But I think random people who are,
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:30.640]   they've got their day job, they start a company,
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.240]   they're on the board.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.760]   I don't know if random people or the average person
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.360]   just decides to start layoff.fyi, right?
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:41.240]   So I guess, is there this drive to keep on creating?
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.120]   What's going on inside you where you're like,
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.560]   I wanna create something else?
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.040]   - I think so, yeah.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:50.520]   The idea for layoffs.fyi came in March of 2020
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.060]   when COVID first hit.
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:56.360]   And I realized then that because of the shutdown orders
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.480]   in San Francisco and elsewhere,
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.880]   likely that meant a lot of businesses in tech
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.920]   were gonna have to lay off employees
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.640]   because they weren't gonna be able
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.160]   to keep operating as usual.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.760]   Think kind of companies like Uber and Yelp and Airbnb
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:15.400]   and so on that rely on in-person business.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.240]   If the economy shut down,
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.720]   they're not gonna have any customers anymore.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:24.520]   And so I expected that there were gonna be an uptick
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.680]   in layoffs coming from companies like those.
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.960]   And meanwhile, I knew that there were other businesses
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.080]   like human interest that were still hiring
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.000]   and still looking to grow.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.320]   And so the idea for layoffs and FYI came by thinking,
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.160]   if I can get more visibility to those layoffs,
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:45.400]   then maybe companies who are still fortunate to be hiring
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:48.240]   could hire the employees that are being laid off.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.600]   - So there's synergies there.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:53.280]   - Help these laid off employees find a new role more quickly
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.420]   and at the same time, help these companies
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.440]   who are always struggling to find good talent,
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.000]   here was their opportunity to be able
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.600]   to fill those open roles.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:08.040]   I was in the early days of my paternity leave,
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.160]   Ellis was just born the month before.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:14.080]   So I was not looking to start a new business by any means
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:18.280]   and kind of just created this website as a weekend project
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.320]   as sort of my way of trying to do some good
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.740]   in a very scary and uncertain environment
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.760]   that was early COVID.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.200]   But yeah, the intention was never to make any money off
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.540]   of it or to turn into a business.
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:34.520]   It was just something I thought would be helpful.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.400]   And so I made it and unfortunately,
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.360]   I've continued to keep it running three years later
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:44.760]   because tech layoffs have continued to last
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:45.720]   beyond the pandemic.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.540]   And in fact, the past few quarters,
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:51.000]   they've been higher than they were even
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   in the early pandemic.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.800]   And so I've had to keep the site up and running
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:00.240]   and I continue to do so as long as it helps people,
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.720]   even if there's no monetary incentive behind it.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.040]   - Yeah.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.760]   No, it's interesting.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.940]   I think we try to look to the future.
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:12.720]   In San Francisco, in my experience has always bounced back.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.960]   I was here for the 2000 dot-com bust
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.960]   and it was really dead for two, three years.
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:22.560]   So dead, it was crazy, 2001, 2002, 2003,
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.620]   but it roared back.
[00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:28.200]   Do you believe that San Francisco will roar back
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:30.740]   with the hype of artificial intelligence?
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:35.760]   - I do think that the Bay Area will bounce back.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:39.160]   The tech sector as a whole for sure will bounce back.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:42.520]   I wasn't around here during the dot-com boom and crash,
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:45.000]   but I know that we have been through,
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.600]   this is now kind of a third boom and bust cycle, right?
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:51.600]   If you think about sort of 2001 with the dot-com boom
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:54.440]   and bust, if you think about 2008, 2009
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:57.140]   with the great recession, great financial crisis,
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:02.060]   and now kind of the current tech downturn,
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:04.680]   every time we've been through one of these,
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.500]   tech has actually come back stronger than ever before
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.280]   because there's so much long-term potential in tech
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.820]   to help improve society.
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:16.320]   And I know there's places where technology
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:17.740]   may actually be harmful
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.660]   and there's certainly some downsides to technology,
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:23.620]   but overall, if you just look at kind of how technology
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:26.340]   has fundamentally changed society for the better,
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:29.660]   it's been very awe-inspiring to me.
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:33.120]   And there's still, I think, plenty of opportunity left,
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.580]   and whether it's AI or something else,
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.820]   for technology to keep improving productivity
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.740]   in people's lives.
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:41.860]   And so I'm a strong believer in that,
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:43.700]   and I do believe that at some point
[00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.540]   we will emerge from the downturn
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.900]   and tech will once again become stronger than ever
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.740]   and hopefully the Bay Area with it.
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:50.780]   - Yeah, I hope so.
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:51.900]   I hope for both of our sakes,
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:54.380]   'cause I plan to be here for another 10 years,
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:57.060]   and I'm assuming you will as well, right?
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:58.620]   - Mm-hmm, yep.
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:58:59.620]   - All right, Roger, well,
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:01.980]   it's been a great hour chatting with you.
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:03.260]   I really appreciate your time,
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:06.300]   and congratulations for building such a successful company
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:08.380]   and trying to figure things out with your life
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:11.180]   and being a father and spending time with your family more.
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.380]   And also, best of luck with your new endeavor.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.340]   If people want to see what you're up to,
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:18.660]   where should they check out?
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:21.740]   - So you can visit comprehensive.io.
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:23.180]   That's the compensation site
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:25.020]   that's got actually some free data
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:27.540]   on what companies are paying their employees.
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:32.260]   And then layoffs.fyi if you're looking to track
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.900]   the layoff activity in the tech sector,
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:37.340]   or humaninterest.com if you're looking for a 401k
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.340]   for your business.
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:39.300]   - That's awesome.
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:41.980]   Good job, Roger, and I'll see you around.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:42.820]   - All right, appreciate it.
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:43.980]   Thanks for the kind words.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:44.820]   - Take care.
