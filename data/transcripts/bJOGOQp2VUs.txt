[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:13.580]   Paul's epistle to the Galatians in chapter 6 and verse 14, the 14th verse in the 6th
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:22.860]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians, "But God forbid that I should glory, save
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:33.260]   in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.560]   unto the world."
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:43.220]   Now here the great apostle makes one of his mightiest declarations of his faith and of
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.980]   his position.
[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.380]   He puts it in terms of glorying; he's contrasting himself with certain other people to whom
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:00.940]   he's been referring and of whom he says that they glory in the flesh.
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:09.700]   And contrasting himself with them he says, "But God forbid that I should glory in anything
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.380]   save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.220]   Now it's very interesting that the great apostle should have put it like this.
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.860]   This term about glorying, or better translated perhaps, boasting, is one that he's very
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.900]   fond of using.
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.180]   In writing to the Corinthians in the first epistle, in the first chapter, he says, "He
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:40.620]   that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord; he that makes his boast, let him make it in
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.620]   the Lord."
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.660]   It's a very good way of approaching this whole subject of life.
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.260]   A man rarely tells us all about himself when he tells us what it is in which he glories.
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.260]   We all glory in something, we're all proud of something, we all boast of something.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.980]   And you can tell exactly where a man is by the thing of which he boasts.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.820]   Take this very apostle Paul, who wrote this letter to the Galatians.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.760]   There was a time when he used to boast in something very different from the cross of
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.820]   Christ.
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:26.860]   He used to boast of the fact that he was an Israelite, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, of
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.300]   the tribe of Benjamin, circumcised the eighth day.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.140]   A man who was an expert in his knowledge of the law, a highly religious man, and so on.
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.060]   He used to boast of all that, he was very proud of it.
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.940]   He was an intense man, he was a passionate man, always, this apostle Paul.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.260]   And he let it be known always what it was he really believed in, and what he made his
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260]   boast in.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.980]   And that is how he once used to be.
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.100]   But what he's telling us here now is that all that is finished, God forbid that I should
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.420]   glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.100]   Very well, let's look at this again.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.820]   Some of us have been looking at this, who meet here regularly, Sunday by Sunday from
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.300]   three previous Sunday evenings.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.020]   We go on with our study of it tonight.
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.500]   And I feel that this is a particularly appropriate question for us to have before us on this
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.380]   particular night, Remembrance Night.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.380]   It's a kind of national night, when we in this country think of two world wars, and
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.980]   when people in other countries are doing very much the same thing.
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.860]   And so the most appropriate question for us to consider tonight is, what are you bursting
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.540]   in?
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.820]   What are you proud of?
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.580]   That tells us exactly where we all stand, we've already been able to see, that the
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.460]   differentiating mark of the Christian is that he is a man who centers his whole thinking
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:14.300]   and makes his burst of, and is moved most deeply by, the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.920]   That's what tells us whether we are Christians or not.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.420]   Now there are many people who think they are Christians and who are not Christians.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.380]   I'm not saying that, the Bible says that, and we know that that has been true throughout
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.380]   the centuries.
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.980]   There are people who think they are Christians simply because they are born in a particular
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.060]   country and things of that kind.
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.820]   But you see, this is the test.
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.960]   What do you burst in?
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.820]   If you burst more in Great Britain than in the cross of Christ, well there's no need
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.820]   to argue about it, you're not a Christian.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.820]   Does that sound drastic?
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.820]   No, that is Christian teaching.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.160]   The Apostle Paul used to burst to the fact that he was a Hebrew.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.340]   He didn't afterwards.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.460]   He was still glad that he was.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.540]   It doesn't derogate from his appreciation of being a member of the family of God's
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.580]   children on earth, even in a physical sense, but you mustn't boast of it.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.180]   It mustn't be the big thing.
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.480]   It mustn't be the thing that moves you most of all.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.320]   It mustn't be the first thing.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.780]   So you see, this comes to us as a very thorough test.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:24.420]   The Christian is a man who makes his burst to glory in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.420]   Why does he do so?
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.900]   We've considered a number of reasons.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.960]   He does so because he knows that it is by the cross that he is saved.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.900]   By or through whom we read here, the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.340]   It is the death upon the cross that saves us.
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.420]   And we considered what that meant then, but he glories in it because he looks at it merely
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.420]   as a spectacle.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.420]   It's incomparable.
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.180]   Now, comparisons are odious, I quite agree.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.860]   And yet, you know, we've got to make comparisons.
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.500]   The world is very fond of spectacles.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.380]   It's fond of great events.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.380]   There are great moments in national history belonging to practically every country in
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.380]   the world.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.740]   And great heroes, men, have done remarkable deeds and so on.
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.940]   And people like to look at these and to read about them and to look at them and to meditate
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.380]   upon them and to rejoice in them and to make their burst in them.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:31.300]   All I'm saying is this, that when one sees something of the real meaning of what happened
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:38.220]   when the Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross on Calvary's hill, everything else recedes
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.620]   in significance.
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.540]   Indeed, it pales into insignificance.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.420]   If only we really did understand what it meant to the Son of God when he died there in that
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.660]   terrible manner upon that cross.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.180]   As Isaac Watts has reminded us, there's only one inevitable result.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.940]   My richest gain I count but loss, and poor contempt on all my pride.
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.580]   And then we went on to see, Father, how the cross is a revelation of the character of
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:20.020]   the eternal God, how it shows us and displays to us the attributes of God, God's eternal
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:26.980]   wisdom, God's plan for this world and the whole cosmos, God's justice, righteousness,
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:35.660]   holiness, yes, and thank God, his love and mercy and compassion, commiseration with us,
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.660]   his long-suffering.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:43.140]   But the perfection of the plan, the way he devised, whereby anybody could be saved, the
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.260]   moment you begin to see something of that as you survey the wondrous cross, well, nothing
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.540]   again can stand before that, in your estimate, it's a sheer impossibility.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.380]   But now we must go further.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:01.420]   The Apostle tells us also that he glories in the cross because of what it has done to
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.300]   him and what it has done for him.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.900]   God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:15.140]   world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.780]   Now, here is a new aspect of the matter.
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.940]   He glories in it, I say, because of what it does to him, and this is the thing that he
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.820]   singles out particularly.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:32.340]   He says, "I'm glorying in this cross because that's the thing that's crucified the world
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.260]   unto me."
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.580]   To crucify means to kill, to put to death, to render inoperative, it's like the crucifixion
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:45.740]   of our Lord himself, he expired upon the cross, he gave up the ghost, he died and his body
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.220]   was taken down and buried.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:55.020]   Now he says that same cross crucifies, kills, the world as far as I'm concerned.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.900]   It removes it.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.500]   But why does he glory in this particular fact?
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:08.780]   Why does the Apostle glory in the fact that the world has been crucified unto him?
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.980]   By the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.140]   Well now, my friends, this is a most vital matter for us on Remembrance Day.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.460]   Indeed, it's the only true way to understand Remembrance Day.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.980]   This is the Christian statement concerning a day such as this.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.300]   Why is this important, I say?
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:41.140]   Well, I can put it like this, the world and all that it stands for is the main cause of
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:48.180]   the tragedies that have happened in the history of the world that we are commemorating tonight.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:55.220]   It is the world and everything that that represents and stands for that has produced the two world
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.500]   wars.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:05.140]   It is the world that produces all our trials and troubles and tribulations.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:11.820]   Now that is the essence of the biblical teaching from the very beginning to the very end.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.340]   It is the world itself that is responsible for its condition.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:22.860]   Now, you see, this is how the Christian approaches Remembrance Day.
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:29.740]   I am not here tonight to preach on courage, military prowess, patriotism.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.020]   No, no, that's not Christian preaching.
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.320]   You don't need to be a Christian to do that sort of thing.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.320]   That's not Christianity.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:48.180]   Nor is it an occasion for appealing to people to come together, to forget all their differences,
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.860]   lift up this old country out of our present troubles.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.140]   No, no, that's not Christian preaching.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:11:00.460]   Indeed, it may sometimes and very often is be the very opposite of true Christian preaching.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.620]   This is Christian preaching.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:09.500]   To show us the cause of our troubles, because until you are clear about the cause, you'll
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:15.100]   never get a cure, the first thing you've got to do is to diagnose.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:20.420]   And all the talk and the writing comes to nothing because they've never really understood
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.260]   why things are as they are, and what is the cause of our troubles.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.780]   And the answer that is given here by the Apostle in this great statement is this.
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.380]   "Thank God," he says, "that the cross has delivered me from the world."
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.380]   Why?
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.220]   Well, the world is the cause of all my troubles by nature.
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.340]   And that's why any man should glory in anything that delivers him from it.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:49.180]   And the only thing that does deliver him from it is the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.340]   Now then, let me put this matter to you.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.940]   According to the teaching of the Bible, there are only two sorts of people in this world.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.700]   They are the people who glory in the cross, and the people who don't glory in the cross.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.460]   But let me put that in a different way tonight.
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.580]   There are only two types of people in the world.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.380]   There are those who belong to the world, and who are men of the world, and who glory in
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.380]   their faith.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:19.020]   And those who glory in the fact that they no longer are of the world, though they're
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:27.620]   still in it, but that they are but strangers and pilgrims, travelers and journeymen passing
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.180]   through this world of time.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:35.640]   Now that is the fundamental proposition of the whole of the Bible.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.220]   There is this great division of mankind, and any other divisions are quite irrelevant.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.300]   It doesn't matter what the color of your skin is, it doesn't matter what your country is,
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.260]   it doesn't matter what your nationality is, it doesn't matter whether you're wealthy or
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.580]   poor or learned or ignorant, nothing matters but just this.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:55.700]   Are you a man of the world, or are you a man of God?
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.340]   It's one or the other.
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.020]   You see, there was a fundamental division in the whole of the human race way back at
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.020]   the beginning.
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.060]   We saw it in chapter 4 of Genesis.
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.260]   You're either like Abel, or you're like Cain.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.100]   Cain's the man of the world, Abel is the man of God.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:14.060]   And ever since there has been that great division.
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:21.500]   Now the Bible goes further and says this, that every one of us by nature is born into
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:28.780]   this world as belonging to the world, as a man of the world.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.420]   All of us are born like that.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.980]   None of us are born Christians, none of us are born without sin.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.460]   We are all born in sin, we are all shaped in iniquity.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.660]   We are all born the children of Adam, the fallen men.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:46.100]   And therefore we are all born as children of the world.
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:51.860]   Now there is a very striking statement of this in the 17th Psalm, where this term actually
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.500]   is used.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.100]   The psalmist in verse 14 of that 17th Psalm puts it like this, "From men which are thy
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:04.220]   hand, O Lord, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.620]   belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure, they are full of children."
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:15.100]   He wants to be delivered from such men, men of the world who have their portion in this
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.100]   life.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:22.940]   Now we are all by nature, I say, of that type and of that category.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:31.100]   The whole of humanity fell in Adam, and so we are all born with this bias against God
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.380]   and towards the world.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:41.300]   And what the apostle tells us at this point is this, that he glories in the cross and
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:48.140]   he thanks God for it because this is the thing that has taken him from the world where he
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.100]   was and put him into an entirely new position.
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.780]   It has crucified the world unto him, and he in turn is crucified unto the world.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.380]   Very well, what does the world mean?
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:06.220]   What does it mean to say that a man is a man of the world and not a man of God?
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.420]   This is the thing that men burst off, isn't it?
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.220]   They don't do it so much now perhaps as I remember them doing it forty and fifty years
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.060]   ago when it was more popular for people to go to places of worship.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.020]   And the really up-to-date men then was the men who said, "No, I never go near a place
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.100]   of worship now, I'm a man of the world."
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.420]   And he was proud of it.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.420]   Man of the world.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.540]   There are so many of them today that of course there's nothing to boast about.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.420]   It's more of an exception not to be a man of the world by now.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.500]   But what does it mean?
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.440]   What is this man of the world?
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.380]   What is the world in this context?
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.940]   I have simply to refer you to those words which we read at the beginning.
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.860]   Well, we read in that first epistle of John in the second chapter in the fifteenth verse
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:54.300]   these words, "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world."
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:16:00.140]   If any men love the world, the love of the father is not in him.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.380]   Now what does this mean?
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:07.540]   Well, it's quite simple, let me put it like this to you.
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:12.300]   It doesn't mean the material universe, of course, it doesn't mean that.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.300]   What does it mean then?
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.540]   Well, it means an outlook and a point of view.
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.500]   The world in the Bible always means that.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.980]   Sometimes the context makes it plain that it does mean the actual physical universe
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.620]   round and about us, the material universe, but here it doesn't.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:32.900]   The world means an outlook, a point of view.
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.340]   It really means this.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:44.140]   It means life viewed and thought of and lived apart from God, apart from the father.
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.920]   If any men love the world, the love of the father is not in him.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.920]   So that gives us our definition.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:56.940]   The world is that view of life and death and of man and of time and of everything else
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.620]   entirely apart from God and his revelation as given in the Bible.
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.620]   That is the world.
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:10.980]   The world is that collection of people who think about all these things entirely apart
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:16.300]   from God and without God.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.960]   That is the Biblical definition of what is meant by the world.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:29.060]   You see, the apostle includes in this definition human thinking, so-called philosophy.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:34.480]   It doesn't matter what form it takes, whether it is abstract or whether it's scientific,
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.120]   it doesn't matter at all.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.960]   All thinking about men and his problems and about the world and the ultimate and life
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:47.840]   and death and all these things I say, all thinking which doesn't bring in God and
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:54.040]   isn't governed by God's revelation, that's the world.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.960]   The apostle says the world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.600]   He means this, that men by searching cannot find God, and he didn't, he's tried to,
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.440]   he can't, it's impossible.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:10.280]   He says where is the wise, where is the disputer of this world, let him come forward and speak.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:18.520]   You see, he's contrasting a thinking which excludes God and his revelation with the thinking
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:25.100]   that is based solely and entirely upon God's revelation and supremely in our Lord Jesus
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.620]   Christ.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.480]   So that is what is meant by the world.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:36.160]   The outlook, the thinking, and then in turn, of course, the behavior that is entirely human,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.920]   it is entirely earthly, that entirely belongs to time.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.760]   The apostle Paul has a wonderful description of this in the second chapter of his epistle
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.760]   to the Ephesians.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.400]   He says, "Ye were thee quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:54.700]   past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.120]   power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience."
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:04.720]   You see, he says it's a life lived according to the course of this world.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.640]   Now that is what he means by the world.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:16.000]   It is that outlook upon everything that is bound entirely by human thinking and human
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.880]   ability.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.360]   And you see, it covers a very wide range.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.720]   There are these learned infidel philosophers, yes, but they're men of the world, they belong
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.840]   to the world.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.360]   Then you come right to the other extreme, and you get the kind of thinking that is determined
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.680]   by the television and the radio and the cinema.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.960]   Well, that's all right, it belongs to the same category, that's a philosophy of life.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.480]   They don't use these magical scientific terms, and they don't talk about the absolute and
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.920]   things like that, but it's a philosophy of life.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.520]   It's got its teaching, it's got its point of view, it says this is the way to live,
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.660]   that is quite as much a philosophy as the other one.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.660]   And it equally belongs to the world.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.980]   God doesn't come into either.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.460]   Very well, then, here is our definition of the world, and so I can sum it up by putting
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.100]   it like this.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:14.060]   It's that outlook which puts men at the center.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.180]   It makes men the ultimate authority.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.580]   It is the view which says there is nothing but this world.
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.780]   Men of the world who have their portion in this life, that's the worldly outlook, that's
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.980]   the mind of the world, that's the mind that's controlling the masses of people, it's the
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.780]   mind that controls all who are not Christians.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:41.680]   You see, this is the position, man is the center, man with his ability and understanding.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.940]   Everything revolves around man.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:50.820]   The supernatural is entirely discounted, they don't believe in it, there's nothing supernatural,
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.540]   nothing miraculous, nothing which is spiritual.
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:59.820]   There is nothing apart from what we know, what we can understand, what we can grasp,
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.860]   what we do, what we decide, what we determine.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.740]   That is what is meant by the word.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:13.300]   It makes man the center of the universe, and he is the first and the last word upon everything.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:19.220]   Man is his own authority, there is nothing above and beyond man.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:26.260]   And man's life is confined entirely and completely to this world of time.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.660]   When a man dies, that's the end, there's nothing beyond it.
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:34.500]   That is the view of the men of the world, that is the worldly outlook.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:42.140]   Very well, God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:50.420]   by whom the world is crucified unto me.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.460]   He is proud of the fact that he has been delivered from that way of thinking.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.460]   Why?
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:22:00.820]   Well, we'll see more when we consider, secondly, the characteristics of that world.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.740]   What are the characteristics of this world and of this outlook which I've been describing?
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.220]   There's no difficulty, we've got our definition there in that first epistle of John and in
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.540]   the second chapter.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:16.780]   For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:22.780]   pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.020]   That's it.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.820]   Let's look at this, my friends.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.940]   You see, we are here, we are met together on Remembrance Sunday.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.640]   People are thinking of the two world wars, and the terrible loss of life, and all the
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:42.220]   blood and the lust, and the carnage, and the horror, and the misery, and the unhappiness.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.300]   But what's the cause of it?
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:53.260]   And the answer of the Bible is not the Kaiser, not Mussolini, not Hitler, not your Stalins,
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.380]   nobody, except the world itself.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:02.280]   It's this outlook, it's this non-Christian view of everything, that's the cause of it.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.720]   And that's why this is so tremendously important.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.720]   What's its characteristic?
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.920]   It's characterized by lust.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.920]   What is lust?
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.420]   Well, lust is a strong desire.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:19.320]   And what the Bible says everywhere about this worldly life, is that it is a life that is
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.760]   controlled by desire.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.820]   Oh, of course, I know, the clever people won't have this, they say that they're governed
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.800]   only by their intellects.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:33.520]   All right, my friends, but let's be practical, let's be honest, let's be frank with one
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.040]   another, what the non-Christian says about the Christian is, he says, "Ah, it's one
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.800]   thing to talk, but what you do, all right, let's apply that to them."
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:46.200]   They say they're living a life purely in the intellect, are they?
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.680]   Well I think the answer's to be seen in the newspapers.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:55.080]   It doesn't matter how great their brains are, they're governed by desire and by lust, like
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.300]   everybody else.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.300]   But what does this mean?
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:06.520]   Well, it means what the psychologists call urges or drives.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.960]   Man's a creature with tremendous urges in him.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:15.280]   He's been made like that, he's got these primitive instincts in him, and they're powerful.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.360]   And when a man is a man of the world, they're more powerful than his mind.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:25.040]   I can't believe that a sane man would deliberately get drunk, but men do get drunk.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:30.000]   I can't believe that a man really controlled by his brain would deliberately smash another
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.440]   man's marriage and cause intense misery to innocent little children, but people do that
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.760]   sort of thing, and very clever people do that sort of thing, that lust.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.240]   It's lust that makes them do it.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:47.320]   Very well, it's passion, it's desire, it's these tremendous drives that are more powerful
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.520]   than all our reason.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.860]   We know it's wrong and still we do it, we like it.
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:58.140]   These are the things, the lust, inordinate affection, and he classifies it.
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.460]   The lust of the flesh.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.460]   What does that mean?
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.140]   Well, it means this, you see, he says this life of the world that is so opposite to the
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:13.380]   life of God, the life of the Father, is a life that lives mainly for the body.
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.380]   Lust of the flesh.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:20.140]   Oh, I needn't keep you, we all know all about it, and if we didn't know about it in personal
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.660]   experience you can't evade it as you walk about the streets of London and look at the
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.660]   hoardings and look at the way people are living and listen to what they're talking about.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.660]   Lust of the flesh.
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.660]   What are people living for?
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.840]   They live to eat and to drink.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.420]   You're not a man if you don't drink, of course you're not.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.860]   Doesn't the television tell you that repeatedly?
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:44.860]   No, I might, I don't only mean the entertainment, I don't mean only the drama, the plays.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.380]   You look at these great people meeting, always the glass in the hand, and you can't shake
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:50.900]   hands with this glass.
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:55.700]   Of course, if you don't drink you're not a man, this makes a man a man.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.700]   This is life.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:05.700]   Drink, alcohol, stimulus, lust of the flesh, body, eating and drinking, the fuss and the
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:11.320]   attention that's paid to all this, and of course, sex.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.660]   This is a sex-ridden generation.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.840]   It's a sex-ridden world.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.580]   You can't get away from it, it's everywhere.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:24.460]   Sex, it's an obsession, it's governing people, it's everything.
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.100]   This is the great interest.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.260]   Any lurid details about people's personal lives, which suggest something along this,
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.260]   everybody buys it.
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:37.100]   This is the thing that sells, that's lust, lust of the flesh.
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.260]   See, this is the way of the world.
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.820]   Now, John wrote this, you know, 1900 years ago, but he might very well have written it
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.500]   last night.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.940]   It's such a perfect description of the world still.
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.340]   This is life apart from God.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.540]   You see, we are 20th century people, we are very clever, we've advanced fancy comparing
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:57.760]   us with people who lived in the first century, but my dear friend, if you're living exactly
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.060]   as they did and think as they did, where's the difference?
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.860]   There is none.
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.940]   Man remains exactly what he's always been.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.980]   But then, he says, the lust of the eyes also.
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:10.980]   What's this?
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.740]   Well, this is a very subtle bit of analysis, this.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.820]   This is very profound psychology.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.220]   Lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.220]   What's this?
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:23.780]   Ah, this is the worship of appearance, the shell, the pump.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.220]   It's everything external as opposed to the heart.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:32.020]   Our Lord turned to the Pharisees one afternoon and he said, "Ye are they that justify yourselves
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:37.260]   before men, but God judges the heart, and that which is highly esteemed amongst men
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.660]   is abominable in the sight of God."
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:45.820]   The eyes, what can be seen, the external, and of course the whole world is living along
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.140]   this very line at the present time.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:56.340]   What it really means is this, it's sham, it's pretence, it's dishonest.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:03.740]   Isn't this one of the great characteristics of the whole of life today?
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:08.620]   There was a time when there was some meaning or sense in the term "good-looking."
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.660]   There isn't by now.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:18.820]   What you see is the paint and the powder, the make-up, that's the lust of the eyes.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.000]   It's not true, it's not honest.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.620]   You don't see the natural color of the hair, it's turned to something else, it's an appearance.
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.020]   It sounds trivial, doesn't it?
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.020]   But it's very profound.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:34.100]   You see, this is the view of life, everything to give an appearance.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.500]   It doesn't correspond to the facts and to the reality.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.860]   It's the paint and the powder, not the broken heart that's behind it, it's the appearance
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.220]   of joviality.
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:49.060]   It's dishonest, it's the lie that's being enacted.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:52.820]   Again our Lord put it in terms of those Pharisees.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:29:01.580]   He says, "You keep clean and wash the outside of the cup and the platter, but inside, what
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:09.260]   do you find there, there's all filth, ravening, there is everything that is foul.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:14.020]   The outside looks so wonderful, but don't look inside, there you'll see the dirt and
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.020]   the filth.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.020]   It hasn't been cleaned.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:21.140]   As long as it looks marvelous, the appearance, and everybody's living for appearance, house,
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:26.660]   car, appearance, color, and all these things, these are the things, lust of the flesh, lust
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:32.500]   of the eyes, and then to cap it all, the pride of life, and they all go together.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:37.980]   Cutting a great figure in this world, that's the thing, ambition, pride, the desire to
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:44.020]   get on, these are the things in which people burst, pride of life, the desire for applause,
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:49.140]   the desire to get on, the desire to see your name in a paper, or standing outside some
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:56.660]   building, this lust, pride of life, wanting to be great and important, and the whole world
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.540]   is after it.
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:07.140]   Now, you see, this is the biblical analysis of the worldly man and his life, this life
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.620]   which is lived apart from God, which people think is so clever today.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:16.220]   This is the thing for which they've left Christianity, the lust of the flesh and the
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:20.660]   lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, but my dear friends, while I'm working through
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.780]   this analysis to bring you to this point, this is what makes it so terrible.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.180]   It isn't that thing in and of itself, it's what it leads to, it's bad enough in and
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.140]   of itself, but what does it lead to?
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:36.540]   And you see, what it leads to is this, it leads to lack of order, to lack of discipline,
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.620]   it leads to lawlessness, it leads to license.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.760]   That was the whole sin of Cain at the very beginning, he took the law into his own hands,
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:49.180]   he was annoyed with God, his brother had kept God's law, there must be a blood sacrifice,
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.340]   he hadn't done so, God points it out to him, he could have been forgiven, he's told that
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:57.280]   he can find a sin offering, but he doesn't, and he's annoyed, and he rebels, he takes
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:04.100]   the law into his own hand, and he murders his brother.
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:11.580]   And that is what that worldly outlook always leads to, it is lawlessness, it is license.
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:16.400]   Every man becomes his own authority, and so the thing is, why shouldn't I?
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.960]   Isn't that our great problem in this country today?
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.980]   Isn't that why morality is breaking down around and about us?
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.980]   Why not, they say?
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:23.980]   Why shouldn't I?
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.980]   Couldn't care less.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.580]   What's it matter what the Bible says, what's it matter what the mid-Victorian says, what's
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.660]   it matter what the philosopher says, what's it matter what anybody says?
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:36.260]   If I want to, why shouldn't I?
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:42.580]   Taking the law into your own hands, that's lust, that's desire controlling, that's
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:47.540]   complete lawlessness and utter indiscipline.
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:58.800]   And of course, this desire to gratify ourselves brings in its train things like jealousy.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:03.020]   Jealous of somebody whose pride of life looks a bit better than yours, or who gets more
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:06.580]   admiration than you do.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.560]   Jealousy of somebody who does better than you do, in the same profession, or in the
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:13.060]   same business, or who has a better car, pride of life.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.600]   And people can't sleep at night, they're jealous, they're envious.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.180]   This is life, this is the world.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:24.340]   Did you think, my friend, that this Christianity and its preaching was just a little bit of
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:29.300]   sob stuff, and that I stood in this pulpit to tell pleasant little stories, and we sang
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.900]   nice hymns, and we didn't face life?
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.900]   I am asking you to face life at this moment in a way that nothing else in the world asks
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:41.100]   you to do.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:46.380]   Jealousy and envy, malice and spite and hatred, it doesn't stop at that.
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:50.220]   It leads to theft and robbery.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:56.540]   This lust of the flesh desires another man's wife, and it takes it, it's robbery, daylight
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.540]   robbery.
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:01.740]   We punish people who steal a shilling, we don't punish a man who steals another man's
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.100]   wife, or a wife who steals another man's husband.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:10.980]   That's the madness of our legal system.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.940]   It leads to theft and it leads to robbery.
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:18.660]   Of course, when Hitler marched into Austria and annexed it to Germany, we held up our
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.660]   hands in horror.
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.500]   The rape of Austria, we called it.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.500]   He walks in and he takes it.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.500]   We say nothing.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.780]   When a man does that in private, perhaps we even admire him.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.600]   The world seems to admire him.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.740]   It regards that as entertainment.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:38.380]   A form of entertainment is to depict a drunken man, or to depict an adulterous man, a man
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.940]   who flirts with another man's wife, or who does something he shouldn't.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:42.940]   That's entertainment.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.700]   God have mercy upon us.
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:53.620]   But you see, finally, it leads to strife, doesn't it, and in the end it leads to war.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:58.820]   When nations do this sort of thing, and nations do this sort of thing, it leads to war.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:04.180]   Wars are ultimately a strife between the haves and the have-nots.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.580]   Some big bully wants to take another bit of land.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:07.860]   The other people say, "It's ours.
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.020]   We don't want you to take it, so there's a war."
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.700]   And then one big bully's got it, another big bully says, "I want some of it."
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:18.220]   So there's a fight between the two big bullies, and so you get your whole of human history.
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:22.220]   The big, the strong and the weak, and the strong against the strong.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:27.580]   It's nothing but this lust, it's this desire, it's this lawlessness, it's this greed, it's
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:32.660]   this aggressiveness, this is the outcome of this worldly life that is characterized by
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.540]   the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:41.220]   The Apostle James writes his epistle, and he puts the question that should be put on
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:47.980]   this Remembrance Night, James 4, verse 1, "Whence come wars and fightings among you?
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:52.660]   Come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.700]   You lust and you have not, you kill and you desire to have and cannot obtain.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:01.660]   You fight and war, yet you have not, because you ask not."
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:05.780]   And there's the verdict of the Bible and the whole of human history.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.340]   And that is why the world is as it is tonight.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:12.980]   Now then my friends, that's the world, that's what it is, that's what it leads to, that's
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.860]   how it expresses itself.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:21.140]   The Apostle says, "God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:27.980]   Christ, by which that world is crucified unto me, and I've got nothing more to do with
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:28.980]   it."
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.980]   That's what he's saying.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:36.340]   How does the cross crucify the world unto us?
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:40.740]   Let me give you some answers to the question.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:46.020]   It does it first and foremost by showing us the world for what it really is.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:51.220]   There is nothing in the world tonight that shows us the real nature and character of
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.140]   the world except this book which I'm expounding to you.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:57.740]   And you get this done supremely in the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.460]   Look at it, it's quite simple.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:05.260]   The Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, but he came into this world.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:08.900]   Why did he ever come into it?
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.700]   Have you ever pondered that question?
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.420]   Why did Christ ever come into this world?
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.300]   There's only one answer.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:23.420]   Because the world is, as I've been describing it to you, it's the only answer.
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:28.660]   The world is so vile and so rotten that nothing can save it but the coming of the Son of God.
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:29.660]   That's why he came.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.820]   So his very coming opens our eyes to the state of the world.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.900]   You see, apart from him, people say, "Oh no, look here, this is too black a picture.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:37.900]   You're a pessimist."
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.380]   "My dear sir," they say, "things are not as bad as that, you know."
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:44.140]   "No, no," they say, "these things can be put right."
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.700]   I say, "How can they be put right?"
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.180]   "Well," you say, "the real trouble is that people are not sufficiently educated.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.540]   They want more education.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.900]   We really must put this Lord Robbins report into operation, then we're really going to
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:54.900]   solve our problems.
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.300]   We're going to get rid of the things you are talking about.
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.740]   Let Lord Robbins' scheme be put into operation at once!"
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.740]   And the two parties are saying, "I'm going to do it first."
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.340]   The other says, "I'm going to do it first."
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:09.700]   My dear friends, let them both do it together, the problem will still be here.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:14.860]   We've been doing that throughout the centuries, and it doesn't make the slightest difference.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:22.620]   No, no, the very fact that the Son of God ever came into this world is a pronouncement
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.420]   that this world is hopeless.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.820]   If anything could have saved this world, the law that God gave to the nation of Israel
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.060]   through Moses would have done it, but it didn't.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.820]   It completely failed.
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.580]   That's why the Son of God had to come.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:40.220]   The law is the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.940]   It was never meant to save.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.420]   It wasn't big enough to save.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:48.860]   What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:53.180]   Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemns sin in the flesh.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.500]   It's the only way.
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:59.420]   But listen, look at him when he did come into this world, look how different he was.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:05.180]   The description of him in Isaiah 52 is, "He hath no form nor comeliness that we should
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.980]   desire him.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:12.980]   His visage is marred.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:17.300]   There was nothing of the pride of life about his appearance, nothing to appeal to the lust
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.580]   of the eyes.
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.940]   And then he was meek and he was lowly.
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:26.180]   He was pure, he was clean, he was holy.
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:30.940]   He sacrificed himself, he gave himself, he served.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:37.060]   Out of glory though he was, he washed people's feet.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:42.420]   He rendered an utter and a perfect obedience to the holy law of God.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:46.100]   And it's as you look at him you see what the world is.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:51.940]   You take your great men of the world so-called, in whom we all glory and in whom we burst,
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.940]   put them by him, and they're nothing.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.660]   He condemns them all.
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.180]   What puny creatures they are by the side of him.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.100]   But then go on, let's look at this.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.060]   What did the world do to him?
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.300]   If you want to know what this world is like, look what it did to him.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.520]   Here's the son of God, he's left the courts of heaven, he's come and humbled himself,
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.620]   and he's giving himself in healing people and instructing them.
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.220]   He never did anybody any harm.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.900]   He went about doing good.
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.700]   What was the response of the world?
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.980]   It hated him.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.380]   It persecuted him.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.380]   It rejected him.
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.540]   It chose a murderer before him.
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:30.700]   It crucified him, it killed him.
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:35.540]   And there on the cross he exposes the world for what it is.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.540]   And the clever men of the world tonight are laughing at the cross, they're mocking it,
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:43.900]   they're jeering at it, they're making fun of the blood of Christ, and they're trying
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.900]   to ridicule it.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:49.020]   They're only doing what their prototypes did in the first century.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.980]   That's what the world has always done to him.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:57.460]   But you see here's another aspect.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.940]   His entire emphasis was the exact opposite of the emphasis of the world.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:08.980]   The world emphasizes, as we've been seeing, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.140]   and the pride of life.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:14.220]   What did he emphasize?
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:20.300]   And he emphasized something that the world never speaks about at all.
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:25.420]   He emphasized the soul.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:33.460]   What shall it profit a man, he said, though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:37.000]   What if you're the most handsome man or woman the world has ever known, and are dressing
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.700]   in a more gorgeous manner, and have the greatest palace, and the greatest collection of motor
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.380]   cars, and everything?
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:51.980]   What if you had the whole world, and lose your own soul?
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:56.660]   That's what he says about the world, and he says it supremely there upon the cross.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.860]   What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:01.940]   Why did he die?
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:07.260]   He died for the souls of men, not for our material welfare, not to reform this world,
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.740]   but to save our souls.
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:12.060]   The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:16.260]   And it's the soul that's lost, the thing that the world knows nothing about.
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:20.580]   But it's in you, it's in all of us, this imperishable thing in us, that goes on beyond
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.940]   death and the end.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:30.860]   No, no, he exposed the life of this world for what it really is.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:38.660]   He spoke a parable about Davies and Lazarus, the rich men in his palace, dressed gorgeously
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:44.700]   in wonderful robes, and eating with all his boon companions until he had his fill, and
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:49.540]   the poor beggar at the gate with the dogs licking his sores.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:54.220]   He says don't judge superficially, that isn't the end of the story.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:42:01.420]   He gives us a picture of Lazarus in Abram's bosom, and Davies in the torment of hell.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:05.780]   You see the difference between the mind and the outlook of the world, and the mind and
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.140]   the outlook of the Father and the Son of God?
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.400]   You see, he exposes the world for what it is.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:17.460]   The moment you meet Christ, you see the world as something that is your enemy, something
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.500]   tawdry.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:24.980]   You see that it's got the principle of death in it, and you no longer live for it,
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.300]   and you no longer boast of it.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:34.740]   The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power, and all that beauty, all that wealth air gave,
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.940]   awaits alike the inevitable hour.
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:42.820]   The paths of glory lead but to the grave, and that's the end.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.340]   But wait a minute, it isn't the end.
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:48.780]   It's the end as regards the men of the world, but it isn't the end, for our Lord in his
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.260]   cross he shows us the fate of the world.
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:56.260]   He not only shows us the character of the world, he shows us the fate that is awaiting
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.460]   it, and that is why the apostle glories in the cross.
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:03.620]   He says, "You know, love not the world, nor the things that are in the world, this
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.940]   lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life."
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:12.620]   He says, "The world passeth away, and the lust thereof."
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:16.300]   And it is passing away.
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.780]   Many things are passing away in this generation to which you and I belong.
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:26.540]   What a change any one of us who is over fifty years of age has seen during his or her lifetime.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:31.980]   The world passing away, and the glory thereof, it's dying as we're looking at it, change
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.460]   and decay in all around I see.
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:44.260]   But my dear friend, that is as nothing compared with what is going to happen to this world.
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:49.820]   The world passeth away, and the lust thereof, what's the end word?
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:54.060]   The end is judgment.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:58.380]   The whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:04.460]   Our Lord just before the cross said, "Now is the judgment of this world.
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.260]   Now shall the prince of this world be cast out."
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:12.100]   "This is the judgment of the world," he says, "I am dying, and as I die I am going
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:16.700]   to judge the world."
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.860]   The message of this book, this revelation of God from beginning to end, is that there
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:26.460]   is to be an end to the world, and it's the end of judgment.
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:30.820]   The Christ of God will come back into this world, and he'll come back to judge it.
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:35.620]   Listen to the favorite verse we are told of most people, "God so loved the world that
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:42.740]   he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.140]   everlasting life."
[00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.240]   If you believe in him you will not perish.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.580]   If you don't believe in him you will perish.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.220]   That's the statement of John 3, 16.
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.460]   The world is under judgment, and it is going to perish.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:04.100]   All that is opposed to God is going to be judged, and it's going to be destroyed.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:12.660]   There is a day coming when this whole universe will be judged by the returned Son of God.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:20.060]   And all that doesn't belong to him but belongs to the world is going to be destroyed everlastingly.
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:25.820]   There is a day coming when astonished humanity is going to hear this cry, "Babylon is fallen!
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:27.220]   Babylon is fallen!"
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.280]   What's Babylon?
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.300]   It's the world without Christ.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.080]   It's London without Christ.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.880]   It's New York without Christ.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.460]   It's all these modern infernals without Christ.
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:43.340]   Babylon the Great, Babylon is fallen, is fallen!
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:49.380]   This Babylon, which seems so great and wonderful with its palaces and its great business, and
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:53.460]   it was transacting its business with all the kings and the princes and the great of the
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.460]   earth.
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:59.240]   They all brought their merchandise to it, and they boasted, "How great this is, Babylon!"
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.980]   That's the world without Christ.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:05.580]   But the day is coming when he will judge it, and this Babylon will fall!
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.060]   It will be crushed to rubble and to nothing.
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:15.500]   It will be destroyed everlastingly.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:21.020]   Christ on the cross says, "Now is the judgment of this world."
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.520]   He prophesies what is going to come.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.620]   He is to be the judge.
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:29.900]   He will judge the world in righteousness, says the Apostle Paul to the Athenians, "By
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:34.140]   that man whom he hath appointed, whereof he hath given us assurance in that he hath raised
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.980]   him from the dead."
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:41.940]   And Revelation 20 tells us, "The books will be opened, and every man will have to stand
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:42.940]   before him.
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:47.540]   Those who died on sea, those who died on land, those who were blown to nothing in the air,
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:53.540]   all will come back and stand before him."
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:47:02.280]   And the final judgment, and the simple message of the whole of the Bible is this, that the
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:09.820]   world, everything that is opposed to God and trusts man and his own power, it's all going
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:15.820]   to be judged and condemned to everlasting misery and destruction.
[00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:22.900]   Now, you see why Paul glories in the cross?
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:29.420]   It is the cross alone that saves any one of us from that destruction which is coming to
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.140]   the world.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:36.100]   The whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:41.660]   The wrath of God is upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men that hold down the
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.700]   truth in unrighteousness.
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:47.700]   The whole world is going to be judged and going to be destroyed.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:55.640]   You're all born, we're all born in the world and of it.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:02.220]   And unless we can be separated from that world, we will share its fate.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:10.300]   God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, by which the
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.980]   world is crucified, and to me I'm separated from it.
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:14.980]   How?
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:15.980]   Oh, I'll tell you.
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:23.600]   On the cross on Calvary's Hill, the Lord Jesus Christ took the punishment upon himself,
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:29.920]   the punishment that is coming to all who belong to the world.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:35.180]   He takes the punishment upon himself, that's why he died, he was receiving the punishment
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:38.900]   of the sins of men.
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:45.020]   So you see, if you believe in him, if you've seen all I've been trying to say, and realise
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:48.980]   that there's only one way where you can be separated from the punishment of that world,
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:53.340]   namely by believing that he has borne the punishment for you, that he took your sins
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:58.300]   in his own body on the tree and has received their punishment, you are separated out of
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:03.140]   that world, so that when the destruction of the world comes, you are saved, you're not
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:07.000]   involved in it.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:14.340]   The cross of Christ separates all of us from the doom that is awaiting this evil world.
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.280]   It's the only thing that does.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.980]   The punishment must descend, as I showed you last Sunday night.
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:25.100]   The punishment has descended upon him, and if I believe in him, it will not descend on
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.100]   me.
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:33.380]   I no longer belong to the world, I belong to Christ, because, you see, he not only separates
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:37.980]   us from the world, he separates us unto himself and into his own kingdom.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:38.980]   What is a Christian?
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:43.380]   Well, Paul says to the Colossians that a Christian is a man who has been translated from the
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.920]   kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.660]   I no longer belong to the world, I belong to the kingdom of him, the kingdom of light,
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:52.460]   the kingdom of glory, the kingdom of God.
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:58.080]   Here I am, and the world has nothing to do with me, I'm not in it.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:04.220]   I'm in this other kingdom, oh, I'm still existing in this world, but I no longer belong
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:10.580]   to it, I've been translated, and my citizenship is now in him, from whence also we expect
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:15.300]   the Saviour, and we know that we shall ever go on and be to the Lord.
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:21.420]   He, by dying on the cross, separates me from the world, puts me into his own kingdom, introduces
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:30.600]   me to God, makes me a child of God, and an heir of eternal bliss.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:37.660]   So I come back and I look at the world, the world that used to fascinate me and entrench
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:42.940]   me and make me think it was so wonderful with its glittering prizes, and I vied with others
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:49.020]   and I wanted them, and I thought how marvellous to be this or that, but, oh, now, having seen
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:55.860]   him and this truth that he brings out, I look at them again and I say, "My riches gain
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:51:02.060]   I count but loss, and poor contempt on all my pride."
[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:07.420]   He delivers me from the world, "Whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:10.980]   everlasting life."
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:14.700]   He does more, he gives me a power that is greater than the world.
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.520]   Listen to John again, "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:28.140]   This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith, our faith in him."
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:35.900]   And thank God he does something else, and with this I leave you.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:44.860]   He gives us occasional glimpses of that other world, that real world, that pure, that holy
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:47.620]   world that is yet going to be.
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:57.700]   This old world can never be improved and reformed, the whole of history proves that.
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:04.140]   But when Christ comes back again to judge and to destroy his enemies, all who belong
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:09.140]   to the world and who haven't got the love of the Father in him, he will set up this
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:20.240]   new world, a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness, a renovated cosmos,
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.140]   a perfected universe with glory everywhere.
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:32.780]   The glory of the Lord shall cover everything as the waters cover the sea.
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:39.380]   And if you believe in him and in his message, if you believe that that person dying on that
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:44.060]   cross on Calvary's hill was the Lord of glory and that he was dying in order to save
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:48.420]   you and to separate you from the world and to prepare you for that glory, you will be
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:57.900]   in it and you will be glorying in it and spending your eternity with him in the glory.
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:04.700]   And once a man sees this, as the apostle Paul had come to see it, and as by the grace of
[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:16.980]   God, even I have come to see it, once a man sees it, this is what he says, "Saviour,
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:27.300]   chief of Zion's city, I through grace a member am, let the world deride or pity, I
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.380]   will glory in thy name.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:43.300]   Fading is the worldling's pleasure, all his boasted, prompt, and shown, solid joys
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:53.740]   and lasting treasure, none, but Zion's children know."
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.700]   What are you glorying in?
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:57.700]   Are you glorying in this world still?
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:01.460]   There are only two possibilities.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:08.740]   You either glory in the world in some shape or form, or else you glory in the cross of
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:16.900]   our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified unto you and you're delivered
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:26.580]   from it in time, in order that you may share that everlasting glory with him.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.740]   Amen.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.660]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
