[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.860]   Now everybody is Sam from financial samurai and I'm bringing another episode to you from my hot tub because otherwise
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.620]   I wouldn't be able to record these episodes because I'd probably just go crazy
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.600]   Writing and recording all day. I'm tired. I don't know about you guys, but mentally
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.800]   Exhausted and I'm looking forward to a better July. The stock market has been going backwards
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.060]   It's down about 8% from its June highs
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:34.000]   The real estate market it's still pretty strong below or at the median home price of your city or below
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.040]   When you get to about 50% above the median home price of your city
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.080]   That's when the real estate market is starting to slow down and you're seeing more price cuts
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.600]   Conversely, you're finding more deals
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.920]   So if you want to find more deals, you may have to look for the price point about 50%
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.180]   Higher than the median home price for your city now in this episode
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.940]   I want to talk about inflation because some of you have asked should we be concerned about inflation given that the Fed is
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.580]   Printing so much money pumping in so much money
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.840]   The government is doing all this stimulus to keep our economy afloat and the short answer is no
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.480]   I don't think we have to worry about inflation at all for the next 12 months
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.140]   Maybe 24 months and the reason why is simply that there are tens of millions of people unemployed
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.700]   And if you look at the US personal savings rate, it's skyrocketed to 33% in April and for May and June July
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700]   I'm sure it's gonna be over 20%
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.380]   Because the economy is still not fully open and when you're uncertain about the future you tend to hoard cash
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.460]   And when you hoard cash, you're not buying things which means demand is down
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.820]   Which means pricing pressure is down. So instead of worrying about inflation
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.240]   We should really worry about deflation, but I'm not worried about deflation either because I think there's a right balance going on
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.000]   Where the government and the Fed are really pumping in dollars into the economy to keep us afloat
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.260]   And if you think about a deflation, it's not so bad if you are cashed up and you're looking to buy assets
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.140]   for example if there's deflation in
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.900]   Property prices. Well, that's a good thing in terms of affordability
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.740]   Especially with mortgage rates at all-time lows if there's deflation in
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.300]   College tuition prices, that's great because they shouldn't be going up so much anyway
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.900]   And they should be going down for once goodness gracious if campuses are closed
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.340]   Why are you still charging max tuition and you saw USC raised tuition by another 3% a year. I mean, that's ridiculous
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.940]   So if you're looking to spend money and you have to spend money
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.780]   Deflation is pretty reasonable. So long as there's no stagflation where there's deflation as well as stagnation
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.940]   Then it kind of gets tricky because hey
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.620]   There's deflation your income is probably gonna go down
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.980]   Your existing assets are probably gonna lose value and so forth and it's a it could be a death spiral
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.760]   That is hard to get out of without a lot of government intervention and then on the flip side if there is inflation
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.220]   Well your existing assets will by definition inflate with inflation over time or inflate faster than inflation
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.120]   So for example stocks real estate if you could buy
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.780]   Private universities and earn the tuition dollars. They're probably going to continue to outperform
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.700]   Inflation inflation is that you should look at the Treasury bond market
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.080]   Bonds are all about inflation. They're predictors of inflation. They trade based off inflation assumptions
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.900]   and if you look back towards the late
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.060]   1980s you can see the 10-year Treasury bond yield peak and
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.720]   Gradually go down for the next 30 plus years
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.480]   And that is a signal that inflation at least here in the United States is
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.660]   Under control because everything is relative when it comes to investing in bonds and investing in stocks
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.320]   But more specifically bonds because the yield that a bond pays
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.980]   Let's say it's 3% is all related to inflation and what the opportunity cost is
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.120]   Owning the bond and owning something else. So if the bond yield is 3%
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.840]   Well inflation is probably around
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.660]   2% or 2 and a half percent because the bond yield needs to pay a higher rate of
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.100]   Inflation for an investor to own that bond. Otherwise, why would you bother right?
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.940]   It's called the risk premium the risk premium to own stocks or the risk premium to own bonds
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.280]   So let's say the bond yield declines to 2%
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.940]   Well, you can kind of guess that inflation is probably lower as well
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.300]   Inflation is probably below 2% Maybe it's 1% or 1.5%
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.260]   So that spread is the risk premium the bond risk premium you can say
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.660]   Because you need to be paid a little bit more in
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:05.660]   Interest to hold the bond for the risk of the bond not paying you back. So when it comes to US Treasuries
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.360]   Well, it's a sovereign as it can get the US Treasury bond market will pay you back
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.660]   and if it doesn't pay you back
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:20.500]   we've got bigger problems to deal with and you can move along the risk curve in the bond market and go from US Treasuries to
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.380]   Municipal bonds which are still very low risk to corporate bonds to junk bonds, right?
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.420]   And so as you move along the risk curve, these bonds will pay higher and higher yields
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.820]   But then there's higher and higher risk
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.220]   That the entity won't pay you back or won't pay you back in full after the duration is over
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.020]   So the US Treasury bond market is a great
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.300]   indicator of inflation and right now with the 10-year bond yield something at around
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.940]   0.65%
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.660]   I mean that's close to an all-time low it is signaling to the world to investors or to anybody paying attention
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.180]   That there is no inflation on the horizon
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.340]   So ten years you can only earn point six five percent a year in other words
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:15.120]   Inflation is probably no more than zero point six five percent or it's probably a little bit less
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:22.580]   Now, of course many investors are hiding out in the US Treasury bond market for safety reasons because stocks
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.980]   Well, frankly are very very volatile right now and there's just a lot of uncertainty and so investors are saying well
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:36.100]   Might as well have a little bit more certainty actually a lot more certainty in the US Treasury bond market and earn hardly anything
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.380]   Then risk losing money in the stock market
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.340]   The stock market has had a great rebound a great run since its March 23rd
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:52.260]   2020 lows and I personally believe we're probably going to be range bound over the next six months
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.260]   So we're talking maybe
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.900]   2700 to 3,250 on the SP 500
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.900]   I think there's a 70% chance that we're gonna trade in this range until there's a vaccine as a result
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.540]   I don't think anybody should be anxious or feeling that FOMO
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.060]   That they're gonna miss out on some great investment instead
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.060]   I think it's perfectly fine to stack cash to save as much cash as possible
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.420]   And if you haven't done a cash audit yet
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.780]   Go through all your various accounts and add up how much cash you have in each account
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.960]   I think you'll feel much better if you do that and also shoot to have a cash target goal
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.580]   You know by quarter or by the end of the year or by this time next year
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:42.980]   Having these cash savings goals will motivate you to save more and also make you feel better about an uncertain time period
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:49.220]   There are clearly gonna be winners and losers during any year, especially a year with so much market dislocation
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:55.860]   It's up to us to be diligent to do our research to find those winners to plan ahead
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:03.300]   I personally I'm not really excited to put new money to work in the stock market when the SP 500 is over 3,000
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.900]   Yeah, I could go to 3,200 maybe 3,300 and hit all-time highs
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:13.460]   But I just don't see that happening so soon with all that's going on
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.460]   so instead I'm just gonna continue to look for real estate deals because
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:25.100]   Inflation is low, which means mortgage rates are low and there are deals to be had on the higher end of the price curve
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:31.420]   Further I think all of us should be thinking about ways in finding ways to make more money at home
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.980]   Finding a permanent solution to make more money at home
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:42.380]   And I've been making money technically at home since my first five cent Google Adsense check came in in 2009
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.660]   And so I'm probably gonna write about this in the near near future and talk about this, of course
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.020]   All right, folks
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:54.100]   I'm gonna wrap things up and turn on the Jets and turn on the bubbles if you like this podcast
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:59.740]   I'd love a positive review the positive review will keep my podcast going
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:07.580]   In fact, I think I might wait to record another episode until I can get 200 reviews. Hopefully all positive right now
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.940]   I think there are about 186 or so reviews on iTunes. So the more the merrier
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:17.380]   I think this is a way to pace myself and to shoot for new goals and barometers and you've got to find a way to
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.980]   Pace yourself as well. The name of the game right now is survival
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.060]   Forget about trying to outperform constantly and be just a hero and everything you do, you know
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.900]   We're going to the fourth month of sheltering in place who knows exactly what will happen in the future
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:37.700]   But I think if we can survive and survive some more we're gonna come out of this. Okay
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.460]   Thanks so much everyone for your support. I'll talk to you guys later
