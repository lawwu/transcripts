[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   Okay, really quickly, tomorrow I'm going to be hosting a webinar with Noah Zreimers.
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.520]   He's the creator of Sentence Transformers.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.760]   He used to work at Hugging Face and now is the Director of Machine Learning at Cohere.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.640]   We're going to be talking about Cohere's new multilingual model.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.280]   It's incredible, supports over 100 languages and is state-of-the-art.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.640]   It's a really, really cool model.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.960]   If you're interested in multilingual applications for machine learning,
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.520]   I definitely recommend you come and take a look.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.640]   I will leave a link to the webinar registration in the comments and description below.
