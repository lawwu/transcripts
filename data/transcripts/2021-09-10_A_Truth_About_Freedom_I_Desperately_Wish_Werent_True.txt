[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.380]   My name is Josh Rasheeds.
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.380]   Today on the show, I want to share with you
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.380]   a simple and yet I believe under-discussed truth.
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.520]   This is a truth that I myself have resisted quite vigorously.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.560]   This is a truth that I have never wanted
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.260]   to acknowledge as true.
[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.160]   This is a truth that I wish were not true.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.560]   And yet at this point in my life,
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.560]   I have to concede that I believe this is true.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.940]   I believe that this is an enduring truth
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.840]   that has really probably never really changed.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.340]   And at this point in time,
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.080]   I don't think it has much chance of changing.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.720]   Here is the truth.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.080]   If you desire to live a lifestyle of freedom,
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.080]   to have the highest levels of personal freedom,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.780]   the highest levels of personal choice,
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.840]   to be able to do the things that you wish to do,
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.300]   to live in the way that you believe is right,
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.960]   if that is your desire,
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.600]   then you have virtually no option
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   other than to dedicate yourself to becoming rich,
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.000]   to dedicate yourself to becoming financially wealthy.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Now, hear me clearly, I do not like that that is true.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.660]   I long for a world in which that's not true.
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.600]   I wish for systems of community and culture and government
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.040]   to be dedicated to justice, equal justice for all
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.880]   so that all are equal before the law.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.360]   I wish for systems that acknowledge individual sovereignty
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.560]   and individual rights.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.540]   I wish for a society that supports that.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.160]   I have, like many people,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.720]   engaged in the pursuit of those societies
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.760]   and arguments about how, yes, they really do exist
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.920]   or they really should exist
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.400]   or here's how we can make them to exist.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.680]   What I haven't observed is,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.520]   while I am not without hope that perhaps one day
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.640]   a society like that might exist,
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.960]   in fact, I genuinely believe that one day
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.640]   in the fullness of time it will exist,
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.160]   however, at this point in time, it does not seem to exist.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.080]   But along the way, when you analyze most of the choices
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.160]   that you want to make,
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.540]   what you will see is that if you are wealthy,
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.580]   you have vastly higher levels of personal freedom of choice.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.540]   I wanna give some examples to drive this home to you
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.980]   and indicate to you that,
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.160]   while I'm intentionally using words like wealthy,
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.840]   that this is a sliding scale of freedom.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.540]   If you're a little bit more wealthy
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.360]   than you were previously, you have a few more choices.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.960]   If you are infinitely more wealthy than you were previously,
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.060]   you have abundantly more choices.
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.980]   But I believe that it's important that you acknowledge
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.980]   that building financial wealth is an integral part
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.700]   of your pursuing personal freedom.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.860]   It's not optional.
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.540]   There are good arguments to be made in the opposite.
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.620]   For example, I myself have done shows.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.220]   I did a show one time
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.000]   talking about the famous philosophical saying
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   where there's the king's servant,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   two of the king's philosopher's servants
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.580]   are talking to each other.
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.380]   And one of the servants sees the other servant
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.580]   eating a simple bowl of lentils for his meal.
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.960]   And he says, "Listen, if you would just learn
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.000]   "to please the king,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.520]   "then you wouldn't have to live on lentils."
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.780]   To which the second philosopher's servant responds,
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.320]   "If you would learn to live on lentils,
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.720]   "you wouldn't have to please the king."
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.360]   There's a whole show on that.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.580]   I believe that's true, right?
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.740]   The man who has the simplest of desires in some cases
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.420]   can be freer than the man in many cases is simply freer
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.640]   because he has simpler desires
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.420]   and thus he's able to take more risks.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.220]   I think a lot of times we like to wax poetic
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.460]   about the lifestyle of those who don't have anything.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.580]   I often do find myself admiring those people.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.200]   I enjoy admiring people who can do well on little.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.480]   But when you actually get down to it,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.100]   you don't have more freedom just because you have little.
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.280]   You do have more freedom when your desires are less,
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.340]   but you have more freedom when you have resources.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.300]   You have more freedom when you have options.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.140]   Give an example.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.340]   Okay.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.740]   I am currently at the moment in the nation of France.
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.140]   I've been here for a few weeks.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.180]   And I wanted to come to France
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.380]   because my plan had been for a significant amount of time
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.020]   to spend the summer in France,
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.700]   working on my own French skills and abilities
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.140]   and helping my children,
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.760]   collecting books and literature in French for them,
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.300]   and just having an opportunity
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.500]   to spend some time in France.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.480]   It's such a beautiful place, lovely country,
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.480]   tremendous history, very appealing culture.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.460]   There's just so many things that I like about France.
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.420]   So we came here.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.860]   And of course, traveling anywhere is difficult right now.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.580]   And that travel is often frustrating,
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.880]   but I've dealt with it.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.020]   I've chosen places that were freer.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.380]   And I knew coming to Europe that I was going into a place
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.900]   that was perhaps less free.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.040]   But after studying the different laws and things,
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.100]   I decided, you know what?
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.100]   There's gonna be enough freedom.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.620]   And there really was.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.460]   There really was.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.100]   We spent time on the island nation of Malta,
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.500]   spent time in Spain, spent time in Portugal, Andorra,
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.860]   significant levels of freedom.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.220]   The coronavirus restrictions were not much of a problem.
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.660]   Obviously, we had to have the appropriate tests
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.820]   and paperwork to get in,
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.460]   but generally it wasn't a problem.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.100]   Until that is, we got to France.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.860]   And my wife did not want to come to France
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.100]   because she wants nothing to do with the,
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.100]   here, the pass sanitaire, the health pass
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.980]   and the COVID pass, and I want nothing to do with it.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.740]   But I'm, honestly, I'm more easily,
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.860]   I'm more willing to put up with some of the stuff
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.100]   that she is, but I convinced her, I was like,
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.380]   well, let's do it, it'll be fine.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.480]   It's not gonna be so bad.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.620]   Let me tell you, it's bad.
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.800]   It is absolutely horrendous here.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.040]   Just like in many places, it is awful.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.180]   In order for you to go almost anywhere,
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.500]   you have to have an app on your phone with a QR code
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.260]   that is scanned at the entrance to everything.
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.500]   And I, again, I knew that coming in,
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.660]   but I thought, you know what, come on, the French, right?
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.060]   They've got this proud history of standing up
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.580]   for liberté, fraternité, égalité, right?
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.460]   This is their national motto is liberté.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.700]   The French are known as people who loved,
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.700]   like, come on, they're not really gonna go into this.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.780]   And I'm not gonna go to Paris.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.700]   I'm not gonna go to a metropolitan area.
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.620]   I'm gonna stay out in the country, go to a little village.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.300]   It's not gonna be so bad, right?
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.640]   Yeah, it's bad.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.740]   I refuse to participate in any kind of government app
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.580]   on my personal tracking device.
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.400]   It's just, that's horrific.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.520]   If you know the slightest thing about data security
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.220]   and whatnot, that's a horrific thing.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.080]   So I refuse to participate on a matter of principle.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.160]   And what that means is I can't go anywhere.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.580]   I can't do anything.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.020]   I can't go to the mall.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.060]   You got people at the borders of all the malls.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.400]   I can't go to the stores.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.740]   Many of the stores, even ordinary stores are closed off.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.640]   Thankfully, not a grocery store.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.700]   Thankfully, not a grocery store.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.340]   I can still go to a grocery store and buy food.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.260]   I can still go to an open-air market
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.500]   and get some food there.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.980]   I can't go to any restaurants.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.260]   Get turned away again after again after again.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.660]   I can't even, in many cases, even buy a coffee
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.200]   because of not having the pass, not having the QR code.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.720]   And it's brutal.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.900]   It's brutal.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.180]   And I thought, oh, maybe the French were gonna protest more.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.740]   There was these pictures online you could see
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.260]   a few weeks ago of, oh, look, all the French
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.900]   are bringing their meals and they're picnicking
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.340]   on the street in front of the restaurants
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.660]   to protest the health pass.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.820]   Well, I can't see any evidence where I am
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.400]   of those actual protests.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.660]   And so it's pretty awful, right?
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.900]   So I'm done, I'm leaving.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.700]   But the point is that I have the choice to leave.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.140]   Why?
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.920]   Well, because I'm not poor.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.800]   I have the ability to just get up and go and to leave.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.980]   And I don't take that for granted.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.380]   That's something that has required
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.340]   a significant amount of work to build.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.220]   But when you see it, you recognize,
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.780]   man, I really wish that something I could say
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.580]   or something I could do could improve things
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.820]   'cause my heart goes out to people
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.620]   who can't just get up and leave,
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.940]   who have to live with this kind of stuff on a daily basis.
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.440]   It's all around the world, right?
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.180]   There's people who are locked in their houses
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.540]   and they're not allowed to come out of their house.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.060]   They're not allowed to come out of their house.
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.220]   There are right now in the West,
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.900]   there are government agents who will not allow you
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.500]   to buy more than two packs of beer
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.740]   because they think you're drinking too much.
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.260]   They won't allow you to leave your house to go get it.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.580]   You have to have it ordered in.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.540]   And there's government agents restricting the flow
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.540]   of alcohol to your private neighborhood.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.580]   It's insane.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.980]   And to me, it's been somewhat shocking
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.580]   because a year and a half ago,
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.140]   I was sitting watching the news,
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.820]   following it very closely, a lot of the news from China.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.120]   And I was watching a lot of the,
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.100]   some of the local language stuff that I could find as well.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.360]   And I'm seeing all these pictures
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.740]   of the Chinese citizens lining up.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.880]   And in order to ride on the public transportation,
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.260]   they had to pull out their app
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260]   and they had to show their green check mark
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.300]   with the Bluetooth geolocation showing,
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.620]   look, yes, we're good, we don't have COVID.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.220]   We can pass onto the train, et cetera.
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.300]   And I'm laughing, I'm like, that's awful.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.660]   But man, I'm glad that I'm not living in China.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:42.380]   And yet, here I am seeing that and worse in so many parts
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.700]   of places that I thought had more defenses against it.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:50.260]   It's stunning.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.620]   And of course, American President Joe Biden last night
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:59.260]   comes out with a new policy indicating that
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.420]   not only do you have various medical mandates
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.600]   for government entities,
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.660]   and not only have many large companies chosen that,
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.780]   but now the federal government
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.860]   is going to impose medical mandates
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.940]   for certain forms of medical treatment or testing
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.860]   for all companies larger than 100.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.620]   And I keep thinking to myself, oh, come on,
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.500]   the Americans, they're more rebellious.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.900]   They're not gonna go along with that.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.620]   This point, I don't know, I don't know.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.300]   I've always felt that probably the Americans
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.500]   are more rebellious and not actually gonna go along
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.740]   with that, but watching what they have gone along with
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.820]   is pretty stunning to me.
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.660]   So what's the point?
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.260]   The point is that when you tackle these problems,
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.200]   what you find is that if you are rich,
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.920]   the solutions are relatively easy.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.420]   If you don't wanna be ruled by someone else, you just leave.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.700]   And the rich always have a way out.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.260]   I can leave France.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.900]   It's not hard for me.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.060]   Go to the airport, get on an airplane and go.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.660]   And the world is full of countries that are far freer.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.020]   And I can just pick one of those countries.
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.460]   I can show up, grab a house, be totally at ease.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.460]   Everything is good.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.820]   That's 'cause I'm not broke.
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:30.980]   I think about the man or the woman who has a job
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.380]   and their employers can come along and say,
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.820]   we're going to mandate that you do something.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.940]   The person doesn't wanna do it.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.140]   What choice do you make?
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.000]   You need a job to feed your family, you roll over.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.740]   I appreciate that a lot of people think they wouldn't.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.900]   I'd like to think that I wouldn't,
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.660]   but at the end of the day, you gotta feed your family.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.140]   You gotta feed yourself.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.380]   And so if you're not rich,
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.820]   that's a really hard decision to make.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.220]   But if you do have a little bit of money,
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.820]   you gotta have some savings, you got some backup plans,
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.040]   that decision is a lot easier.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.180]   So the point is that money solves
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.360]   virtually all of these problems.
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.260]   School's not how you want it to be for your children.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.780]   Money means you pull them out, you hire a private tutor.
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.340]   Money means that you take them somewhere else.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.340]   A city or a country is not providing you
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.020]   with an appropriate level of freedom.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.340]   Money means that you just get up and go.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.300]   Imagine this, imagine your country
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.340]   tells you where you can and cannot go.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.960]   Imagine your country says,
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.240]   you can't fly into a certain country,
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.240]   you can't visit a certain country 'cause we don't like them.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:51.500]   Imagine that your country says,
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.860]   you can't leave our country.
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.380]   Even though you're a citizen,
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.220]   theoretically, we say we're a free country,
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.660]   you can't leave our country.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.660]   It's happening right now,
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.900]   without a good enough excuse that we approve.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.900]   Well, what does a rich man do?
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.500]   He just invents the excuse and goes.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.220]   Poor man though, doesn't have the pool to make the excuse.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.300]   And here's what's so nasty about this truth.
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.860]   You feel dirty talking about it,
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.100]   you feel dirty acknowledging it.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.420]   There's no question that rich people
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:29.020]   have tremendous amounts of personal privilege,
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.020]   privilege that many people don't have.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.140]   There's no question about that.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.140]   And you feel dirty because you want desperately
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.180]   for that not to be true.
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.720]   But it is true.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.260]   And on every single issue, it's true.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.900]   Maybe it's not travel freedom,
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.360]   maybe it's banking freedom.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.260]   Well, rich people have options all around the world.
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.580]   They can afford to come and go
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.460]   and go where they wanna do
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.820]   and spend their money how they want to.
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.420]   Maybe it's getting access to certain things.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.460]   Rich people can always get access to certain things.
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.740]   No matter what it is.
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.440]   Maybe you're saying, oh, I should have the freedom
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.300]   to protect myself and my family.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.780]   Yeah, well, if you're rich, you do, right?
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.580]   Because the politicians always have the goons with the guns
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.740]   around them no matter what,
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:10.740]   no matter what laws they do.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.780]   But if you're not rich, well, tough luck.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.620]   Sucks to be you.
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:18.060]   So if you genuinely desire to be free,
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.180]   you genuinely care about freedom,
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.780]   you have to prioritize wealth building
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.820]   as part of that freedom plan.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.260]   Now, there are tiers to this.
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.020]   It's not, you don't have to become worth $100 million
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.100]   before you can live freely.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:33.940]   There are tiers to it.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.260]   Go back and listen to my seven rings of freedom series.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.220]   Many of those rings of freedom are extremely practical.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.140]   Only one of them is total financial freedom.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.940]   But there is no question that financial freedom
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.940]   leads to everything else.
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.740]   And in today's world, you can buy it.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.100]   You can buy the freedom that you want.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.580]   Your country won't let you travel.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.520]   They won't let you go a certain place.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.620]   Go ahead and buy yourself a citizenship in another country
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.780]   that actually cares about freedom.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.340]   Gives you a passport and says, here you go.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.340]   We'll leave you alone.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.260]   It's just a simple value for value transaction.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.420]   You give them money, they give you travel documents.
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.300]   Boom, you're done.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.980]   You care about your freedom
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.780]   and you don't wanna submit to a certain thing,
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.180]   a certain medical mandate.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.700]   Okay, just go somewhere else where you don't have that.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:30.100]   Or simply pay somebody to give you the right paperwork.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.740]   Pay somebody to put your name in the system.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.860]   Pay somebody else to hold the QR code for you.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.740]   All of these things can be bought.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:42.500]   Don't like the laws restricting you
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.100]   from certain something that you want?
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.420]   Just go somewhere else.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.200]   That's the point.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.460]   I despise the fact that this is true.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:59.460]   I have spent a lot of my life wishing and battling
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.260]   with myself, ideologically, with others,
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.940]   trying to say that this is not true.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.060]   Shouldn't be true.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.020]   Shouldn't be true.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.500]   And I'm still willing to stand up
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.820]   and encourage and support others.
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.700]   But at the end of the day,
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.900]   if you want one of the fastest and most direct paths
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.900]   to personal freedom, it's often going to be found
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:30.100]   in financial freedom and wealth building.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.100]   And I say that because I hope that
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.540]   if you'll think about it,
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.900]   you'll consider whether this is actually true,
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.440]   may help you to possibly save some time in your life.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.980]   One of the things that,
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.380]   I've been doing this series of shows
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.140]   on my biggest financial mistakes.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.240]   One of the biggest financial mistakes that I ever made
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:58.060]   was getting involved in ideological and political battles.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.860]   I used to think, oh, this is not right.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.820]   It shouldn't be this way.
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:02.860]   The world should be different.
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.820]   And I'm gonna get involved.
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.820]   I'm gonna vote.
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.660]   I'm gonna campaign.
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.940]   I'm gonna spend time writing long Facebook posts
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.340]   and advocating for my political solution.
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.220]   All of that stuff is just a total waste of time.
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.060]   Total waste of time.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.020]   Unless you can figure out how to make a living on it,
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:18.940]   and you can figure out and say,
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.980]   hey, this is what I really wanna do,
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.940]   and I wanna become some kind of political pundit.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.060]   Okay, fine.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.460]   But for the average person, it's just a total waste of time.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.740]   And if somebody had been able to persuade me,
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.860]   hey, Joshua, listen, you want freedom.
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.180]   You're never gonna find it in this way.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.980]   You're not gonna find it by advocating for libertarianism
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.780]   or whatever you think it is.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.020]   You're not gonna find it in that way.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.720]   And I think it's useful to have a personal philosophy
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.560]   that makes sense.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.400]   But if somebody just said,
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.940]   Joshua, if you want freedom, get rich.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.380]   If I believed them,
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:56.060]   probably would've enjoyed a lot more freedom a lot earlier.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.580]   And I see a lot of people who are making the same choice
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.940]   that I made, say, no, we're gonna fight for this.
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.860]   There's no point.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.100]   There's no point.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.460]   If you wanna be free,
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.200]   if you wanna be able to go where you wanna go,
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.620]   live how you wanna live,
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.060]   walk your way up the steps of wealth,
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.780]   you don't have to be a multimillionaire.
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.060]   First thing is save some money.
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.020]   All right, go through my Rings of Freedom series again.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.300]   Start by saving some money.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.180]   Build your own business.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.300]   Withdraw your children from government schools.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.700]   Get your family able to move around as one
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.620]   rather than being pulled in multiple competing directions.
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.940]   Build some assets.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.380]   Build some multi-country,
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.420]   multi-continental options and solutions.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.420]   Build some redundancy in your life.
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.380]   And get rich.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.540]   If you do that, you'll have far more personal freedom.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.460]   And then what I see about this is
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.660]   there's no reason in today's world
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.240]   why anybody can't do that.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.860]   There's no reason.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.380]   You're not stuck where you are.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.540]   You don't have to take it.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.820]   You can change it.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.660]   But you gotta be practical and realistic.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.060]   Don't spend your time wasting your time
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.540]   arguing for politics or getting involved in advocacy
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.060]   for something or fighting it out in the courts.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.660]   Let people who are rich do that.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.220]   You just go and get rich
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.060]   and then enjoy your personal freedom
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.900]   and then teach other people how to get rich.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.740]   They'll enjoy their personal freedom.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:33.860]   I understand how
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:38.100]   revolting
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.420]   this can sound.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.260]   Really do.
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.180]   It sucks.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:51.380]   But sometimes in life you have to face the ugly truth
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.780]   and then acknowledge it and say,
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.140]   hey, if this is true, I'm just gonna move forward.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.820]   Doesn't matter whether you think
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.940]   something should be true or not.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:05.140]   If something is true, there's no good to fight against it.
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.980]   So ask yourself, is it true?
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.860]   Will you enjoy high levels of personal freedom,
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.300]   higher levels of personal freedom if you are richer?
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.340]   And then is there a more efficient path
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.540]   to your achieving those higher levels of personal freedom
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.900]   than by becoming richer?
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.940]   I think in at least 80% of the cases,
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.180]   the answer is the fastest path to personal freedom
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.940]   is found in higher levels of personal productivity,
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.540]   becoming a more useful and valuable contributor to society,
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.500]   a better worker, a more skilled worker
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.300]   which leads in the fullness of time
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.900]   to higher levels of wage and income,
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.940]   high levels of wage and income
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.500]   lead to more personal financial stability.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.100]   Take some of that money, set it aside,
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.500]   you become more and more invulnerable
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.580]   to the daily vicissitudes of life.
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.740]   As those numbers keep growing, your options get bigger.
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:13.300]   Maybe there is a point in time
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.420]   at which you have enough money
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.820]   that you don't need anymore in terms of freedom.
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.980]   I think it probably does exist.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.260]   I don't know what that number is.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.260]   What I do know is that when I look at my personal freedom,
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:29.860]   I enjoy massive levels of personal freedom,
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.940]   but the levels of personal freedom that I don't yet enjoy
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.340]   are due to my not yet having enough money.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.180]   And the fastest and most direct path to that freedom
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.060]   is not to fight for it, but to make more money.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:47.020]   Hats off to people who are gonna fight for it,
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.620]   hats off to those who are gonna argue and debate, et cetera.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.300]   But I think that if you want fast results,
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.420]   you care about your personal freedom,
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.540]   freedom of yourself, freedom of your family,
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.500]   freedom of conscience,
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.340]   getting richer should be at the top of the list
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.980]   for how to achieve that.
