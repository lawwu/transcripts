[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   We apologize for the poor quality of the following historic recording of a sermon by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   given at the inauguration of the London Theological Seminary.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   This has been caused by deterioration in the original master tape
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   and a knocking noise caused by, we believe, a wobbly lectern.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   But we hope this doesn't spoil your enjoyment of this message by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I need scarcely say that I regard it as a very great privilege
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   to be asked to take part in this service and to preach on this occasion.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   We all must have been delighted to hear the report given by the Reverend Andrew Davies
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   on behalf of the faculty and the remarks of our chairman, Mr. Mingard.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And we thank God for his good hand upon this seminary.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And we are indeed truly grateful to Mr. Kinsett and his fellow trustees
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   for enabling us to carry on this work in these excellent premises.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Well, now, I'd like to call your attention tonight to the eighth verse
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   in that thirteenth chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, most of which we have read together.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever."
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Let me read verse seven as well.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   "Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation, or of their testimony, or of their life.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and today, and forever."
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Now, these words were written, as I'm sure all of you recall, to these Hebrew Christians
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   who were in a somewhat discouraged and unhappy condition.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   There were many reasons for that.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   They were being subjected to persecution.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   They were much misunderstood.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And the whole circumstances facing them were utterly discouraging.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   The faith had not long come into being.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   The Church was very young at this particular point.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And here they were, subjected to these various factors which tended to produce this sense of discouragement
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   and in some of them, even hopelessness.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And these words are addressed to them.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   The author is encouraging them here in this last chapter.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Indeed, he's been doing that right the way through.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   But here he seems to sum it up in this one great and resounding statement.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And I call attention to it tonight because we again, in our day and generation, are in very similar circumstances.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   All of us who are Christians and who are members of churches are facing extremely difficult times.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   But I'm particularly concerned about the men who are here as students in this seminary.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   There are many people in the world, doubtless, and I'm afraid that there are some even in the Church,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   who would regard them as almost being madmen, that they should forsake some of them profitable callings,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   callings in which they had bright promises, that they should forsake all that and enter into training
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   in order to be fitted eventually to be ministers of churches and preachers of the Gospel.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   For to all outward appearances, the conditions could scarcely be much worse.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   There are days of real discouragement to the churches speaking generally
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   and to all who have the privilege of being in the ministry of the Word of God.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So I bear them in mind in a very special manner, though what I'm going to say is of course true,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   as I've said, of every Christian and of every church member.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Now what interests me, and this is what I want to direct your attention to,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   is the way in which this man gives them the comfort and the consolation and the encouragement.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   He might have just said, "Jesus Christ," and that that is enough and all sufficient.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   But I'm interested in the way in which he puts it. He says, "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today and forever."
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   He takes the trouble to state this truth concerning our Lord to them in an historical context.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   He looks back, he looks at the present, he looks to the future.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And I think that that's a very profitable thing for us to do.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   After all, the church is set in history, and we are a part of history.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And it's a particularly encouraging thing to do, to think of the Christian church
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   and everything connected with her in the grand context of history.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And I want to try to show you that if we do that, we shall find, as this man intended these people to find,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   every ground for encouragement, every reason for going forward undaunted and without any apology whatsoever
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   with this great and glorious work.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   So I would suggest that we look at it like this.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Let's start by glancing at the changing scenes of time.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Yesterday, today, forever, the future.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And I want to deal with that in a rather restricted manner.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   And I do so simply because I think it will bring out the force of the message that we have here still more strongly.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I'm not going to review the whole of the past history of the Christian church over 19 centuries.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I'm rather going to look at yesterday in terms of a hundred years ago.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I do this for several reasons.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I have said many times during my ministry that I'm very glad that I'm a preacher of the gospel in the 20th century
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   and not in the 19th century.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And that has always caused considerable surprise and amazement to people.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   But I believe that, and I say that very honestly and very truthfully.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So I'm calling your attention to yesterday in terms of what the position was a hundred years ago.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Other reasons I've had for doing this is this, that I've been several times comparatively recently
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   preaching in anniversary occasions, centenary occasions.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I may say that I haven't preached this sermon, but these other occasions have made me think very much in terms of a hundred years ago.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Now let's do that.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   If you look at a hundred years ago, you will find as you look at it superficially, a situation in the church very different indeed from the present one.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   It was an age when religion was popular.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Everybody went to church or chapel.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   There are many stories to illustrate this.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   If a young man came up to London looking for a post or some work in a factory or in a shop or anything like that,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   one of the first questions he probably would have been asked was which denomination he belonged to.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   And his success or failure in obtaining the post often depended upon that.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   If he happened to be having an interview with a Baptist manager or owner of a firm and turned out not to be a Baptist,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   well, his chances ended at that point.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And so on with most of the other denominations.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   That was the position, as you know.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   The churches were full.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I had occasion to say a number of years back, Westminster Chapel had to be rebuilt in 1865.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Why?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Well, because the building then in existence was too small.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Well, how many did that seat?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   1,500.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   But a building seating 1,500 was too small in the 1860s.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Spurgeon had built his enormous tabernacle, you remember, seating some 5,000 or more.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And there were many other similar buildings.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Well, that was the state of affairs.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Everything was flourishing.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Religion seemed to be popular.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And people went in crowds to listen to the preaching of the gospel.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And as for the world in which the church was operating, it was a world of peace, a Pax Britannica.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   There had been no real major war since the Napoleonic Wars.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   The Crimean War was but an incident.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   This great Pax Britannica, the country was developing, was flourishing.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   The prospect seemed very bright indeed.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Now, that was the position then looked at superficially.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   But, and this is what I want really to put before you tonight.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   If you really got beneath the surface and examined the position as it really was,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   you would find that it was not quite as good as it appeared to be.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I'm now giving you my reasons for preferring to preach at the present time rather than a hundred years ago.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   What did you find beneath the surface?
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Well, you found an element of smugness and of respectability.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   These crowded churches, when you really came to analyze them,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   you would have found that the people who went did so far too often as a matter of habit and of custom.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It was the polite, it was the nice, it was the respectable thing to do.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Not only that, they were undoubtedly living on the past.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   There had been a great revival in the 18th century,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   which had really shaken this country and changed the face of the country.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And there had been minor revivals that had continued from that.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   And undoubtedly, the apparent prosperity of the Victorian era church was a legacy,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   was the result of something that had happened before.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   But these people were now living on the past, on the capital as it were, that had been accumulated.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   I don't hesitate to assert that they were more religious than Christian.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   They had very little by way of a living experience.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   There were some, of course, who had. There were many who had.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   But I think that speaking generally, we can say that that apparent successful Victorian church
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   was more or less a sham in that the living principle had more or less disappeared.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   But in addition to that, and this is very germane to what we have under consideration tonight,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   there were forces at work which were ultimately striking at the very roots of the Christian faith.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   I want to mention some of them because I think it's important that we should.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   It's difficult for us to cast our minds back, but the position was something like this.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   The age of science had come in and of the scientific outlook.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Now this was part of the result, of course, of the work of Charles Darwin,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   his book The Origin of Species, published in 1859.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   But that was only one of a number of other movements in the same direction.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   There had been phenomenal advances in the realm of science during the whole of the 19th century.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And the scientific outlook had come in and was governing the thinking of thoughtful people,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   the leaders of thought.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   It hadn't come through to the masses who were still attending their places of worship.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   But amongst others, it had certainly entered in and it was taking many, many forms.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   There was this whole notion of progress and of development.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   This was not only true in the work of men like Charles Darwin.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   The philosophers took the same view.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   What we now call sociology was coming in.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   A French philosopher and sociologist, Comte, had taught and it had become very popular
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   that there had been three main stages in the development of the human race.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   A kind of theological, superstitious, artificial condition.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Then that was replaced by philosophy and thought and reason, what they call metaphysics.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   But now, he said, that was going and we were coming to the true age, the age of science,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   something positive, positivism.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And this was a creed that was adopted by large numbers of people.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   You see, everything seemed to be working in the same direction.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   New knowledge was coming, travel was being made possible,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   new ways of working had come in.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And then, with this idea of Darwin from the more biological point of view,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   everything seemed to be indicating a development and an advance and a progress
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   at the same time popular education had come in in 1870.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   So that there was this new way of thinking.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   At the same time, what is called psychology was beginning to come in.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And man and his experiences and his feelings, these were all being subjected to analysis.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And the suggestion was that what had been claimed in terms of religion
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   could be very easily explained and explained away in terms of psychology.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   But then, and still more important from the point of view of a preacher,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   an entirely new approach to the Bible had come in.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   It had started in a very small way in the previous century,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   but it was rarely in the 1830s that the so-called higher criticism of the Bible
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   had begun to make an impact, starting of course in Germany,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   but had come over to this country and was beginning to affect men's people,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   people's view even of the Bible itself.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Now this was something quite new.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   This had been regarded, generally speaking, as the word of God,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   and was to be taken as such, but now it was suggested that it should be regarded as any other book.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   It should be approached from the standpoint of historical and literary criticism.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   That it was literature, like all other literature,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   and its statements were queried and questioned,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   and where they didn't seem to tally with this new scientific outlook and the supposed scientific facts.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Well then, you rejected the teaching of the Bible and you accepted the scientific teaching.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   At the same time, there was a new interest in man,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   and in the development of man, what is called anthropology.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   People began to explore other parts of the world,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   and they discovered other kinds of civilizations, some of them very primitive.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   And on the basis of this, a new interest developed in what was called the history of religion,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   or comparative religion.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And they were quite confident that here again they could find this same process of development
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   from something very primitive to something more advanced,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   as they found in all these other realms and departments of life and of thought.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Well, I don't want to worry you with all this, but I think it's important we should remember this.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   While there appeared to be great prosperity and churches were full and packed,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   and the great pulpitiers, the so-called great preachers, were popular and so on,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   there was a kind of canker eating at the root and at the vitals of it all.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And the more advanced thinkers,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   and they were to be found in the universities and elsewhere,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   their view was really that there was no God,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   no supernatural, no miraculous,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   no infallible Bible,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   no revelation.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ was only a man.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   The great idea was what was known as the quest for the historical Jesus,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   the Jesus of history, having said that there can be no such thing as the supernatural or the miraculous,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   that everything is natural, everything belongs to nature, everything can be explained in these terms.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   So, starting with that, clearly, Jesus of Nazareth was only a man.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And all this claim that he was the eternal son of God and that he'd work miracles
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   and that there was a supernatural element, this was all but a part of that primitive folklore,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   the fancy and the ignorance of primitive people.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   So there was no such thing as salvation by grace and a new birth.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   No man had to provide his own salvation, and he was capable of doing it.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   He'd got reason, he'd got understanding, he could think logically,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   and all he needed was to be trained and to be educated.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   And they believed that as a result of this,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   they were entitled to look forward with great optimism to a glorious future.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   They looked forward to the coming of the 20th century,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   when all the results of this amazing offense would be reaped,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   and increasingly from decade to decade.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Now that was, speaking generally, the outlook of a hundred years ago.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   It was an age of idealism, an age which believed profoundly in man and his action.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Politics was felt to be the key to it all.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   You could abolish slums and poverty and all the things that called crime
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   and things of that description, and you really could bring in the new Jerusalem
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   into England's green and pleasant land.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   They really believed it.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And so, you looked at it on the surface,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   the prospect for religion seemed to be marvelous, wonderful.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   But beneath the surface, taking a deeper view,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   the situation was one for real alone.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   There were very few who could see this.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Unfortunately, the vast majority of preachers and clergy,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   ministers of free churches and of the established church,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   they couldn't see this.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   They were prepared to accept these new ideas, this new thinking,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   often at the expense of their belief in the scriptures.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Many were prepared to compromise.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   There were very few who stood against this.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   To his eternal credit, there stood out Charles Adams Spurgeon
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   and his downgrade movement.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   He saw and he realized what was happening, and he said so.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   And he became very unpopular.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   He was even betrayed by men who had been trained for nothing, many of them,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   in the college that he himself had founded, his pastor's college.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Nevertheless, in spite of vilification and persecution,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Spurgeon stated openly and fearlessly what he had come to see so clearly,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   and that was the downgrade movement.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   But there were others who could also see that there was a great change
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   beneath the surface, a man like Matthew Arnold,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   who I don't think can be regarded as a Christian at all.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   But he was troubled about this because he believed in religion.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   He didn't believe in the Christian faith.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   He accepted all this criticism, this idea that I've been describing to you.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   But he could see that there was a great change taking place,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   and he expressed it in these moving words.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   "The sea of faith was once too at the full,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   and round earth's shore lay like the folds of a bright girtle fold.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   But now I only hear its melancholy long withdrawing roar,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   retreating to the breath of the night wind down the vast edges drear
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   and naked shingles of the world."
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   He could hear nothing now but this melancholy long withdrawing roar.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   The tide was going out. Religion was ceasing to be.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   He, like his father, as I say, they believed in religion.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   It was their own religion and of their own making.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   But they believed that religion was of value in a social and in a general sense.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   So it troubled him.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   But there it is. He could see that this was actually taking place,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   and he was troubled by that fact.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Very well. There is a hundred years ago. That's yesterday.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   What about today?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Well, superficially, as I said at the beginning, and there's no need for me to say it,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   we're all well aware of it.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   We seem to be in an entirely different situation.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   We don't have to build still larger churches.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   The phenomenon of which we are painfully familiar is empty churches,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   churches derelict, churches being sold, turned into warehouses,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   and various other things, churches, church buildings in a state of ruin.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Looked at superficially, the situation today seems to be completely hopeless.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   So much so, as I say, that many would say, "Well, what can have possessed these young men
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   at a time such as this when obviously everything is coming to an end,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   when people are talking about a post-Christian era and a religion-less Christianity?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   What can have possessed them to make them consider becoming ministers of churches
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   and preachers of the gospel?"
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   But again, you see, it is an utter mistake to regard things only on the surface.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   I now want to substantiate my statement that I'm happier to be a preacher today
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   than a hundred years ago, that I believe one is in a better position than a hundred years ago.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Why do I say that?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Well, I say so because looking at the situation today in a deeper manner,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   we have a great deal to encourage us, much more so than they had a hundred years ago.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   What am I talking about?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Well, start, if you like, with the state of the world itself.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Compare the world of a hundred years ago with the world of tonight.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   No longer Pax Britannica, no longer the developing empire,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   no longer business and everything flourishing.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Now, now, we've had two world wars.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   The golden century of the optimists and the idealists of a hundred years ago
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   has turned out to be the century of two world wars,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Buchenwald, concentration camps, horrors such as the hydrogen and the atomic bomb.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   That's the position. When you look beneath the surface, it's an age of fear, an age of uncertainty,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   fear of a third world war, fear of a possibility of a world famine,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   the problem of ecology, pollution, the possibility of doomsday.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   This is the world in which we are actually living.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   So you see, we are surrounded by a world which is in a very different state from the world of a hundred years ago.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   And this is why I say we are in a happier and a better position,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   that that false optimism and assurance of progress and of development
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   and the coming of the new Jerusalem, it's been completely falsified, completely so.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   I imagine that had one been preaching a hundred years ago,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   it would have been very difficult to persuade people that all this appearance was false.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   There's no difficulty today.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   I always say today that the modern world provides us with a perfect introduction to the gospel.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   There's no need to argue about it.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   The state of the world is introducing the gospel for us.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Now this is not only true of society, but act like that in general.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Take the proud boasts that were made in the name of science and of philosophy.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   The certainty they had, the assurance that they had.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   They didn't say that they were just putting forward theories, facts, no trouble at all.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   But you know, all that's gone.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   We are in the age of probability and of relativity, possibility.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   A book has recently been published on the theme of the end of science.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And its theme, you see, is this, that all the major advances in science have already been made.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   And that all that will happen in the future is that a certain number of details will be fitted in.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Man has already arrived on the moon.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   He's penetrated as far as he's ever likely to do.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Nobody talks about the men in Mars any longer.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   They were quite sure there were people there.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   They're now equally certain that there's nobody there and that there is no life there at all.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Science has reached as far as she can.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   This is what scientists are saying.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   I'm not quoting a Christian.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   I'm quoting a non-Christian who's a scientist.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   The real leaders in the realm of science believe that we have exhausted the possibilities.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   We've come to the end.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And not only that, we're all aware of the fact that we are living in an age of irrationalism.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   You see, a hundred years ago they believed in reason.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   All you had to do was to think and you couldn't go wrong.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   And if men did think, well, you'd have this perfect world.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   There's a revolt against that.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Take all this drug addiction.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   People don't always remember, you know, that that started in one of the greatest universities in this world
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   and was led by a professor called Professor Timothy Leary.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   And this is what he said.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   He said, "We've been living too much in the realm of reason and the mind of understanding.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   We must go back to something more elemental.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   We need sensation.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   We need experience.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   How are we to get it?
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Well, one of the ways is to take drugs.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   And then you'll have these marvelous experiences.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   And there are people, intelligent people, able people, well-trained people,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   who are suggesting we should all go back, as it were, to the land
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   and back to a primitive kind of existence.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   So, you see, we are witnessing the reverse of everything in which they bursted a hundred years ago.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Now, my argument is this.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   All this is the introduction to the preaching of the gospel.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   It would have been very difficult to persuade people of this a hundred years ago.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   They could point out to you how week after week there was some new, fresh discovery,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   everything was evolving and developing.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   No real thinker says anything like that at the present time.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   It is not true.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   We are living in a world of utter disillusionment.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And when you come, as I did looking at a hundred years ago, to the realm of the Bible,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   there's been an amazing change.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Then, you see, they talked about the assured results of criticism.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   They were quite sure that the books of the Bible were written, the Gospels included,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   towards the end of the first century and probably several of them in the second century.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   And they were sure of this. Why?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Well, because they'd made a scientific investigation.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   It was scientific criticism.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   It wasn't thought, it wasn't fancy.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   They had applied the rules of science to the Bible,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   and they were able to prove, as they said, the assured results of criticism,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   that these books were not books of history.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   They were theological books.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   They were the kind of thinking of the church.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   They'd invented so many of these stories to fit in with their teaching and with their theories.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And they taught this with great assurance.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   But there has been, as I say, a very great change.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   One of the most interesting things that's happened for quite a long time
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   is that the famous, not to say the notorious, Dr. John Robinson,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   one-time Bishop of Woolwich, who created such a stir back about 1963 with his book "Honest to God."
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   This man is an expert on this particular line of dating of the documents and so on.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And he has comparatively recently published two books.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   The first is called "The Redating of the New Testament," which he published in 1976.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And the second one was "Can We Trust the New Testament?" in 1977.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Now, Dr. Robinson has not changed his point of view.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   He hasn't changed his theology.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   But from the strictly technical standpoint, he now assures us, as far as his work is concerned,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   that all our New Testament documents were written before A.D. 70.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   John Robinson, a blank contradiction of what was regarded as the assured results of criticism
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   a hundred years ago and until comparatively recently.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Indeed, there was a very amusing incident. A fellow professor of his had given expression to that old point of view.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And Dr. Robinson took him to task. I'm going to read his words to you.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   He says that this other professor, as a doctrinal theologian,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   he should show himself more aware of what is going on over the fence in the field of New Testament scholarship.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   This man, you see, subscribed to the old view, which was so popular,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   that the Gospels according to Matthew, Mark, and Luke were more or less true historically.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   But as for John, well, this was just theology.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And scarcely any value at all from a strict historical standpoint.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   He says, "My colleague," he says, "my friend, the other professor,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   he should really have been aware of what is going on over the fence."
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   He's in the field of doctrinal theology.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   He said, "He should really have looked over the fence to see what's happening in my field of New Testament scholarship."
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And this is what he says.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   "The view that the synoptists," Matthew, Mark, and Luke,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   "The view that the synoptists give us that Jesus of history, John, the Christ of faith,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   is, as he must well know, fast on the way out."
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Mark is being recognized as far more theological than John, and John as far more historical.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   You see, it's the exact opposite of what was so confidently asserted a hundred years ago and indeed since then.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Here is this man now saying that it's almost the exact opposite.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   The gap between the fourth evangelist and the events he is purporting to describe
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   is narrowing both in space and time.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Indeed, I should now be prepared to say that he, John, stands as close to source historically and theologically as any of the others,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   if not closer, and represents the Alpha as well as the Omega of New Testament witness.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Now, that is why I say that in many respects, I'm almost prepared to say all respects,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   it is very much easier to be a preacher of the gospel today than it was a hundred years ago.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Then you have to face all this criticism.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   You see, it's come around full circle.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Back we are to very much the position before all this great endeavor began.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   At the same time, in the world of archaeology, discoveries have been made,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   and the vast majority of these are confirming the historicity of what you read in the Bible.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   I'll never forget, even back in the '30s, I read a book on the book of the prophet Daniel,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   which really was quite ebook-making at that particular point,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   because these critics have been saying with absolute assurance that there had never been such a king as King Belshazzar,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   of whom you read in Daniel.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   But you see, sheer work of archaeologists has demonstrated the fact that there was such a king.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And this is true in so many other respects.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   The fight goes on.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   But my assertion is that the Bible is being substantiated from year to year in a way that is truly amazing,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   and that the work and the power of a hundred years is rapidly disappearing before our eyes.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   On top of this, we know, some of us who are older, that that first world war shook that whole scientific idealistic out to its very foundations.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   The fact that a war came at all, but beyond that, that man rose in Switzerland, known as Dr. Karl Barth.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   He never became an evangelical Christian, but at any rate, he really did do a thorough work of demolition of that old confident liberalism
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   and progressivism and a belief in an inevitable progress.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   And it's been followed by many others.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   There are very few men today who preach that old social gospel and that idealistic conception of progress and of development.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   What he said was this, we must come back to the message of the Bible.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   He still can't shake off his higher criticism, but he says the message of the Bible.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   This is the thing that we need.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   So, we find ourselves in a position today in which the whole state of the world and of mankind, the condition of scholarship,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   are giving us an introduction to our gospel.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   It's been done for us, so that we need spend less and less of our time in demonstrating this.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Any man who ever believed the gospel, he knew that that was all wrong.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   But then, the facts appear to be on the other side. They were not.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   But by now, it is becoming evident, and all along the line, you have this great change.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   The changing scenes of time.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   The Victorian optimism and idealism, the apparent pessimism and hopelessness of today, but looked up beneath the surface.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   How interesting it is.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   I needn't look to the future, because I can say this without any hesitation,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   that the future is going to be precisely what the history of man has always been.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   The changes that take place are all on the surface.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Very well, my second point therefore is this one.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   The unchanging task of the church.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   This is the church's task, and it's an unchanging task.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   It was the same a hundred years ago, it was the same a thousand years ago, it's the same tonight.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   What is that?
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Well, the task confronting us is the state of the world and the state of man.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   These differences of which people make so much are entirely on the surface.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   A man's a man for all that, as Robert Burns puts it.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   A rank is but the guinea stamp.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   A man's a man for all that.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   And though clever men may put forward theories, and they may sound very plausible,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   and the church may be quaking and fearful, it comes to nothing.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   It's happened so often.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   There is nothing new under the sun.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   And the problem confronting the preacher of today is the same one that has confronted
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   every preacher that's ever existed for nearly 2,000 years.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   What's the problem?
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   It is man in sin.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   It doesn't matter whether he flies in an airplane or walks on his feet.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   He is still the same, and he's interested in the same things.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   I've been pointing this out for 50 years.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   It isn't the rate at which a man goes to sin that matters.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   It's the fact that he's going to sin.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   In primitive times, a man walked to sin.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   He can now fly in a jet airplane to sin.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   It isn't the speed at which he travels that matters.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   What's he going to do when he arrives?
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Drunkenness is still drunkenness.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Immorality is still immorality.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   There is no sin committed today, but you find it in the Bible somewhere.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   And all the sins described in the Bible are rampant today.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   Man does not change.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   He is still the same failure.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   He is still the same rebel against God.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   They take new forms.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   We've got new terms.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   They didn't speak of alcoholism 100 years ago, but it was there, exactly the same.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   And they took different kinds of drugs.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   The surface, the clothing changes.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   But man doesn't change at all.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   And this is the task of the church.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   This is the need that preachers have got to face.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   We mustn't be misled by appearances.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   That is the greatest fallacy of all.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   That is why it's such a wonderful thing that there is so much history in the Bible.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   It is a book of history.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   It's not a philosophy.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   It's not a teaching.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   And you get these histories and thank God for them,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   because they show us this, that man is a sinner and has been through the long story of civilization.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   And he's as great a sinner tonight as he's ever been.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   And not only that, we see the futility of every effort and endeavor to deal with that.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   I've been working rather hard recently, and I relaxed a bit these last two days
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   in listening to the reports of this conference, political conference that's going on.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   And you know it's pathetic.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   They still don't see it.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   I heard this afternoon that the main cause of crime is poverty and inadequate social conditions.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Now, the real experts in this are telling us that the real cause of crime is affluence.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   That these young people have got so much money in their pockets, they don't know what to do with it.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   They drink and then they smash up everything.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Affluence, not poverty, and so on.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   So the problem remains exactly the same.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   The only difference that I can see is this, that a hundred years ago, as I say,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   they were trusting to reason and to understanding.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   But that seems to be going.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   And now what people want is experience, something to satisfy their feelings, their sensations.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   And this does constitute only a new aspect of the problem.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   Because we are living in a world when people are more or less prepared to believe in anything
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   that offers them any hope.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   The cults are popular.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Transcendental meditation, popular.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Anything that's going to relax the tension and give people ease and enable them to sleep at night
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   without taking drugs or to function the next day without taking stimulants.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   This is what we are facing.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   The old optimism has gone.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Our world is uncertain. It's collapsing round and about us.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   What can we do? And they're ready to believe anything.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Protestants are ready to go back to Rome.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   Anything that appears to give any kind of confidence and assurance, they'll cling to any authority,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   anything that claims to be authoritative.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   And so, though the fundamental problem is precisely the same,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   the peculiar task of the preacher today is to expose the vanity and the ultimate futility
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   of all that is being suggested by way of remedies at this present time.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Our business is to face the exact situation as it is
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   and realize that even the form has got to be dealt with
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   in order that we can show that ultimately there is only one thing that matters.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   And the one thing that matters is my third point, and it's simply this.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   The changing scenes of time, the unchanging task of the church,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   and the changeless Christ, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   This is the one thing of which we can be absolutely certain.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   You can't be certain of anything else in a world like this.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   The assured results have had to be thrown overboard.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Nothing is certain. Probability, relativity, possibility.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   That's the prevailing view over and against this.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   It is going to be the privilege of my friends who have now joined this college
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   and of all of us who preach to confront this world that has lost its balance,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   lost its foundations, is in a state of utter bewilderment and uncertainty,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   and to say there's only one certainty. What's that?
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Why is he the same? On what grounds can we say that he is the same?
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Well, we can do so on many grounds. I'm only going to give you some headings.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   We can do so on the grounds of his person. Who is he?
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   Now, this is the great thing.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   If we are not certain as to who he is and what his person is,
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   we have no message. We have no gospel.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   You see, the world has been following men.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   It's followed its different philosophers with great eagerness and with great thoroughness,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   and they've all failed us.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   We stand before them and we say there is only one who is deserving of your utter and complete loyalty.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   There's only one to whom you should bow, to whom you should submit yourself as an absolute authority.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Jesus Christ. Why?
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Well, this has been the great theme of this man in this epistle.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   God, he says, who at some great times and in diverse manner has made him time-past
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   unto the people through the prophets.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   And in these last days spoken unto us in his son.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   This is the unique event of which we've got to tell people.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   This is what they don't realize, that something happened.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   1978 years ago, which is absolutely unique,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   one came into this world from eternity, from God.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   He was truly man, yes, but not only that.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   He is the eternal son of God. Listen.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   He being the brightness of God's glory and the express image of his person.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   And he goes on showing the uniqueness of this person and his superiority to all others.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   He says angels are very great and they're mighty in power,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   but they don't stand any comparison with this person.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Thou, Lord, in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   are the work of thy hands.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   They shall perish, but thou remainest.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   They all shall wax old as doth a garment, the heavens and the earth.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   But he remains as a vesture, shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   But thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   The angels in their brightness and glory are but his servants, his instruments.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   He uses them, he commands them. He's above them all.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Greater than Moses, greater than Aaron,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   greater than anybody who's ever been in the world wide.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   He's son of God, the incarnation.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Now this is what we are to tell people in this uncertain world.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   This is the one thing of which we can be certain.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   And that he is changeless, that's the point he's making.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Why? Well, because he is who he is.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   God is the father of lights with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   The same is true of the Son.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   He's co-equal, he's co-eternal with his father.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   As Paul says, he cannot deny himself. It's impossible.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   One of the glories of the Godhead is that it cannot change.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   It's an amazing thing this. God cannot change. God cannot lie.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   God as it were is heaven-bent by his own glory.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   And what applies to the father, applies to the son, and applies to the Holy Spirit also.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   Here is one who cannot change. It is impossible that he could.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   This is what this man is giving to these people, as comfort and consolation and encouragement.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   And then of course he goes on to say that this one is the Savior.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   You are in troubles as this man. We are in trouble.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   The world is always in trouble. It can't deal with its troubles and its problems.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   But there is one who can. This is our message.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   It's God's will, God made it, not men.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   And it's in trouble and it can't get out of it. God is concerned about it.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   This is the whole message. God is still concerned.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   And he has acted in the only way that can succeed.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   So this Jesus of Nazareth, Son of God, is the Savior.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   He is the one who is going to give us deliverance.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   But let me emphasize this, because this man has been doing so right through his great epistle.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior, and we must assert equally that he is the only Savior.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   There is no other. He needs no help. He needs no assistance. He needs no supplement.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   There are those who would have us believe that we must also believe in the Virgin Mary,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   that she's a co-redemptrix.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   Now as I say, there is this extraordinary loose tendency on the part of people who are Protestants in name,
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   to look back to Rome with longing eyes, or to say it doesn't matter what they teach
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   as long as they have an experience such as we have.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   But it does matter, my friends. They teach that Christ needs to be supplemented.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   That Mary takes part in our salvation, and that you pray to Mary.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   It's an insult to the name of this Jesus. He is the only Savior.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   He doesn't think of any other in any way whatsoever.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   To pray to the saints for help detracts from his glory.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   He is the only Savior.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   And so to talk about a world congress of faiths, or to say that Judaism has got its insights,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   and Hinduism, and Buddhism, and Confucianism, it is a denial of the very elements of the gospel.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   Above all, it is an insult to this one who is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   He said it is finished.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   And to suggest that you can have the so-called sacrifice of the mass,
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   and that he needs to be sacrificed again, and again, and again,
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   is an utter denial of this gospel.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   He's a complete Savior.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   This man keeps on saying that Christ died once and for all, once and forever, never to be repeated.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   In the case, he says, of those earthly priests that you had under the old dispensation,
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   you had to keep on changing your priests. They got older and they died, and you had to appoint new ones,
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   priests and high priests.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   But here is one where all of it.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   He's done something once and forever.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   There is no repetition. There is no need of a repetition, because he has done everything.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   And what this Jesus has done, this Jesus Christ, he has done once and forever.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   And then you see he points out what a complete Savior he is.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   He's introduced a perfect redemption.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   He has perfected forever them that believe in him.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   This is his argument.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   It is an eternal redemption.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   Why? Well, because he didn't offer the blood of bulls and of goats,
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   or some cleansing by means of the ashes of an heifer.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   He offered his own blood.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   The blood of the Son of God incarnate.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   And he's presented it and offered it to his Father.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   And it has been accepted.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   His resurrection proves the completeness of his work.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   It's acceptance with God.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   So as far as his work, which he did on earth, is concerned, it is once and forever.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   No developments in the future, no discoveries of science, no advances in sociology.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   Nothing is going to make the slightest difference.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   Man is a helpless, hopeless, doomed, damned sinner.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   His greatest need is to be reconciled to God.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   Nobody can do it except this one.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   This one who is of the blood of the everlasting covenant.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   This is how God makes peace, says this man.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   And he has done so, and he has done so once and forever.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   But you see the consolation and the comfort he gives us.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   Though we know that these things are true.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   We live in a world that is antagonistic to them.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   And if you stand for these things, you will be persecuted.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   You will be laughed at. You will be treated with derision.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   You will be made to suffer.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   It's all right, says this man. Go on.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   Look at those who torture their slave gone.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   Look at their end especially.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   But look at their whole lives.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   And we must do the same.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   And this is what we find.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   Not only do we know that by the death of Christ and his resurrection,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   that our sins are forgiven and we are reconciled to God.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   We know that we have become sons of God.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   But we are still in this world.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   And it's a difficult and a trying world.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   And there are moments when the world and the flesh and the devil
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   attack us in such a strenuous manner that we are made to shake and to quake.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   What can we do?
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   Well, the hymn puts it like this.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   When all things seem against me to drive me to despair,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   I know one gate is open.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   One ear will hear my prayer.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   How do I know that?
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   I only know it in this way.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   What this man has already been saying at the end of chapter 4 and again in chapter 10.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   In chapter 4 he tells us this.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   That because we have this great high priest who has entered into the heavens,
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   he says you can come with boldness to the throne of grace.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   With boldness? With assurance.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   Why?
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   To God? With boldness? Yes.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   But isn't God an eternal judge?
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   Isn't God awful in his majesty and in his holiness?
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   He is.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   But what this Jesus has done is this.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   He has turned the throne of judgment into a throne of grace.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   I can come boldly to the throne of grace to obtain mercy
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   and to obtain help in time of need.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   When we are in real trouble, we know we can.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   Or as he puts it in chapter 10,
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest of all.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   You don't go to your priest to confess your sins and ask for help.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   You don't pray to the saints so called.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   You don't ask Mary to intercede.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   You don't.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   You go with boldness into the holiest of all,
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   the very presence of God.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Well, how do you manage it?
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   Oh, he says there's a new and a living way.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   You don't have to meander through all the priests
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   and all the ceremonial and the church and the cardinals and the popes.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   You know, I think this new and living way,
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   it always reminds me of the bypasses of these towns of ours.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   Many of us used to have to spend hours going through towns.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   You bypass them now.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   You bypass all the error of Rome.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   You don't have to go through these various channels.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   A new and a living way, he's consecrated it through the veil,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   his broken body by the blood of Jesus.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   We know that we have immediate access into the presence of God.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   We know that he will receive us.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   He's pledged to do it.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   And there, seated at his right hand,
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   ever living to make intercession for us,
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   is this Jesus Christ, our great high priest,
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   our eternal savior.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   But we must, with this, men, thank him for this,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   that though he is now back in the eternal glory.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   You remember how in his high priestly prayer,
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   he turned to his father and he said,
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   "Well, now, give me back that glory which I had with you
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   from the foundation of the world."
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   He'd laid it aside, you see.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   Well, he was in this world.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   He was still God, but the signs of the glory had been laid aside.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   "Let me have them back," he says, "and he has them back."
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   He's seated in glory at the right hand of God.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   As this man has already said in the first chapter,
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   "Who, being the brightness of his glory
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   and the express image of his person,
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   and upholding all things by the word of his power,
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   when he hath by himself purged our sins,
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high."
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   That in itself tends to frighten us, doesn't it?
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   How can we venture to draw an eye?
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   This man gives us the answer.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   We are not an eye priest which cannot be touched
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   with a feeling of our infirmities.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   No, he is one who has been tempted in all points like us we are,
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   yet without sin.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   The fifth chapter says a most daring thing,
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   that he had to learn obedience through the things that he suffered.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   Why? In order that he might sympathize with us.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   He knows all about it.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   He's been through it all.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   He's been tried and tempted in all points like you and I have.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   Never forget this.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   And he's a sympathetic high priest.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   You know one of these hymns.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   It puts it in a very glorious manner.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   "He who for men the surety stood,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   and poured on earth his precious blood,
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   pursues in heaven his mighty plan,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   the savior and the friend of man.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   Though now ascended upon high,
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   bends on earth a brother's eye,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   partaker of the human name,
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   he knows the frailty of our frame.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   Our fellow sufferer yet retains
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   the fellow feeling of our pains,
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   and still remembers in the skies
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   his tears, his agonies, and cries.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   In every pang that rends the heart,
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   the man of sorrows has a part.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   He sympathizes with our grief,
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   and to the sufferer sends relief."
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   What is the conclusion?
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   "With boldness, therefore, at the throne,
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   let us make all our sorrows known,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   and ask the aid of heavenly power
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   to help us in the evil hour."
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   And you'll never ask him in vain.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   He's always ready.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   You know there's a statement that John makes
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   in the first chapter of the book of Revelation
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   that always moves me almost to tears.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   He's ascended upon high.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   He's led captivity captive.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   He's conquered the last enemy.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   He's had all the insignia of his glory
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   returned to him.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   There he is, and John had a vision of him.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   And you remember his description of him.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   He was so marvelous.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   John goes into the details.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   He saw this risen Lord in all his glory,
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   and when he saw it, he fell down as one dead.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   It's not surprising.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   And this is what I read.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   "And he laid his right hand upon me."
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   He's still the same, you see.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   He'd done that with a leper, hadn't he?
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   Oh, he'd mixed with publicans and sinners.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   He's still the same.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   "He laid his hand upon me."
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   And that is what he's ready to do for us, my friends.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   This is the one whom we are to preach.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   Oh, he is great in glory.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   He's still the same.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   And not only that, he has said,
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   "All power is given unto me."
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   This man says that there he's seated at the right hand of God.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   What's he doing?
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   "Waiting until all his enemies shall be made his footstool."
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   There are many things against us.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   The world and the flesh and the devil,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   and all the organization of this world.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   But look to him, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   He could silence the raging of the storm on the sea.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   He could heal the lepers.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   He could make the blind see the deaf to hear,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   the lame to walk and to leap.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   He's still the same.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   And he's conquered all enemies.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   He's conquered the devil.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   He's conquered death and the grave.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   And all power is in his hands.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   These are the things which should comfort and control and encourage us.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   We have an anchor within the valley.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   He's going to prepare a place for us.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   And as this man tells us,
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   "We know that in spite of all that the world and the flesh and the devil are claiming,
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   and all we hear about communism and every other ism of humanism,
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   we know this," as this man puts it,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   "at the end of chapter 9, and as it is appointed unto men once to die,
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   but after this the judgment, so Christ was once offered."
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   They are the sins of many, yesterday.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   "And unto them that look for him," tomorrow,
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   "shall he appear the second time," without sin, apart from sin,
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   "unto salvation."
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   Are these men madmen? No, they're wise men.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   They're going to preach the one who's going to come back into this world, Jesus Christ.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   But does this mean that he's coming back as a baby in a stable?
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   Not at all. But he's still the same.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   He's coming back riding the clouds of heaven,
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   surrounded by the holy angels, conquering unto conquer,
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   King of kings, Lord of lords.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   And he will judge the whole world in righteousness.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   And those of us who believed in him and have followed him
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   will have the privilege of with him judging the world,
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   judging angels, and sharing in his glory forever and forever.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   What a glorious time it is to be preaching the gospel
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   in a bankrupt, hopeless, helpless, tremulous world.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   To tell them of this one, the only one, this unique one,
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   Son of God, Savior of the world, the one who is reigning in the glory,
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   and the one who is coming to set up his glorious kingdom,
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   where there shall be a new heavens and a new earth,
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   What a privilege my friends have and shall have.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   There's nothing comparable to this, to be a herald of this blessed person.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   To tell people of the only certainty in a changing and a collapsing world.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   God bless you as you proceed to do so.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   Let us pray.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   O Lord, our God, we come to thee to offer our prayers.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   For this great privilege thou hast given to us, each and every one of us.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   Thou hast called us out of darkness into thy marvelous light.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   Thou hast enabled us to see the glory of thy dear Son.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   In all his perfection, God and man, perfect Savior,
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   perfect salvation, perfect reign, perfect triumph yet to come.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   Lord, make us all worthy, and especially these our friends,
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   make us worthy of our high calling in Christ Jesus.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   Enable them, enable us all to live to thy glory and to thy praise,
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   and to be the means of leading and of pointing many another unto him,
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   the sight of whose face transfigures everything
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   and enables us to know that we are new creations,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   though still in this old creation which is under judgment and under wrath.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   Lord, use them and bless them, and through them save the people,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   and add yet more and more glory to thy great and holy name.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   We ask it in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
