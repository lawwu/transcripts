[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.740]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.320]   [upbeat music]
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.340]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.240]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.020]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.440]   Today, my guest is Dr. David Anderson.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.380]   Dr. Anderson is a professor of biology
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.960]   at the California Institute of Technology,
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.440]   often commonly referred to as Caltech University.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.080]   Dr. Anderson's research focuses on emotions
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.000]   and states of mind and body.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.500]   And indeed, he emphasizes how emotions like happiness,
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.280]   sadness, anger, and so on are actually subcategories
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.340]   of what are generally governed by states.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.120]   That is, things that are occurring in the nervous system
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.760]   in our brain and in the connections between brain and body
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.480]   that dictate whether or not we feel good
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.660]   about how we are feeling and that drive our behaviors,
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.520]   that is, bias us to be in action or inaction
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.520]   and strongly influence the way we interpret our experience
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.700]   and our surroundings.
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.160]   Today, Dr. Anderson teaches us, for instance,
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.680]   why people become aggressive
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.900]   and why that aggression can sometimes take the form of rage.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.200]   I also talk about sexual behavior and the boundaries
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.640]   and overlap between aggression and sexual behavior.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.600]   And that discussion about aggression and sexual behavior
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.880]   also starts to focus on particular aspects of neural circuits
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.640]   and states of mind and body that govern things like,
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.800]   for instance, male-male aggression
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.760]   versus male-female aggression versus female-female aggression.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.480]   So today you will learn a lot about the biological mechanisms
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.880]   that govern why we feel the way we feel.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.840]   Indeed, Dr. Anderson is an author
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.320]   of a terrific new popular book entitled
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.000]   "The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us."
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.200]   I've read this book several times now.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.040]   I can tell you it contains so many gems
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.520]   that are firmly grounded in the scientific research.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.520]   In fact, a lot of what's in the book
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.660]   contrasts with many of the common myths
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.900]   about emotions and biology.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.520]   So whether or not you're a therapist or you're a biologist
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.500]   or you're simply just somebody interested
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.200]   in why we feel the way we feel
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.120]   and why we act the way we act,
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.920]   I cannot recommend the book highly enough.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.540]   Again, the title is "The Nature of the Beast,
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.220]   How Emotions Guide Us."
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.480]   Today's discussion also ventures into topics
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.120]   such as mental health and mental illness.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.940]   And some of the exciting discoveries
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.740]   that have been made by Dr. Anderson's laboratory
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.600]   and other laboratories identifying specific peptides,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.200]   that is, small proteins that can govern
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.680]   whether or not people feel anxious or less anxious,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.360]   aggressive or less aggressive.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.140]   This is an important area of research
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.480]   that has direct implications
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.560]   for much of what we read about in the news,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.080]   both unfortunate and fortunate events,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.080]   and that will no doubt drive
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.060]   the future of mental health treatments.
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.620]   Dr. Anderson is considered one of the most pioneering
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.840]   and important researchers in neurobiology of our time.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.940]   Indeed, he is a member of the National Academy of Sciences
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.120]   and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.440]   I've mentioned the HHMI once or twice before
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.440]   when we've had other HHMI guests on this podcast,
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.880]   but for those of you that are not familiar,
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.200]   the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.380]   funds a small number of investigators
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.800]   doing particularly high-risk, high-benefit work,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.580]   and it is an extremely competitive process
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.800]   to identify those Howard Hughes investigators.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.540]   They're essentially appointed, and then every five years,
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.720]   they have to compete against one another
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.080]   and against a new incoming flock
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.680]   of would-be HHMI investigators
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.920]   to get another five years of funding.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.100]   They are literally given a grade every five years
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.580]   as to whether or not they can continue, not continue,
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.120]   or whether or not they should worry about being funded
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.540]   for an extended period of time.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.300]   Dr. Anderson has been an investigator
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.860]   with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1989.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.740]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.080]   is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.280]   We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.000]   First of all, they ship internationally
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.900]   because we know that many of you are located
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.400]   outside of the United States.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.420]   Second of all, and perhaps most important,
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.960]   the quality of their supplements is second to none,
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.620]   both in terms of purity and precision
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.580]   of the amounts of the ingredients.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.220]   Third, we've really emphasized supplements
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.300]   that are single-ingredient supplements
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.460]   and that are supplied in dosages
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.440]   that allow you to build a supplementation protocol
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.260]   that's optimized for cost,
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.140]   that's optimized for effectiveness,
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.300]   and that you can add things and remove things
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.620]   from your protocol in a way
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.420]   that's really systematic and scientific.
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.580]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.900]   that we partner with Momentus on,
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.020]   you can go to livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.140]   There you'll see those supplements,
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.620]   and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.300]   the library of supplements available through Momentus
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.260]   on a regular basis.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.860]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.340]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.000]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.220]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.700]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.260]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.340]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.120]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.940]   Our first sponsor is Levels.
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.420]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.020]   how different foods affect your health
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.040]   by giving you real-time feedback on your diet
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.460]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.740]   One of the most important factors
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.500]   governing our immediate and long-term health,
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.620]   and indeed our ability to think and focus clearly,
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.140]   is our blood glucose levels,
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.020]   also referred to as blood sugar.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.160]   To maintain healthy energy and focus throughout the day,
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.120]   you want to keep your blood glucose levels steady
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.500]   and avoid peaks and crashes.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.740]   I first started using Levels about a year ago
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.040]   as a way to better understand how specific foods,
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.940]   food combinations, exercise,
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.420]   and supplements impact my blood glucose levels,
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.180]   and it's been tremendously informative.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.700]   In fact, it's changed and shaped
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.900]   the way that I organize my entire day.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.600]   Levels even provides a simple score after you eat a meal,
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.100]   so you can see how different foods affect you
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.100]   and develop a personalized nutrition program
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.700]   that's ideal for you.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.540]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.500]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.080]   you can go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.400]   That's levels.link/huberman.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.060]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.060]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.980]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.000]   They also have some really unique features
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.500]   because they are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.360]   I've talked over and over again on this podcast
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.680]   and on other podcasts about the fact that sleep
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.700]   is the foundation of mental health,
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.260]   physical health, and performance.
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.100]   There's just simply no other substitute
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.620]   for a quality night's sleep on a regular basis.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.980]   I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.020]   for well over a year now,
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.980]   and it's the best sleep that I've ever had,
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.340]   and that's in large part
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.080]   because the mattress was designed for me.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.080]   What you need to know, however,
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.640]   is what's the ideal mattress for you?
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.980]   And you can do that by going to Helix site.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.340]   You can take their brief quiz, which will ask you,
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.960]   do you sleep on your side, your back, your stomach,
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.580]   or maybe you don't know, or maybe all three,
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.120]   do you tend to run hot or cold in the night?
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.080]   Maybe you know, maybe you don't.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.080]   At the end of that short quiz,
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.780]   they will match you to the ideal mattress for you.
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.100]   I matched to the Dusk, the D-U-S-K mattress,
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.620]   but again, that's what I need.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.780]   That's not necessarily what you need
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.680]   in order to get your best night's sleep.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.220]   But if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.460]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.720]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.540]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you,
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.820]   and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.000]   and two free pillows.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.900]   They have terrific pillows,
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.040]   and you get to try out that mattress
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.220]   for a hundred nights risk-free.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.200]   They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it,
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.380]   but I'm certain you will.
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.220]   Again, if you're interested
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.700]   and you go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.160]   for up to $200 off your mattress order and two free pillows.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.640]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.280]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.700]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't,
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.960]   meaning no sugar, but it has sodium, magnesium,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.740]   and potassium in the proper ratios.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.800]   Sodium, magnesium, and potassium are critical
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.580]   for the functioning of all your cells,
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.280]   but of your neurons, your nerve cells in particular.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.180]   Many people out there, believe it or not,
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.060]   need to ingest more sodium and more potassium
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.080]   and magnesium in the proper ratios to sodium and potassium.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.240]   For those of you that are pre-hypertensive or hypertensive,
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.100]   you definitely don't want to crank up your sodium intake,
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.980]   but many people out there,
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.380]   especially people following low-carb diets
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.500]   or eating exceptionally clean,
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.900]   very well may need more sodium.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.800]   And by drinking Element mixed with water,
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.340]   which is what I do once or twice a day,
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.400]   and certainly also during workouts and after workouts,
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.140]   you can optimize mental functioning
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.620]   and physical performance
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.600]   by increasing your electrolyte balance
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.700]   in the proper ratios.
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.700]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.900]   you can go to drink element, that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.940]   and you'll get a free sample pack with your order.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.300]   Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.400]   to get a free sample pack with your order.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.760]   And now for my discussion with Dr. David Anderson.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.860]   David, great to be here
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.120]   and great to finally sit down and chat with you.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.020]   - Great to be here too, thank you so much.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.420]   - Yeah, I have a ton of questions,
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.260]   but I want to start with something fairly basic,
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.620]   but that I'm aware is a pretty vast landscape.
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.680]   And that's the difference between emotions and states,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.940]   if indeed there is a difference,
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.900]   and how we should think about emotions.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.540]   What are they?
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.200]   They have all these names, happiness, sadness, depression,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.740]   anger, rage.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.980]   How should we think about them?
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.540]   And why might states be at least as useful
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.940]   a thing to think about, if not more useful?
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.380]   - That's great.
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.380]   First, the short answer to your question
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:55.380]   is that I see emotions as a type of internal state,
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.180]   in the sense that arousal is also a type of internal state,
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.300]   motivation's a type of internal state,
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.240]   sleep is a type of internal state.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.540]   And the sort of simplest way I think of internal states
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.540]   is that as you've shown in your own work,
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.380]   they change the input to output transformation of the brain.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.260]   When you're asleep, you don't hear something
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.180]   that you would hear if you were awake,
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.300]   unless it's a really, really loud noise.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.080]   So from that broad perspective,
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:30.080]   I see emotion as a class of state that controls behavior.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.840]   The reason I think it's useful to think about it as a state
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.840]   is it puts the focus on it as a neurobiological process,
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.620]   rather than as a psychological process.
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.500]   And this gets around all of the definitional problems
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.580]   that people have with the word emotion,
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.460]   where many people equate emotion with feeling,
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.460]   which is a subjective sense that we can only study in humans
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.760]   because to find out what someone's feeling,
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.900]   you have to ask them, and people are the only animals
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.260]   that can talk that we can understand.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.540]   So that's how I think about emotion.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.420]   It's the, if you think of an iceberg,
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.580]   it's the heart of the iceberg
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.100]   that's below the surface of the water.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.320]   The feeling part is the tip that's sort of floating
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.700]   above the surface of your consciousness.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.780]   Not that that isn't important, it is,
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.300]   but you have to understand consciousness
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.420]   if you wanna understand feelings,
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.840]   and we're not ready to study that in animals yet.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.480]   And so that's how I think about it.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.120]   What are the different components of a state?
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.620]   You know, you mentioned arousal as a key component.
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.840]   What are some of the other features of states
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.300]   that represent this, as you so beautifully put in your book,
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.320]   that represent below the tip of the iceberg?
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.280]   Right, right.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.280]   So you can break states up
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:03.820]   into different facets, or people would call them dimensions.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.300]   And so there have been people who've thought of emotions
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.100]   as having just really two dimensions,
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:16.100]   an arousal dimension, how intense is it,
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.960]   and also a valence dimension,
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.180]   which is, is it positive or negative, good or bad?
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.380]   Ralph Adolphs and I have tried to expand that a little bit
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.080]   to think about components of emotion,
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.160]   particularly those that distinguish emotion states
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.160]   from motivational states,
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.660]   because they are very closely related.
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.620]   One of those important properties is persistence.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.580]   And this is something that distinguishes
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.380]   state-driven behaviors from simple reflexes.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.380]   Reflexes tend to terminate when the stimulus turns off,
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.500]   like the doctor hitting your knee with a hammer.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.920]   It initiates with the stimulus onset,
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.700]   and it terminates with the stimulus offset.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.380]   Emotions tend to outlast often the stimulus that evoke them.
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.540]   If you're walking along a trail here in Southern California,
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.200]   you hear a rattlesnake rattling,
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.940]   you're gonna jump in the air,
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.300]   but your heart is gonna continue to beat,
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.540]   and your palms sweat, and your mouth is gonna be dry
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.500]   for a while after it slithered off in the bush,
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.220]   and you're gonna be hypervigilant.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.180]   If you see something that even remotely looks snake-like,
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.540]   a stick, you're gonna stop and jump.
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.540]   So persistence is an important feature of emotion states.
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.460]   Not all states have persistence.
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.420]   So for example, you think about hunger.
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.500]   Once you've eaten, the state is gone.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.120]   You're not hungry anymore.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.380]   But if you're really angry
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.260]   and you get into a fight with somebody,
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.100]   even after the fight is over,
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.060]   you may remain riled up for a long time,
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.460]   and it takes you a while to calm down.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.340]   And that may have to do with the arousal dimension
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.660]   or some other part of it.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.920]   And then generalization is an important component
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.920]   of emotion states that make them,
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.380]   if they have been triggered in one situation,
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.400]   they can apply to another situation.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.140]   And my favorite example of that
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.020]   is you come home from work and your kid is screaming.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.580]   If you had a good day at work,
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.020]   you might pick it up and soothe it.
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.960]   And if you had a bad day at work,
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.260]   you might react very differently to it and scream at it.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.260]   And so that's a generalization of the state
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.060]   that was triggered at work by something your boss said to you
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.900]   to a completely different interaction.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.480]   And again, that's something that distinguishes
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.460]   emotion states from motivation states.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.220]   Motivation states are really specific.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.220]   Find and eat food, obtain and consume water.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.940]   And they're involved in homeostatic maintenance.
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:11.940]   So states are very multifaceted
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.940]   and just asking questions
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.740]   about how these components of states are encoded.
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.660]   Like what makes a state persist?
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.340]   What gives a state a positive or a negative valence?
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.280]   How do you crank up or crank down the intensity of the state?
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.900]   It just opens up a whole bunch of questions
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.160]   that you can ask in the brain
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.200]   with the kinds of tools we have now.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.140]   You mentioned arousal a few times
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.500]   and you mentioned valence.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.700]   Realizing that there are these other aspects of states,
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.860]   I'd like to just talk about arousal a little bit more
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.280]   and valence, because at a very basic level,
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.020]   it seems to me that arousal, we can be very alert
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.740]   and pissed off, stressed, worried.
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.180]   You have insomnia.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.500]   We can also be very alert and be quite happy.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.980]   So the valence flips.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.340]   We can be very, people can be sexually aroused.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.220]   People can be aroused in all sorts of ways.
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:16.220]   Is there any simple or simple-ish neurochemical signature
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.980]   that can flip valence?
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.840]   So for instance, is there any way that we can safely say
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.700]   that arousal with some additional dopamine release
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.240]   is going to be of positive valence
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.660]   and arousal with very low dopamine
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.860]   is going to be of negative valence?
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:39.340]   I would be reluctant to say that it's a chemical flip.
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.260]   I would say it's more likely to be a circuit flip,
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.060]   different circuits being engaged.
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.100]   And it might be that a given neurochemical,
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.660]   even dopamine is involved in both positively valenced arousal
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.060]   and negatively valenced arousal.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:59.300]   That's why people think about these as different axes.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.300]   So I think the interesting question that you touch on
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.000]   is, is arousal something that is just completely generic
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.500]   in the brain, or are there actually different kinds
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.340]   of arousal that are specific to different behaviors?
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.720]   And you raise the question, sexual arousal feels different
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.540]   from aggressive arousal, for example.
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.100]   And we actually published a paper on this back in 2009
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.980]   in Fruit Flies, where we found some evidence
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.860]   for two types of arousal states,
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.680]   one of which is sleep-wake arousal.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.400]   You're more aroused when you wake up
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.900]   and when you're asleep, and flies show that.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.900]   And the other is a startle response, an arousal response
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.820]   to a mechanical stimulus, a noxious mechanical stimulus.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:52.620]   If you puff air on flies, kind of like trying to swat
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.640]   the wasp away from your burger at the picnic table,
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.700]   they come back more and more and more vigorously.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.820]   And we were able to dissect this and show
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.240]   that although both of those forms of arousal
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.320]   require dopamine, they were exerted
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.500]   through completely separable neural circuits in the fly.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.220]   And so that really put, number one, the emphasis on,
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.660]   it's the circuit that determines the type of arousal,
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.140]   but also that arousal isn't unitary,
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.420]   that there are behavior-specific forms of arousal.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.380]   And I think the jury is still out as to whether
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.380]   there is such a thing as completely generalized arousal or not.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.440]   I think some people would argue there is,
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.920]   but I think more attention needs to be paid
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.820]   to this question of domain-specific
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.640]   or behavior-specific forms of arousal.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.220]   Yeah, it's a super interesting idea,
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.240]   'cause I always thought of arousal as along a continuum,
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.060]   like you can either be in a panic attack
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.320]   at the one end of the extreme, or you can be in a coma.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.720]   And then somewhere in the middle, you're alert and calm.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.600]   But then this issue of valence really, as you say,
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.000]   presents this opportunity that really there might be
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.100]   multiple circuits for arousal or multiple mechanisms
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.940]   that would include neurochemicals
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.260]   as well as different neural pathways.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.160]   So I'd like to talk a bit about a state,
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.080]   if it is indeed a state, which is aggression.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.520]   Your lab's worked extensively on this.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.920]   And if you would, could you highlight
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.040]   some of the key findings there?
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.560]   Which brain areas are involved?
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.120]   The beautiful work of Dai-Yu Lin and others in your lab
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.440]   that point to the idea that indeed
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.140]   there are kind of switches in the brain,
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.240]   but that thinking of switches for aggression
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.720]   might be too simple.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.360]   How should we think about aggression?
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.960]   And I'll just sort of skew the question a bit more
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.800]   by saying we see lots of different kinds of aggression.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.360]   This terrible school shooting down in Texas recently,
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.320]   clearly an act that included aggression.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.200]   And yet you could imagine
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.480]   that's a very different type of aggression than a,
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.920]   you know, an all outrage or a controlled aggression.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.680]   You know, there's a lot of variation there.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.040]   So what are your thoughts on aggression,
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.000]   how it's generated the neural circuit mechanisms
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.840]   and some of the variation in what we call aggression?
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.360]   Yeah, this is a great question.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.680]   And it's a large area.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:22.680]   I would say that the, first of all, the word aggression
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:28.360]   in my mind refers more to a description of behavior
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.300]   than it does to an internal state.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.320]   Aggression could reflect an internal state
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.320]   that we would call anger in humans or could reflect fear,
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.120]   or it could reflect hunger if it's predatory aggression.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.720]   And so this gets at the issue that you raised
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.440]   of the different types of aggression that exist.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.760]   The work that Dayu did when she was in my lab
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.760]   that really broke open the field
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.800]   to the application of modern genetic tools
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.040]   for studying circuits in mice
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   is that she found a way to evoke aggression in mice
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.960]   using optogenetics to activate specific neurons
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.360]   in a region of the hypothalamus,
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.360]   the ventromedial hypothalamus, VMH,
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.360]   which people had been studying and looking at for decades,
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:32.400]   following first the work of, in "Cats,"
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.500]   the famous Nobel Prize winning work of Walter Hess,
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.080]   and then followed by work done by Meno Crook
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.620]   in the Netherlands, in "Rats,"
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.980]   where they would stick electrical wires into the brain
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.780]   and send electric currents into the brain,
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.860]   and they could trigger a placid cat
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.080]   to suddenly bare its teeth, hiss,
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.520]   and almost strike out at the experimenter,
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.500]   and they could trigger rats to fight with each other.
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.220]   And even in Hess's original experiments,
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.020]   he describes two types of aggression
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.360]   that he evokes from cats depending on where
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.720]   in the hypothalamus he puts his electrode,
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.040]   one of which he calls defensive rage,
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.360]   that's the ears laid back, teeth bared and hissing,
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.560]   and the other one is predatory aggression,
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.660]   where the cat has its ears forward
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.440]   and it's like batting with its paw at a mouse-like object
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.800]   like it wants to catch it and eat it.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.740]   So he already had at that stage some information
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.820]   about segregation in the brain
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.780]   of different forms of aggression.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.260]   So fast forward to 2008, 2009,
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:54.780]   when Dayu came to the lab,
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.180]   and we had started working on aggression in fruit flies,
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.860]   and I wanted to bring it into mice
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.260]   so that we could apply genetic tools.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:08.180]   And we started by having Dayu, who was an electrophysiologist,
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.780]   just repeat the electrical stimulation
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.240]   of the ventromedial hypothalamus in the mouse,
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.340]   just like people had done in rats, in cats, in hamsters,
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.760]   even in monkeys, and she could not get that experiment
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.420]   to work over 40 different trials.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.540]   It just didn't work.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.120]   What she got instead was fear behaviors.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.800]   She got freezing, cornering, and crouching.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.100]   And finally, in desperation,
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.800]   and we got a lot of input from Meno Crook on this,
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.840]   he really was mystified, why doesn't it work in mice?
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.720]   We realized why there had been no paper
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:52.480]   on brain-stimulated aggression in mice in 50 years,
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.900]   'cause the experiment doesn't work.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.200]   And the one bit of credit I can claim there
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.300]   is I convinced Dayu to try optogenetics,
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:08.300]   because it just had sort of come into use
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.120]   deep in the brain from Carl Deiss-Roth and others' work.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.180]   And I thought maybe because it could be directed
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.400]   more specifically to a region of the brain
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.580]   and types of cells and optogenetic stimulation,
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.540]   then electrical stimulation, it might work.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.780]   And Dayu said, "Never, never gonna work.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.520]   "If it doesn't work with electricity,
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.700]   "why should it work with optogenetics?"
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.480]   And the fact is that it did work,
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:40.140]   and we were able to trigger aggression in this region
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.040]   using optogenetic stimulation of ventromedial hypothalamus.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.620]   And in retrospect, I think the reason
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.320]   that we were seeing all these fear behaviors
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.780]   is because right at the upper part,
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.860]   if you think of ventromedial hypothalamus like a pear
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.220]   sitting on the ground, the fat part of the pear
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.880]   near the ground is where the aggression neurons are,
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.520]   but the upper part of the pear has fear neurons.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.120]   And it could be because it's so small in a mouse,
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.160]   when you inject electrical current anywhere in the pear,
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.680]   it flows up through the entire pear
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.780]   and it activates the fear circuits,
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.800]   and those totally dominate aggression.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.540]   And so that's why we were never able to see
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.020]   any fighting with electrical stimulation,
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.740]   whereas when you use optogenetics,
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:34.100]   you confine the stimulation just to the region
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.500]   where you've implanted the channelrhodopsin gene
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.960]   into those neurons.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.640]   And so fast forward from that, from a lot of work
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.820]   from Dayu now on her own at NYU,
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.020]   and with her postdoc, Anna-Gret Faulkner,
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.560]   there's, as well as work of other people,
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.380]   there's evidence that the type of fighting
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.820]   that we elicit when we stimulate VMH
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:06.820]   is offensive aggression that is actually rewarding
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.380]   to male mice. They like it.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.320]   They like it.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.240]   Male mice will press, learn to poke their nose
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.380]   or press a bar to get the opportunity
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.020]   to beat up a subordinate male mouse.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.260]   And in more recent experiments,
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.940]   if you activate those neurons and the mouse has a chance
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.100]   to be in one of two compartments in a box,
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.260]   they will gravitate towards the compartment
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.460]   where those neurons are activated.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.980]   It has a positive valence.
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.460]   And when I went into this field and I was thinking,
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:43.460]   well, what goes on in my brain and my body when I'm furious?
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.500]   It certainly doesn't feel like a rewarding experience.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.180]   It's not something that I would want to repeat
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.640]   because it feels good when I'm in that state.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.580]   It doesn't feel good at all when I'm in that state.
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.300]   And it is still, I think, a mystery
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.300]   as to where that type of aggression,
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.840]   which is more defensive aggression,
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.100]   the kind of aggression you feel if you're being attacked
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.020]   or if you've been cheated by somebody,
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.780]   where that is encoded in the brain and how that works still,
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.980]   I think is a very important mystery that we haven't solved.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.260]   And predatory aggression there has been some progress on.
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.540]   So mice show predatory aggression.
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.260]   They use that to catch crickets that they eat,
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.780]   and that involves different circuits
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.780]   than the ventromedial hypothalamic circuits.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.700]   So it's become clear that if you want to call it
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.700]   the state of aggressiveness is multifaceted.
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.580]   It depends on the type of aggression
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.820]   and it involves different sorts of circuits.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:52.140]   There's a paper suggesting that there might be
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:57.140]   a final common pathway for all aggression in a region,
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.220]   which is one of my favorites.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.800]   It's called the substantia in naminata,
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.940]   the substance with no name.
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:04.780]   I like-
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.340]   The anatomists are so creative.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.260]   Or the nucleus ambiguous, or the zona inserta.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.140]   These are places that no one can think of what they are.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.080]   Anyhow, that might be a final common pathway
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.820]   for predatory aggression and offensive
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.460]   and defensive aggression.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.620]   But it can be really hard to tell
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.500]   just from looking at a mouse fight,
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.660]   whether it's engaged in offensive or defensive aggression.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.480]   We've tried to take that apart
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.620]   using machine learning analysis of behavior.
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.940]   But in rats, for example, it's much clearer
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.100]   when the animal is engaged in offensive
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.860]   versus defensive aggression.
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.660]   They direct their bites at different parts
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.080]   of the opponent's body.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.920]   In particular-
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.240]   Neck versus offensive aggression is flank directed.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.880]   Defensive aggression goes for the neck,
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.200]   goes for the throat.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.500]   I've seen some nature specials
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.860]   where in a very barbaric way, at least to me,
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.700]   it seems like hyenas will try and go after
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.180]   the reproductive axis.
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.420]   They'll go after testicles and penis.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.860]   And they basically want to,
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.540]   it seems they want to limit future breeding potential.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.740]   - Or create pain.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.720]   - Or create pain or both.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.820]   Yeah, I mean, in terms of offensive aggression
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:23.220]   and your reflection that it doesn't feel good.
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.500]   I mean, I can say,
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.080]   I know some people who really enjoy fighting.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.460]   I have a relative who is a lawyer.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.160]   He loves to argue and fight.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.740]   I don't think of him as physically aggressive.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.580]   In fact, he's not,
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.580]   but loves to fight and loves to prosecute
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.380]   and go after people and he's pretty effective at it.
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.500]   I have a friend, former military special operations
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.260]   and very calm guy,
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.780]   had a great career in military special operations.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.700]   And he'll quite plainly say, I love to fight.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.380]   It's one of my great joys.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.860]   He really enjoyed his work.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.840]   And also respected the other side
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.820]   because they offered the opportunity to test that
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.060]   and to experience that joy.
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.980]   So in a kind of bizarre way to somebody like me
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.780]   who I'll certainly defend my stance if I need to,
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.860]   but I certainly don't consider myself
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.980]   somebody who offensively goes after people
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:13.820]   just to go after them.
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:17.260]   There's no quote unquote dopamine hit here,
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.900]   acknowledging that dopamine does many things, of course.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.340]   I have a couple of questions
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.060]   about the way you describe the circuitry.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.900]   I should say the way the circuitry is arranged.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.060]   And of course we don't know
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.620]   because we weren't consulted at the design phase,
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.940]   but why do you think there would be such a close positioning
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.260]   of neurons that can elicit
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.280]   such divergent states and behaviors?
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.580]   I mean, you're talking about this pear shaped structure
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:47.260]   where the neurons that generate fear are cheek to jowl
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.480]   with the neurons that generate offensive aggression
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.680]   of all things.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.940]   It's like putting the neurons that control swallowing
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.000]   next to the neurons that control vomiting.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.860]   It just seems to me that on the one hand,
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.060]   this is the way that neural circuits are often arranged.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.620]   And yet to me, it's always been perplexing
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.300]   as to why this would be the case.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.200]   Yeah, I think that is a very profound question.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.180]   And I've wondered about that a lot.
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:19.120]   If you think from an evolutionary perspective,
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:25.060]   it might have been the case that defensive behaviors
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:30.060]   and fear arose before offensive aggression.
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.840]   Because animals first and foremost
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.200]   have to defend themselves from predation by other animals.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.280]   And maybe it's only when they're comfortable
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.300]   with having warded off predation and made themselves safe
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.920]   that they can start to think about
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.900]   who's gonna be the alpha male in my group here.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.420]   And so it could be that if you think that brain regions
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:00.260]   and cell populations evolved by duplication
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:05.260]   and modification of preexisting cell populations,
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.700]   that might be the way that those regions
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.760]   wound up next to each other.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.340]   And developmentally, they start out
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.780]   from a common pool of precursors
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.580]   that expresses the same gene,
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.300]   the fear neurons and the aggression neurons.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.580]   And then with development,
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.100]   it gets shut off in the aggression neurons
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.660]   and maintained in the fear neurons.
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.980]   Now that view says, oh, it's just an,
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.700]   it's an accident of evolution and development,
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.180]   but I think there must be a functional part as well.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.900]   So one thing we know about offensive aggression
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:42.540]   is that strong fear shuts it down.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.180]   Whereas defensive aggression, at least in rats,
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.780]   is actually enhanced by fear.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.500]   It's one of the big differences
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.300]   between defensive aggression and offensive aggression.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.960]   And you think about it, if you think about it,
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.300]   if offensive aggression is rewarding and pleasurable,
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.660]   if you start to get really scared,
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.780]   that tends to take the fun out of it.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.140]   And maybe these two regions are close to each other
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:12.140]   to facilitate inhibition of aggression by the fear neurons.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.600]   We know for a fact that if we deliberately stimulate
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.420]   those fear neurons at the top of the pair,
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.540]   when two animals are involved in a fight,
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.320]   it just stops the fight dead in its tracks
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.040]   and they go off into the corner and freeze.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.860]   So at least hierarchically, it seems like fear
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.380]   is the dominant behavior over offensive aggression.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.380]   And how that inhibition would work is not clear
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.980]   'cause all these neurons are pretty much excitatory.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.060]   They're almost all glutamatergic.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:45.780]   And so one of the interesting questions for the future
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:49.300]   is how exactly does fear dominate over
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.700]   and shut down offensive aggression in the brain?
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:53.700]   How does that work?
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.780]   Is it all circuitry?
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.540]   Are there chemicals involved?
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.340]   What's the mechanism and when is it called into play?
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.260]   But I think that's the way I tend to think about
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.420]   why these neurons are all mixed up together.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:10.520]   And it's not just fight and freezing or fight and flight.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.100]   There are also metabolic neurons
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.060]   that are mixed together in VMH as well.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.380]   Controlling body-wide metabolism?
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.780]   Yeah, there are neurons there that respond to glucose.
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.820]   When glucose goes up in your bloodstream, they're activated.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:30.200]   And VMH has a whole history in the field of obesity
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:35.200]   because if you destroy it in a rat, you get a fat rat.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.260]   So the way most of the world thinks about VMH
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.300]   is they think about, oh, that's the thing
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.140]   that keeps you from getting fat.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.200]   It's the anti-obesity area.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.220]   But in the area of social behavior,
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.620]   we see it as a center for control
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.860]   of aggression and fear behaviors.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:56.420]   And again, why these neurons and these functions,
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.420]   I like to call them the four Fs,
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.820]   feeding, freezing, fighting, and mating,
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.340]   that they all seem to be closely intermingled
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.500]   with each other, maybe because crosstalk between them
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.580]   is very important to help the animal's brain
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.860]   decide what behavior to prioritize
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.300]   and what behavior to shut down at any given moment.
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.020]   One of the things that we will do is link
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:22.360]   to the incredible videos of these mice
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.460]   that have selective stimulation of neurons in the VMH,
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.700]   DAUs and the other studies that you've done.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:32.700]   Whenever I teach, I show those videos at some point
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:36.580]   with the caveats and warnings that are required
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.840]   when one is about to see a video of a mouse
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.060]   trying to mate with another mouse
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.420]   or mating with another mouse,
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.160]   and they seem both to be quite happy
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.540]   about the mating experience,
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.080]   at least as far as we know, as observers of mice.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:55.180]   And then upon stimulation of those VMH neurons,
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:58.900]   one of the mice essentially tries to kill the other mouse.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.780]   And then when that stimulation is stopped,
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.660]   they basically go back to hanging out.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.180]   They don't go right back to mating.
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.580]   There's some reconciliation, clearly,
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.840]   that needs to happen first, we assume.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.140]   But it's just so striking.
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.700]   I think equally striking is the video
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.740]   where the mouse is alone in there
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.320]   with the glove, the VMH neurons are stimulated,
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.140]   and the mouse goes into a rage.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.980]   It looks like it wants to kill the glove, basically.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:23.820]   So striking.
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.520]   I encourage people to go watch those
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.700]   because it really puts a tremendous amount of color
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.840]   on what we're describing.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:34.920]   And it's just the idea that there are switches in the brain,
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.420]   to me, really became clear upon seeing that.
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.400]   One of the concepts, excuse me,
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.060]   one of the concepts that you've raised
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.140]   in your lectures before,
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.340]   and that I think was Hess's idea,
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.580]   is this idea of a sort of hydraulic pressure,
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.220]   or maybe it was Conrad, I can't speak now, excuse me,
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.420]   Conrad Lorenz, who talked about
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.260]   a kind of hydraulic pressure towards behavior.
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.100]   I'm fascinated by this idea of hydraulic pressure
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.220]   because I don't consider myself a hot-tempered person,
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.420]   but I am familiar with the fact that when I lose my temper,
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.740]   it takes quite a while for me to simmer down.
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.260]   I can't think about anything else.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.680]   I don't want to think about anything else.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.400]   In fact, trying to think about anything else
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.420]   becomes aversive to me,
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:21.940]   which to me underscores this notion of prioritization
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.400]   of the different states and potentially conflicting states.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.620]   What do you think funnels into this idea
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.060]   of hydraulic pressure toward a state?
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:36.060]   And why is it perhaps that sometimes we can be very angry
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.800]   and if we succeed in winning an argument,
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.960]   all of a sudden it will subside?
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.860]   Because clearly that means
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.360]   that there are external influences.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.180]   It's a complex space here that we're creating.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.700]   I realize I'm creating a bit of a cloud
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.880]   and I'm doing it on purpose because to me,
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.820]   the idea of a hydraulic pressure towards a state,
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.140]   like sleep, there's a sleep pressure.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.460]   There's a pressure towards a, that all makes sense.
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.060]   But what's involved?
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.740]   Is it too multifactorial
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.660]   to actually separate out the variables?
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.540]   But what's really driving hydraulic pressure
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.060]   toward a given state?
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:11.980]   Yeah, so really important question.
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.440]   I think one way that is helpful,
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.280]   at least for me to break this question apart
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.400]   and think about it,
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.960]   is to distinguish homeostatic behaviors
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.240]   that is need-based behaviors,
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:29.420]   where the pressure is built up because of a need,
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:33.360]   like I'm hungry, I need to eat, I'm thirsty,
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:38.140]   I need to drink, I'm hot, I need to get to a cold place.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.680]   It's basically the thermostat model of your brain.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.960]   You have a set point
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.800]   and then if the temperature gets too hot,
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.960]   you turn on the AC and if the temperature gets too cold,
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.920]   you turn on the heater
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.120]   and you put yourself back to the set point.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.760]   I don't think that's how aggression works.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.780]   That is, it's not that we all go around,
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:57.920]   at least subjectively.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:02.680]   I don't go around with an accumulating need to fight,
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:07.200]   which I then look for something, an excuse to release it.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.000]   Now, maybe there are people that do that
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.440]   and they go out and look for bar fights to get into.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.280]   Or Twitter.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.200]   Yeah, or Twitter.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.360]   Twitter seems to do, I'm sort of half joking
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.440]   because Twitter seems to draw a reasonably sized crowd
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.440]   of people that are there for combat of some sort.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.440]   Even though the total intellectual power
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.920]   of any of their comments is about that of a cap gun,
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.480]   they seem to really like to fire off that cap gun.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.720]   But I agree.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.960]   Before we continue with today's discussion,
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.040]   I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor,
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.240]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.520]   Athletic Greens, AKA AG1,
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.960]   is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.040]   that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.760]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012,
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.180]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.800]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.740]   and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.640]   is that it supplies total foundational coverage
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.060]   of my vitamin mineral needs,
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.980]   and it supplies important nutrients that I need
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.540]   to support my gut microbiome.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.260]   The gut microbiome, as many of you know,
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.380]   supports the immune system.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.400]   It also supports the so-called gut-brain axis,
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.780]   which is vital for mood, for energy levels,
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.020]   for regulating focus,
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.860]   and many other features of our mental health
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.180]   and physical health that impact our daily performance
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.820]   and high performance in any endeavors
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.220]   we might be involved in.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.600]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.300]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.860]   and claim a special offer.
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.540]   They're giving away five free travel packs
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:34.420]   plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2 with every order.
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.660]   And of course, vitamin D3K2 are vital
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.740]   for all sorts of things like hormone health
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.140]   and metabolic health and K2 for cardiovascular health
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.340]   and calcium regulation.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.540]   Again, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.860]   to claim that special offer.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:51.860]   - So you can think of this accumulated hydraulic pressure
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:55.540]   either being based on something that you were deprived of
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.980]   creating an accumulating need
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.580]   or something that you want to do,
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.940]   building up a drive or a pressure to do that.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:09.020]   And the natural way to think about that, at least for me,
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:13.560]   is as gradual increases in neural activity
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.980]   in a particular region of the brain.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.540]   And so for example,
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:21.440]   in the area of the hypothalamus that controls feeding,
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.900]   Scott Sternson and others have shown
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.260]   that the hungrier you get,
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:30.260]   the higher the level of activity in that region in the brain.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.960]   And then when you eat, boom,
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.620]   the activity goes right back down again.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.660]   And that state is actually negatively valence.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.860]   So it's like the animal quote unquote,
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.580]   feels increasingly uncomfortable,
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.180]   just like we feel increasingly uncomfortable
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.620]   the hungrier we are.
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.000]   And then when we eat, it taps it down.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.340]   But there is this increased activity.
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.500]   And I think in the case of aggression,
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:59.140]   our data and others show that the more strongly
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:03.680]   you drive this region of the brain optogenetically,
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.280]   the more of just a hair trigger you need
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.300]   to set the animal off to get it to fight.
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.600]   Now, the interesting thing is that
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:15.820]   if there is nothing for the animal to attack,
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.580]   it doesn't really do much
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.700]   when you're stimulating this region.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.180]   It sort of wanders around the cage a little bit more,
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:27.740]   but it will not actually show overt attack
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:29.660]   unless you put something in front of it.
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.340]   And the same thing is true for the areas we've described
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.500]   that control mating behavior.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.420]   This is what Lindsay is working on.
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:40.040]   You can stimulate those areas till you're blue in the face
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.220]   and the mouse just sort of wanders around.
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.060]   But if you put another mouse in, wham,
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.820]   he will try to mount that mouse.
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.060]   If you put a kumquat in the cage,
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.240]   he'll try to mount the kumquat.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.880]   And so it becomes a sort of any port in the storm.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.880]   So there is this idea that the drive is building up pressure
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:03.600]   that somehow needs to be released
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.700]   where that pressure is actually being exerted.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.320]   If you accept that it's increased activity
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.960]   in some circuit or circuits someplace,
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.960]   what is it pushing up against that needs something else
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.900]   to sort of unplug it in the Lorentz hydraulic model?
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.100]   That is, you don't see the behavior
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.940]   until you release a valve on this bucket
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.460]   and let the accumulated pressure flow out.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.980]   And that's one of the things we're trying to study
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:37.440]   in the context of the mating behavior as well.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.620]   How does the information that there's an object
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.060]   in front of you come together with this drive state
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.020]   that is generated by stimulating these neurons
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:50.880]   in the hypothalamus to say, okay, pull the trigger and go,
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.540]   it's time to mate, it's time to attack.
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.840]   And we're just starting to get some insights into that now.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.700]   - Fascinating, and I should mention to people,
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.020]   Dr. Anderson mentioned Lindsay.
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:02.640]   Lindsay is a former graduate student of mine
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.480]   that's now a postdoc in David's lab.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.360]   And I haven't caught up with her recently
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.080]   to hear about these experiments, but they sound fascinating.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.660]   I would love to spend some time on this issue
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:15.980]   of why is it that a mouse won't attack nothing,
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.020]   but it'll attack even a glove
[00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:22.060]   and why it will only try and mate
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.580]   if there's another mouse to mate with.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:28.340]   It's actually, I think fortunately for you,
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:29.460]   you're not spending a lot of time
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.460]   on Twitter and Instagram or YouTube,
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.460]   but there's this whole online community that exists now.
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:39.900]   As far as I know, it's almost exclusively young males
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.860]   who are obsessed with this idea.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.000]   I'll just say it, it has a name.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.440]   It's called NoFap of no masturbation
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.520]   as a way to maintain their motivation to go out
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.760]   and actually seek mates
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.180]   because of the ready availability of online pornography.
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:57.340]   There's probably a much larger population of young males
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.200]   that are never actually going out and seeking mates
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.740]   because they're getting porn addicted, et cetera.
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.620]   There's actually a serious issue that came up in our episode
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:07.400]   with Ana Lemke who wrote the book "Dopamine Nation"
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.420]   because the availability of pornography,
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.380]   there's a whole social context that's being created
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.760]   around this and genuine addiction.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.020]   So humans are not like the mice
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.520]   or mice are not like the humans.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.400]   Humans seem to resolve the issue on their own
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.920]   in ways that might actually impede seeking
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.800]   and finding of sexual partners and or long-term mates.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.500]   So serious issue there.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.980]   I raise it as a serious issue that I hear a lot about
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.380]   'cause I get asked hundreds,
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.880]   if not thousands of questions about this.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.900]   Is there any physiological basis for what they call NoFap?
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.800]   And I never actually replied 'cause there's no data,
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.080]   but what you're raising here is a very interesting
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.640]   mechanistic scenario that can,
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.540]   as you mentioned, is being explored.
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:54.540]   So what do we know about the internal state of a mouse
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.040]   whose VMH is being stimulated
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.680]   or a mouse whose other brain region
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.360]   that can stimulate the desire to mate?
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.660]   What do we know about the internal state of that mouse
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.540]   if it's just alone in the cage wandering around?
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.580]   Is it wandering around really wanting to mate
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:10.700]   and really wanting to fight?
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:15.420]   We of course don't know, but is its heart rate up?
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.300]   Is its blood pressure up?
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.940]   Is it wishing that there was pornography?
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:24.020]   Is it something's going on, presumably,
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:29.020]   that's different than prior to that stimulation?
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.280]   And is it arousal?
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.780]   And what do you think it is about the visual
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.000]   or olfactory perception of a conspecific
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.400]   that ungates this tremendous repertoire of behaviors?
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.860]   Right, that is the central question.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.760]   I can say, at least with respect to the fear neurons
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.760]   that sit on top of the aggression neurons,
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:54.400]   we know that when those neurons are activated optogenetically
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.700]   in the same way we would activate the aggression neurons,
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.320]   that there's clearly an arousal process that's occurring.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.360]   You can see the pupils dilate in the animal.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.700]   There is an increase in stress hormone release
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.140]   into the bloodstream.
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.780]   We've shown that.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.560]   Heart rate goes up.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:17.340]   So in addition to the drive to actually freeze,
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.700]   which is what those animals do,
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:24.700]   there is autonomic arousal and neuroendocrine activation
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.220]   of stress responses.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.060]   And some of that is probably shared
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:32.220]   by the aggression neurons and the mating neurons,
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:35.460]   although we haven't investigated it in as much detail.
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.780]   But I wouldn't be surprised because they project
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:40.960]   to many of the same regions
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:44.380]   that the fear neurons project to,
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:47.640]   which is a interesting issue in the context
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.640]   to discuss later maybe in the context
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.660]   of why we're comfortable with mental illnesses
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:55.020]   that are based on maladaptations of fear,
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.300]   but not mental illnesses that are based
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.800]   on maladaptations of aggression
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.540]   if they have pretty similar circuits in the brain.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.660]   But that's how I would imagine
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:08.860]   there is an arousal dimension, as you say.
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.940]   There are stress hormones that are activated.
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:15.600]   These regions, VMH projects to about 30 different regions
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.400]   in the brain, and it gets input
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.100]   from about 30 different regions.
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:23.460]   So I kind of see it as both an antenna
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.200]   and a broadcasting center.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.800]   It's like a satellite dish that takes in information
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.260]   from different sensory modalities, smell,
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.080]   maybe vision, mechanosensation,
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.920]   and then it sort of synthesizes and integrates that
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.020]   into a fairly low dimensional,
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.660]   as the computational people call it,
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.860]   representation of this pressure to attack,
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.820]   and it broadcasts that all over the brain
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.740]   to trigger all these systems
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.820]   that have to be brought into play
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.540]   if the animal is gonna engage in aggression,
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.400]   because aggression is a very risky thing
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.080]   for an animal to engage in.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:06.800]   It could wind up losing and it could wind up getting killed.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.340]   And so its brain constantly has to make
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:14.480]   a cost benefit analysis of whether to continue on that path
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.440]   or to back off as well.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.620]   And I think that part of this broadcasting function
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:24.620]   of this region is engaging all these other brain domains
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:29.320]   that play a role in this kind of cost benefit analysis.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.380]   I wanna talk more about mating behavior,
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.660]   but as a segue to that,
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:37.060]   as we're talking about aggression and mating behavior,
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.440]   I think hormones.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.020]   And whenever there's an opportunity on this podcast
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:44.700]   to shatter a common myth, I grab it.
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.880]   One of the common myths that's out there,
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.220]   and I think that persists,
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:52.780]   is that testosterone makes animals and humans aggressive,
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.820]   and estrogen makes animals placid and kind or emotional.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.240]   And as we both know,
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.980]   nothing could be further from the truth,
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.300]   although there's some truth to the idea
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.880]   that these hormones are all involved.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.340]   Robert Sapolsky supplied some information to me
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.780]   when he came on this podcast
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.620]   that if you give people exogenous testosterone,
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.540]   it tends to make them more of the way they were before.
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.640]   If they were a jerk before, they'll become more of a jerk.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.100]   If they were very altruistic, they'll become more altruistic.
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.660]   And then eventually I pointed out,
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.820]   you'll rheumatize that testosterone into estrogen
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.100]   and you'll start getting opposite effects.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.020]   So it's a murky space, it's not straightforward.
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.780]   But if I'm not mistaken,
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.500]   testosterone plays a role in generating aggression.
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:38.220]   However, the specific hormones that are involved
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.780]   in generating aggression via VMH
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:44.300]   are things other than testosterone.
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.620]   Can you tell us a little bit more about that?
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:47.740]   'Cause there's some interesting surprises in there.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.220]   Yeah, that's a really important question.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:55.220]   So when we finally identified the neurons in VMH
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.840]   that control aggression with a molecular marker,
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:02.660]   we found out that that marker was the estrogen receptor.
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:05.100]   So that might strike you as a little strange.
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:10.100]   Why should aggression promoting neurons in male mice
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.540]   be labeled with the estrogen receptor?
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.340]   Other labs have shown that the estrogen receptor
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:20.980]   in adult male mice is necessary for aggression.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.940]   If you knock out the gene in VMH, they don't fight.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.380]   And it's been shown, and a lot of this is work
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.900]   from your colleague Nirav Shah at Stanford,
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.740]   who is one of my former PhD students,
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:36.220]   that if you castrate a mouse
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:39.220]   and it loses the ability to fight,
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:43.960]   not only can you rescue fighting with a testosterone implant
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:46.780]   but you can rescue it with an estrogen implant.
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:50.040]   So you can bypass completely the requirement
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:54.020]   for testosterone to restore aggressiveness to the mice.
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:57.420]   And as you say, it's because many of the effects
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.160]   of testosterone, although not all,
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:04.620]   many of them are mediated by its conversion to estrogen
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.420]   by a process called aromatization.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:10.980]   It's carried out by an enzyme called aromatase.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.580]   In fact, people may have, most of your listeners
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:17.600]   may have heard of aromatase 'cause aromatase inhibitors
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.560]   are widely used in female humans
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.600]   as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:28.600]   They are a way of reducing the production of estrogen
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.000]   by preventing testosterone
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.220]   from being converted into estrogen.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.380]   And in fact, there are a lot of animal experiments
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:38.920]   showing if you give males aromatase inhibitors,
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.260]   they stop fighting,
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:44.880]   as well as also stop being sexually active.
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:48.460]   And so that's one of the counterintuitive ideas.
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:51.500]   And Nirao has shown that progesterone
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.160]   also seems to play a role in aggression
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.720]   because these aggression neurons
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.660]   also express the progesterone receptor.
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:02.180]   So here are two hormones that are classically thought of
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.700]   as female reproductive hormones.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:08.140]   This is what goes up and goes down during the estrus cycle,
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.080]   estrogen and progesterone.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.340]   And yet they're playing a very important role
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:17.200]   in controlling aggression in male mice
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.000]   and presumably in male humans as well.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.280]   Fascinating.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.760]   So estrogen is doing many more things
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.420]   than I think most people believe.
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:29.500]   And testosterone is doing maybe different
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.140]   and fewer things in some cases and more in others.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.940]   I've known some aggressive females
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:38.480]   over the time I've been alive.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.260]   What's involved in female aggression
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.440]   that's unique from the pathways
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.900]   that generate male aggression?
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.700]   Great, great question.
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:49.160]   So we and other labs have studied this
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:52.500]   in both mice and also in fruit flies.
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.360]   So one thing in mice that distinguishes
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.140]   aggression in females from males
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:00.620]   is that male mice are pretty much ready to fight
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.240]   at the drop of a hat.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:07.240]   Female mice only fight when they are nurturing
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:11.800]   and nursing their pups after they've delivered a litter.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.660]   And there's a window there
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:16.580]   where they become hyper aggressive.
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:19.160]   And then after their pups are weaned,
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.700]   that aggressiveness goes away.
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.180]   So this is pretty remarkable
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.980]   that you take a virgin female mouse
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.600]   and expose it to a male.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.640]   And her response is to become sexually receptive
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.020]   and to mate with him.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.540]   And now you let her have her pups
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:37.500]   and you put the same male or another male mouse
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.540]   in the cage with her.
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:41.620]   And instead of trying to mate with him, she attacks him.
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.900]   So there is some presumably hormonal
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:48.100]   and also neuronal switch that's occurring
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.940]   in the brain that switches the response
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:55.060]   of the female from sex to aggression
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.640]   when she goes from virginity to maternity.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.740]   And we recently showed in a paper,
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:03.140]   this is work from one of my students, Mung Yew Liu,
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.580]   that within VMH in females,
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:09.940]   there are two clearly divisible subsets
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.660]   of estrogen receptor neurons.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:17.100]   And she showed that one of those subsets controls fighting
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:19.400]   and the other one controls mating.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:23.660]   And in fact, if you stimulate the fighting specific subset
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:27.160]   in a virgin, you can get the virgin to attack,
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:31.260]   which is something that we were never able to do before.
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.580]   And if you stimulate the mating one, you enhance mating.
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:37.060]   The reason we could never get these results
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:39.940]   when we stimulated the whole population
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.560]   of estrogen receptor neurons is that these effects
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.300]   are opposite and they cancel out.
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:49.100]   And so it turns out that if you measure the activity
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:53.020]   of the fighting and the mating neurons going from a virgin
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:58.020]   to a maternal female, the aggression neurons are very low
[00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:01.180]   in their activity in the virgin.
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:04.140]   But once the female has pups,
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:08.820]   the activation ability of those neurons goes way up
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.060]   and the mating neurons stay the same.
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:14.700]   So if you think of the balance between them like a seesaw
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:19.080]   in the virgin, there is more activity in the mating neurons
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.440]   than in the fighting neurons.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:24.340]   Whereas in the nursing mother, there's more activity
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:27.660]   or more activation in the other way around,
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.980]   the fighting neurons in the mating.
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:31.220]   Did I say fighting and mating in the first?
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.940]   Mating neurons dominate fighting in the virgin,
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:37.500]   fighting neurons dominate mating in the mother.
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:41.700]   So that's a really cool observation
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.220]   and it's not something that happens in males
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:48.460]   and we don't know what causes that or controls that.
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:53.460]   Interestingly, this gets into the whole issue of neurons
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:57.180]   that are present in females, but not in males.
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:00.560]   So we've known for, the field has known for a long time
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.740]   that male and female fruit flies have sex specific neurons.
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:07.380]   And most of the neurons that we've identified
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.420]   in fruit flies that control fighting in males
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.760]   are male specific.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.400]   They're not found in the female brain.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.220]   But recently we discovered a set
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:21.620]   of female specific fighting neurons in the female brain
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:24.620]   together with a couple of other laboratories.
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:28.900]   Now they do share one common population of neurons
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:32.660]   in both male and female flies that in females
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.500]   activates the female specific fighting neurons
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.900]   and in males activates the male specific fighting neurons.
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:42.720]   So it's kind of a hierarchy with this common neuron on top.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:46.560]   And in mice, we discovered that there are
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:50.940]   male specific neurons in VMH and those neurons
[00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:54.140]   are activated during male aggression.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:57.040]   Now the neurons that are active in females
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.020]   when females fight in VMH are not sex specific.
[00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.920]   So they are also found in males.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.420]   So this is already showing you some complexity.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:11.420]   The male mouse VMH has both male specific aggression neurons
[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.820]   and generic aggression neurons.
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:17.080]   And then the female VMH, the mating cells
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.740]   are only found in females.
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:22.340]   They are female specific and not found in the male brain.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.880]   And so we're trying to find out
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.300]   what these sex specific populations of neurons are doing.
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:30.780]   But that indicates that that is some of the mechanism
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:34.180]   by which different sexes show different behaviors.
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:38.400]   I'm fixated on this transition from the virgin female mouse
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.760]   to the maternal female mouse.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.500]   I have a couple of questions about whether or not,
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.260]   for instance, the transition is governed
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:46.460]   by the presence of pups.
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:48.080]   So for instance, if you take a virgin female,
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.260]   she'll mate with a male.
[00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:53.380]   Once she's had pups, she'll try and fight that male
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.280]   or presumably another intruder female, right?
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.060]   Equally towards females and male intruders.
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:00.980]   Does that require the presence of her pups?
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.420]   Meaning if you were to take those pups
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:03.980]   and give them to another mother,
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:06.700]   does she revert to the more virgin-like behavior?
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.180]   Is it related to, is it triggered by lactation
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.980]   or could it actually be triggered
[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:12.660]   by the mating behavior itself?
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:16.060]   'Cause it's possible for the virgin to become a non-virgin
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:18.260]   but not actually have a litter of pups.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.580]   Right, those are all great questions
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.820]   and we don't know the answer.
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:27.380]   Most of them, what I can say is that a nursing mother
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:30.640]   doesn't have to have her pups with her in the cage
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:35.420]   in order to attack an intruder male or an intruder female.
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:40.180]   She is just in a state of brain
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:43.420]   that makes her aggressive to any intruder.
[00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:47.200]   And those aggression neurons in that female's brain
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:51.860]   are activated by both male and female intruders equally.
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:54.920]   Whereas in male mice, the aggression neurons
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:59.140]   are only ever activated by males, not by females
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:02.380]   because males are never supposed to attack females.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:04.580]   They're only supposed to mate with them.
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:07.300]   So that's another difference in how those neurons
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:11.580]   are tuned to signals from different conspecifics.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:13.860]   Does it require lactation?
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.420]   I don't know the answer to that.
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.300]   I think there are some experiments
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:20.440]   where people have tried to, classical experiments,
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:24.540]   people have tried to reproduce the changes in hormones
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:28.040]   that occur during pregnancy in female rats
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.180]   to see if it can make them aggressive.
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:33.840]   And some of those manipulations do to some extent,
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:36.140]   but there's a whole biology there
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.300]   that remains to be explored
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:40.700]   about how much of this is hormones,
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:43.840]   how much of this is circuitry and electricity,
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:46.600]   and how much of it is other factors
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.680]   that we haven't identified yet.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.060]   I don't want to anthropomorphize,
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:52.880]   but well, I'll just ask the question.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:56.480]   So the other day I was watching ferrets mate, right?
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.620]   Mustelids, they're mustelids and they're mating behavior.
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.260]   I guess I didn't say why I was watching this.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.100]   Doesn't matter.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.940]   It simply doesn't matter.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.460]   But if one observes the mating behaviors
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.580]   of different animals,
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.320]   we know that there's a tremendous range
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.400]   of mating behaviors in humans.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.500]   There can be no aggressive component.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.580]   There could be aggressive component.
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:19.800]   Humans have all sorts of kinks and fetishes and behaviors
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.760]   and most of which probably has never been documented
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.700]   'cause most of this happens in private.
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.000]   And here I always say on this podcast,
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.520]   anytime we're talking about sexual behavior in humans,
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.780]   we're always making the presumption
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:31.320]   that it's consensual, age appropriate,
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.420]   context appropriate and species appropriate.
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.560]   Let's say we're talking about a lot of different species.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.960]   With that said, just to set context,
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.920]   I was watching this video of ferrets mating
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.540]   and it's quite violent actually.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.960]   There's a lot of neck biting.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.280]   There's a lot of squealing.
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.960]   If I were gonna project an anthropomorphize, I'd say,
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.880]   it's not really clear they both want to be there.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.880]   You would just, one would make that assumption.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.360]   And of course we don't know.
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:57.200]   We have no idea.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.640]   This could be the ritual.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.760]   It seems to me that there is some crossover
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.480]   of aggression and mating behavior circuitry
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.560]   during the act of mating.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.020]   And do you think that reflects this sort of
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:17.960]   stew of competing neurons that are prioritizing
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.160]   in real time?
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.480]   Because of course, as states, they have persistence,
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.320]   as you point out, and you can imagine that
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.280]   states overlapping in four different states,
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.780]   the motivational drive to mate,
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:30.360]   the motivational drive to get away from this experience,
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:34.720]   the motivational drive to eat at some point,
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:35.920]   to defecate at some point,
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.460]   all of these things are competing.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.320]   And what we're really seeing is a bias in probabilities.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.120]   But when you look at mating behavior of various animals,
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.800]   you see an aggressive component sometimes, but not always.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.320]   Is it species specific?
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.320]   Is it context specific?
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.140]   And more generally,
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.940]   do you think that there is crosstalk
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:57.120]   between these different neuronal populations
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.920]   and the animal itself might be kind of confused
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.000]   about what's going on.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.320]   - Right. Great, great questions.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.160]   I can't really speak to the issue
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.480]   of whether this is species specific
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.240]   'cause I'm not a naturalist or a zoologist.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.640]   I've seen like you have in the wild,
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.000]   for example, lions when they mate.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.160]   I've seen them in Africa.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.480]   There's often a biting component of that as well.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.620]   One of the things that surprised us
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:24.440]   when we identified neurons in VMHVL
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.240]   that control aggression in males
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.920]   is that within that population,
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:34.840]   there is a subset of neurons that is activated by females
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.380]   during male-female mating encounters.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:42.380]   Now, you don't generally think of mouse sex as rough sex,
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:48.040]   but there is a lot of what superficially
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.520]   looks like violent behavior sometimes,
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:54.960]   especially if the female rejects the male and runs away.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.420]   And there's some evidence
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:02.000]   that those female selective neurons in VMH
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.480]   are part of the mating behavior.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.360]   If you shut them down,
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.240]   the animals don't mate as effectively
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.280]   as they otherwise would.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.480]   What happens when you stimulate them?
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.660]   We don't yet know because we don't have a way
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.600]   to specifically do that
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.840]   without activating the male aggression neurons.
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:26.440]   But I think they must be there for a reason
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.440]   because VMH is not traditionally the brain region
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.140]   to which male sexual behavior has been assigned.
[01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:38.000]   That's another area called the medial preoptic area.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.100]   And there we have shown that there are neurons
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:44.120]   that definitely stimulate mating behavior.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.640]   In fact, if we activate those mating neurons in a male
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.780]   while it's in the middle of attacking another male,
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:54.400]   it will stop fighting, start singing to that male,
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.020]   and start to try to mount that male
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.900]   until we shut those neurons off.
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:02.280]   So those are the make-love-not-war neurons,
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.460]   and VMH are the make-war-not-love neurons.
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.160]   And there are dense interconnections
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.520]   between these two nuclei,
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.740]   which are very close to each other in the brain.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.360]   And we've shown that some of those connections
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.360]   are mutually inhibitory to prevent the animal
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.780]   from attacking a mate that it's supposed to be mating with,
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:28.520]   or to prevent it from mating with an animal
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.000]   it's supposed to be attacking.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.520]   But it's also possible that there are some cooperative
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.260]   interactions between those structures,
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:39.960]   as well as antagonistic interactions.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.880]   And the balance of whether it's the cooperative
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.120]   or antagonistic interactions that are firing
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.380]   at any given moment in a mating encounter, as you suggest,
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:55.380]   may determine whether a moment of coital bliss
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:02.120]   among two lions may suddenly turn into a snap or a growl
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.480]   and a bearing of fangs.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.840]   We don't know that, but certainly the substrate,
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.980]   the wiring is there for that to happen.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:14.100]   - I'm sure people's minds are running wild with all this.
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.800]   I'll just use this as an opportunity to raise something
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:19.880]   I've wondered about for far too long,
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.240]   which is I have a friend who's a psychiatrist
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.600]   who works on the treatment of fetishes.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.720]   This is not a psychiatrist that I was treated by.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.280]   I'll just point that out.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.160]   But they mentioned something very interesting to me
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.200]   long ago, which is that when you look at true fetishes
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.220]   and what meets the criteria for fetish,
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.840]   that there does seem to be some,
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.800]   what one would think would be competing circuitry
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.980]   that suddenly becomes aligned.
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:51.980]   For instance, avoidance of feces, dead bodies, feet,
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:55.160]   things that are very infectious,
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.880]   typically those states of disgust are antagonistic
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:03.880]   to states of desire as one would hope is present
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.760]   during sexual behavior.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.680]   Fetishes often involve exactly those things
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:14.680]   that are aversive, feet, dead bodies, disgusting things
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:20.040]   to most people and true fetishes in the pathologic sense
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:24.880]   exist when people have basically a requirement
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.520]   for thinking about or even the presence
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.560]   of those ordinarily disgusting things
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.460]   in order to become sexually aroused.
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.800]   As if the circuitry has crossed over
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.960]   and the statement that rung in my mind was
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.560]   people don't develop fetishes to mailboxes
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:44.280]   or to the color red or to random objects and things.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.260]   They develop fetishes to things that are highly infectious
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.200]   and counter reproductive, repetitive states.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.920]   So I find that interesting.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.880]   I don't know if you have any reflections on that
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.700]   as to why that might be.
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:58.020]   I'm tempted to ask whether or not you've ever observed
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:01.440]   fetish like behavior in mice, but I find it fascinating
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.940]   that you have this area of the brain
[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.880]   that's so highly conserved, the hypothalamus,
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.040]   which you have these dense populations intermixed
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:11.120]   and that the addition of a forebrain, especially in humans
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.800]   that can think and make decisions could in some ways
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.000]   facilitate the expression of these primitive behaviors,
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.180]   but could also complicate the expression
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.600]   of primitive behaviors.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.720]   - Right, I would agree.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.120]   I think one way of looking at fetishes
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.680]   from a neurobiological standpoint
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:33.680]   is that they represent a kind of a repetitive conditioning
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:39.240]   where something that is natively aversive or disgusting
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:44.440]   by being repeatedly paired with a rewarding experience
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:49.120]   changes its valence, its sign,
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:54.120]   so that now it somehow produces the anticipation of reward
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.840]   the next time a person sees it.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.340]   Now, I don't know how, I don't know that literature
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:04.760]   in animals, so I don't know if you could condition a mouse
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.500]   to eat feces, for example, although there are animals
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.320]   that are naturally coprophagic.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:14.680]   That is, and maybe mice do that occasionally, I'm not sure,
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.960]   but that is one way to think about it,
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.880]   and that could certainly involve in humans
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.360]   the more recently evolved parts of the brain,
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.360]   the cortex that is sort of orchestrating
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.920]   both what behaviors are happening
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.320]   and whether reward states are turning on
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:37.040]   in association with those behaviors that are happening.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.240]   And that's the part that I think is difficult
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:44.340]   and challenging to study in a mouse,
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:48.280]   but certainly bears thinking about
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.820]   because it's a really interesting,
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:53.760]   again, sort of counterintuitive aspect,
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.280]   again, like rough sex, people that want to have fighting
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.940]   or violence or aggressiveness
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:02.880]   in order to be sexually aroused and fetishes.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.800]   And in fact, when we made that discovery initially,
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.060]   it raised the question in my mind
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:13.060]   whether some people that are serial rapists, for example,
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:18.040]   and engage in sexual violence might in some level
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:21.200]   have their wires crossed in some way
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.680]   that these states that are supposed to be
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.520]   pretty much separated and mutually antagonistic are not
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.480]   and are actually more rewarding and reinforcing.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:33.860]   I think it's gonna be a long time
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:36.000]   before we have figured it out.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.800]   But when you think about it,
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:41.440]   there is no treatment that we have
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:46.440]   for a violent sexual offender that eliminates the violence,
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.600]   but not the sexual desire and sexual urge,
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:54.820]   whether it's physical castration or chemical castration,
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.280]   it eliminates both.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.180]   Definitely an area that I think,
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:03.440]   well, human neuroscience in general needs a lot of tools
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.800]   in terms of how to probe and manipulate neural circuitry.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.740]   I'd love to turn to this area that you mentioned,
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:12.020]   the medial preoptic area.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:15.040]   I'm fascinated by it because just as within the VMH,
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.140]   you have these neurons for mating and fighting or aggression.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:21.660]   My understanding is medial preoptic area
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:24.080]   contains neurons for mating,
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.360]   but also for temperature regulation.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.480]   And perhaps I'm making too much of a leap here,
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:30.980]   but I've always wondered about this phrase in heat.
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:37.000]   Certainly the menstrual or estrous cycle in females
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.880]   is related to changes in body temperature.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.560]   In fact, measuring body temperature is one way
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.840]   that women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.380]   Although this is not a show about contraception,
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.560]   please rely on multiple methods as necessary.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.300]   Don't use this discussion as your guide for contraception
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.360]   based on temperature.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:58.200]   But if you stimulate certain neurons
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.360]   in the medial preoptic area,
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.600]   you can trigger dramatic changes in body temperature
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:06.160]   and/or mating behavior.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.480]   What's the relationship, if any,
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.660]   between temperature and mating, or do we simply not know?
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:15.120]   I don't know what the relationship is
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:20.120]   between temperature and mating neurons in the preoptic area.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:25.320]   I suspect that they are different populations of neurons
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:29.800]   because it's become pretty clear that the preoptic area
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.540]   has many different subsets of neurons
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:36.160]   that are specifically active during different behaviors,
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.800]   even different phases of mating behavior.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.560]   So there are mounting neurons,
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.160]   there are intermission, thrusting neurons,
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:46.080]   and ejaculation neurons, and sniffing neurons.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.660]   - Wait, wait, so I think I've heard this before,
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.240]   but I just wanna make sure that people get this,
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.440]   and I wanna make sure I get this.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.540]   So you're telling me within medial preoptic area,
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.840]   there are specific neurons that if you stimulate them
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.800]   will make males thrust as if they're mating?
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.800]   - No, so this is not based on stimulation experiments.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.940]   It's based on imaging experiments right now
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.840]   that we see when we look in the preoptic area
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.140]   at what neurons are active
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:17.280]   during different phases of aggression,
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.280]   we see that there are different neurons
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.520]   that are active during sniffing, mounting,
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.920]   thrusting, and ejaculation,
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.040]   and they become repeatedly activated
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.280]   each time the animal goes through that cycle.
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:31.120]   - During mating.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.920]   - During the mating cycle.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.400]   There are also some neurons there
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.400]   that are active during aggression, which are distinct,
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.480]   and we don't know whether those neurons are there
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.660]   to promote aggression or to inhibit mating
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.240]   when animals are fighting.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:49.560]   We have some evidence that suggests it may be the latter,
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.440]   but we don't know for sure yet.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.240]   The thermosensitive neurons are really interesting
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.480]   because you mentioned the phrase in heat,
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.820]   and then in the context of aggression,
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:02.960]   you talk about hot-blooded people or hotheads.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.760]   There's just recently a paper showing
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.900]   there are thermoregulatory neurons in VMH as well.
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:11.800]   So all of these homeostatic systems
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.200]   for metabolic control and temperature control
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:18.600]   are intermingled in these nuclei,
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.900]   these zones that control these basic survival behaviors
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:26.900]   like mating and aggression and predator defense.
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:31.280]   And I would imagine that the thermoregulation
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:35.560]   is tightly connected to energy expenditure
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:39.180]   and that, again, these neurons are mixed together
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:43.080]   to facilitate integration of all these signals
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.640]   by the brain in some way that we don't understand
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.520]   to maintain the proper balance
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.520]   between energy conservation and energy consumption
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.800]   during this particular behavior or that behavior.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.960]   I mean, I've always been fascinated by the question,
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.020]   why is it that violence goes up in the summertime
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.840]   when the temperatures are high?
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:08.400]   Does it really have something to do with the idea
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:12.080]   that increased temperature increases violence?
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.360]   It seems hard to believe because we're homeothermic
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:20.360]   and we pretty much stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit.
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:23.640]   Could be other social reasons why that happens.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.600]   People are outside, out on the street,
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.080]   bumping into each other.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.280]   But I think there could well be something
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.020]   that ties thermoregulation to aggressiveness
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:38.200]   as well as to mating behavior.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.120]   - Fascinating, yeah.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.360]   I asked in the hopes that maybe in the years to come,
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.400]   your lab will parse some of the temperature relationships.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:49.320]   And I realized it could be also regulated
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.480]   by hormones in general.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.880]   So it's tapping into two systems
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.080]   for completely different reasons.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.000]   But anyway, an area that intrigues me
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.600]   because of this notion of hotheadedness
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.440]   or cool, common, collected.
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.880]   And also the fact that,
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.400]   I probably should have asked about this earlier,
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.240]   that arousal itself is tethered
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:09.640]   to the whole mating and reproductive process.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.040]   I mean, without a sort of seesawing back
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:16.080]   between the sympathetic and parasympathetic arousal,
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:19.520]   relaxed states, there is no mating that will take place.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:23.440]   So it's fascinating the way these different competing forces
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.760]   and seesaws operate.
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.920]   Several times during the discussion so far,
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:32.920]   we've hit on this idea that the same behavior
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.780]   can reflect different states
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.480]   and different states can converge
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.380]   on multiple behaviors as well.
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:42.420]   You had a paper not long ago about mounting behavior,
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:45.520]   which I found fascinating.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.760]   Maybe you could tell us about that result.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.800]   Because to me, it really speaks to the fact
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:53.880]   that mounting behavior can in one context be sexual
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:56.440]   and in another context actually be related to,
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.960]   we presume dominance.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.960]   And I think that my friends who practice jujitsu will say,
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.920]   when I talk about that result, they say, of course,
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.840]   mounting the other person and dominating them,
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.240]   there's nothing sexual about it.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.420]   It's about overtaking them physically,
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:14.360]   literally being on their next side
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:18.400]   as opposed to on their own, lying on their own back.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.100]   Just fascinating, very primitive.
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:23.100]   And yet I think speaks to this idea
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.920]   that mounting behavior might be one
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.720]   of the most fundamental ways in which animals
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.880]   and perhaps even humans express dominance
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:34.060]   and/or sexual interactions.
[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:37.540]   Yep, that's a fascinating question.
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.880]   And it was harder to figure out
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:41.240]   than you might've thought.
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:44.700]   So there's been this debate for a long time in the field
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:48.740]   when you see two male mice mounting each other.
[01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:50.900]   Is this homosexual behavior?
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:54.320]   Is this a case of mistaken sexual identification
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.440]   or is this dominance behavior?
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.560]   And if you train an AI algorithm
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:03.820]   to try to distinguish male-male mounting
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:07.160]   from male-female mounting, it does not do a very good job
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.480]   because motorically those behaviors look so similar.
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.360]   And so how did we wind up figuring out
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:20.940]   that most male-male mounting is dominance mounting?
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:23.940]   There are two important clues.
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:26.860]   One is the context.
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:31.260]   And so male-male mounting tends to be more prominent
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:33.820]   among mice when they haven't had a lot
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:35.620]   of fighting experience.
[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:40.460]   And then as they become more experienced in fighting,
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.780]   they will show relatively less mounting
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:46.120]   towards the other male and more attack.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:50.180]   And they'll transition quickly from mounting to attack.
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:54.620]   And so the mounting is always seen in this context
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:58.060]   of an overall aggressive interaction.
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.280]   And then the second thing, which believe it or not,
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:04.820]   was suggested by a computational theoretical person
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.900]   in my lab, Anne Kennedy,
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:09.180]   who now has her own lab at Northwestern.
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:12.540]   She said, well, males are known to sing
[01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:15.640]   when they mount females, ultrasonic vocalizations.
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:19.020]   Why don't you see what kinds of songs they're singing
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.320]   when they're mounting males?
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.820]   Maybe it's a different kind of song.
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:25.100]   Well, what we found out is they don't sing at all
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.880]   when they're mounting a male.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:31.880]   So you can easily distinguish whether mounting behavior
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:36.880]   by a male mouse is reproductive or agonistic, aggressive,
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:40.180]   according to whether it's accompanied
[01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:43.580]   by ultrasonic vocalizations or not.
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:47.080]   And it turns out that different brain regions
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:50.520]   are maximally active during these different types
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:51.360]   of mounting.
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:55.120]   So VMH, the aggression locus,
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.380]   is actually active during dominance mounting.
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:02.340]   And you can stimulate mounting if you, dominance mounting,
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:05.440]   if you weakly activate VMH.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.860]   Whereas MPOA is most strongly activated
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:10.820]   during sexual mounting.
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:14.700]   And that's always accompanied by the ultrasonic vocalization.
[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:18.540]   So this shows how difficult and dangerous it can be
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:23.400]   to try to infer an animal state or intent or emotion
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.900]   from the behavior that it's exhibiting,
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:29.140]   because the same behavior can mean very different things
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:32.180]   depending on the context or the interaction with the animal.
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.980]   And I would say even more so with when that animal
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:37.660]   is a human or is multiple humans.
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:38.500]   That's right.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.460]   And there are many examples.
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:44.420]   Animals show chasing to obtain food,
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:47.100]   a prey animal that they're gonna kill and eat.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.840]   And they show chasing to obtain a mate
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.620]   that they're gonna have sex with.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:55.540]   And so the intent of the chasing is completely different.
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.420]   And we don't know in all these cases,
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:00.580]   whether there are separate circuits or common circuits
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:01.820]   that are being activated.
[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:06.140]   I'm obsessed with dogs and dog breeds and et cetera, et cetera.
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:10.580]   And one thing I can tell you is that female dogs
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:12.780]   will mount and thrust.
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:17.040]   We had a female pit bull mix, a very sweet dog,
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.660]   but in observing her, it convinced me
[01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:23.880]   that one can never assume that male dogs
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:25.680]   are more aggressive than female dogs.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.760]   There's a, it turns out in talking to people
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.280]   who are quite skilled at dog genetics and dog breeding,
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:33.900]   that there is a dominance hierarchy within a litter
[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:38.900]   and it crosses over male/female delineations.
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:40.840]   So you can get a female in the litter
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.180]   that's very dominant, a male that's very subordinate.
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:45.860]   And no one really knows what relates to.
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:47.460]   This is also why little dogs sometimes
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:50.580]   will get right up in the face of a big Doberman Pinscher
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.420]   and just start barking,
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.080]   which is an idiotic thing for it to do,
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.300]   but they can be dominant over a much larger dog.
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.560]   Very strange to me anyway.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.820]   Female/female mounting.
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:02.160]   Do you observe it in mice?
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:04.660]   Are there known circuits
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:07.260]   and what evokes female/female mounting
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:10.460]   or female to male mounting if it occurs?
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:11.280]   Good.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.520]   Yes, there is females.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.460]   There are clear examples of females
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:19.060]   displaying male type mounting behavior
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:20.580]   towards other females.
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.940]   We see this most commonly in the lab
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:27.420]   where we are housing females with their sisters,
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.580]   say three or four in a cage.
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:33.500]   We take one out and we have her mate with a male
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.260]   where the male's doing the mounting.
[01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:39.020]   Now we take that female and we put her back in the cage
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:42.840]   with her litter mates and she starts mounting them.
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:45.980]   Now what the function of that is,
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:50.300]   if it has any function or what it means, what's driving it,
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:51.180]   we don't know.
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:54.220]   But we do know that if we stimulate
[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:58.280]   the neurons that control mounting in males
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.800]   in the medial preoptic area,
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:03.760]   if we stimulate that same population in females,
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:07.180]   it evokes male type mounting
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:09.700]   towards either a male or a female target.
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:13.960]   In fact, we have a movie where we have a female
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:16.560]   that has just been mounted by a male.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:19.640]   So the male's on top and she's underneath
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:24.060]   and we stimulate that region of MPOA in the female
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:27.420]   and she crawls out from underneath the male
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:31.560]   who has just mounted her, circles around behind him
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.420]   and climbs up on top of him
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:36.560]   and starts to try to mount him and thrust at him.
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:39.020]   That has a name on line, it's called a switch.
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.700]   Is that right?
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:41.800]   Don't ask me how I know that.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:42.880]   Okay.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:47.060]   But it's a pretty, yeah, it's a term that you hear.
[01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:50.680]   You also hear the term topping from the bottom,
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.480]   which it sounds like that is a literal topping
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.320]   from the bottom. I see.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.800]   That's a more of a psychological phrase from what I hear.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.960]   I have friends that are educating me in this language,
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.040]   mostly because I find this kind
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:06.060]   of neurobiological discussion fascinating at some point.
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:09.960]   I attempt in my mind to superimpose observations
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.920]   from the online communities that I've been told about
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:15.600]   and asked about to this, but I should point out,
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:17.800]   it's always dangerous and in fact,
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:20.760]   inappropriate to make a one-to-one link.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:23.640]   Humans are, they maintain all the same neural circuitry
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:26.040]   and pathways that we're talking about today in mice,
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:30.240]   but that forebrain does allow for context, et cetera.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.080]   Yep.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:36.080]   So what the function is of female mounting, I don't know,
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:39.600]   it could be a type of dominance display.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:42.420]   It's hard to measure that because people haven't worked
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:46.120]   on female dominance hierarchies to the same extent
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:49.100]   that they've worked on male dominance hierarchies,
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:54.100]   but it indicates that the circuits for male type mounting
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:56.920]   are there in females as early work
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:00.220]   from Catherine Dulock suggested some years ago.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:01.740]   Fascinating, fascinating.
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:04.980]   I love that paper because as you pointed out for Chase,
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:08.660]   for mounting behavior, we see it
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:11.440]   and we think one thing specifically.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:12.820]   And after hearing this result,
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:14.940]   actually I'm not a big fan of fight sports.
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.880]   I watch them occasionally 'cause friends are into them,
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:21.320]   but I've seen boxing matches, MMA matches,
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.140]   where at the end of a round,
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:25.120]   if someone felt that they dominated,
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:29.240]   they will do the unsportsmanlike thing of thrusting
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.880]   on the back of the other person before they get off,
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.020]   almost like I dominated you.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:35.080]   So mimicking sexual-like behavior,
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.360]   but there's no reason to think that it's sexual,
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.320]   but they're sending a message of dominance is what implies.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:45.520]   I'd love to talk about something slightly off
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.620]   from this circuitry, but I think that's related
[01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:49.300]   to the circuitry, at least in some way,
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:52.560]   which is this structure that I've always been fascinated by
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:54.940]   and I can't figure out what the hell it's for
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:56.100]   'cause it seems to be involved in everything,
[01:24:56.100 --> 01:25:00.340]   which is the PAG, the periaqueductal gray,
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:01.800]   which is a little bit further back in the brain
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:03.380]   for people that don't know.
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:05.040]   It's been studied in the context of pain.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.600]   It's been studied in the context
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.140]   of the so-called lordosis response,
[01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:10.960]   the receptivity or arching of the back of the female
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.560]   to receive intromission and mating from the male.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.460]   How should we think about PAG?
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:19.600]   Clearly, it can't be involved in everything.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.640]   I'm guessing it's at least as complex
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.640]   as some of these other regions
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.580]   that we've been talking about,
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.400]   different types of neurons controlling different things,
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.860]   but how does PAG play into this?
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:29.960]   In particular, I want to know,
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.560]   is there some mechanism of pain modulation
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:37.400]   and control during fighting and/or mating?
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.600]   And the reason I ask is that,
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.240]   while I'm not a combat sports person,
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.560]   years ago, I did a little bit of martial arts,
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.800]   and it always was impressive to me
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.320]   how little it hurt to get punched during a fight
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.920]   and how much it hurt afterwards, right?
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:54.440]   So there clearly is some endogenous pain control
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.760]   that then wears off and then you feel beat up.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.760]   Or at least in my case, I felt beat up.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.220]   What's PAG doing vis-a-vis pain and vis-a-vis,
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:06.240]   and what's pain doing vis-a-vis these other behaviors?
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:07.080]   - Good, good.
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:12.080]   So I think of PAG like a old-fashioned type
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:14.000]   in telephone switchboard,
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.480]   where there are calls coming in,
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.860]   and then the cables have to be punched into the right hole
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:24.820]   to get the information to be routed to the right recipient
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:26.520]   on the other end of it,
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:30.640]   because pretty much every type of innate behavior
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.400]   you can think of has had the PAG implicated.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:37.520]   There's a whole literature showing the involvement
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:41.700]   of the PAG in fear, different regions of the PAG,
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:45.360]   the dorsal PAG is involved in panic-like behavior,
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:46.400]   running away.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.880]   The ventral PAG is involved in freezing behavior.
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:55.940]   Both the MPOA and VMH send projections to the PAG
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:58.920]   to different regions of the PAG.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.800]   So in cross-section, I hate to say this,
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.200]   but in cross-section,
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.940]   the PAG kind of looks like the water in a toilet
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:10.000]   when you're standing over an open toilet bowl.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.000]   And if you imagine a clock face projected onto that,
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.960]   it's like the PAG has sectors from one to 12,
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.300]   maybe even more of them.
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:22.920]   And in each of those sectors,
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:25.740]   you find different neurons from the hypothalamus
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:26.880]   are projecting.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:31.220]   So could turn out that there is a topographic arrangement
[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:34.240]   along the dorsal ventral axis of the PAG
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.040]   and the medial lateral axis of the PAG
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.860]   that determines the type of behavior
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:41.400]   that will be emitted
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:44.000]   when neurons in that region are stimulated.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.060]   And I think sort of all of the evidence
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.840]   is pointing in that direction,
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.560]   but by no means has it been mapped out.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.040]   Now, the thing that you mentioned about it not hurting
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:56.920]   when you got beat up during martial arts,
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.240]   there is a well-known phenomenon
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:03.800]   called fear-induced analgesia,
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:08.760]   where when an animal is in a high state of fear,
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.220]   like if it's trying to defend itself,
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:16.220]   there is a suppression of pain responses.
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:20.660]   And I'm not sure completely about the mechanisms
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.720]   and how well that's understood.
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:27.720]   But for example, the adrenal gland has a peptide in it
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:32.220]   that is released from the adrenal medulla,
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.880]   which controls the fight or flight responses.
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:38.920]   And that peptide has analgesic activities.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:40.000]   Now whether- Ask what that peptide is.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.320]   It's called bovine adrenal medullary peptide
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.480]   of 22 amino acid residues.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:49.520]   And I only know about it because it activates a receptor
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:53.200]   that we discovered many years ago that's involved in pain.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.800]   And we thought it promoted pain,
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.680]   but it turns out that this actually inhibits pain.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:00.480]   It's like an endogenous analgesic.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.360]   Whether this is happening, this type of analgesia
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:08.100]   is happening when an animal is engaged
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:13.100]   in offensive aggression or in mating behavior,
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:16.400]   I don't know, but it certainly is possible.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:20.480]   And I don't know whether these analgesic mechanisms
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.480]   are happening in the PAG.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:25.560]   They could also be happening a little further down
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.600]   in the spinal cord.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:30.000]   The PAG is really continuous with the spinal cord.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.900]   If you just follow it down towards the tail of an animal,
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:36.700]   you will wind up in the spinal cord.
[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:40.600]   And so it could be that there are influences
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:44.040]   acting at many levels on pain in the PAG
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.360]   and in the spinal cord as well.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:49.080]   And it may well be known, I just don't know it.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.780]   I wanna distinguish clearly between things
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:55.100]   that are not known, that I know are unknown,
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:58.780]   which is in a fairly small area where I have expertise
[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:01.820]   from things that may be known, but I'm ignorant of them
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:04.300]   because I just don't have a broad enough knowledge base
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:05.140]   to know that.
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:08.220]   - Sure, we appreciate those delineations.
[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:10.100]   Thank you.
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:11.740]   My PAG is, I think this description of it
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:14.100]   is an old fashioned telephone switchboard.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:16.420]   And now every time I look into the toilet,
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:18.140]   I'll think about the periaqueductal gray.
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:20.260]   And every time I see an image of periaqueductal gray,
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:21.260]   I think about a toilet.
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:24.540]   That is an excellent description because in fact,
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:27.640]   I drew a circle with a little thing at the bottom.
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:30.300]   Well, I'll put a post or a link to a picture of PAG
[01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.220]   and you'll understand why David and I are chuckling here
[01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:35.420]   because indeed it looks like a toilet
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:36.820]   when staring into a toilet.
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:40.360]   Tell us about tachykinin.
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.700]   I've talked about this a couple of times
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:42.940]   on different podcast episodes
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:47.420]   because of its relationship to social isolation.
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:51.100]   And in part, because the podcast was launched
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:53.700]   during a time when there was more social isolation.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:56.820]   My understanding is that tachykinin,
[01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:59.360]   and you'll tell us what it is in a moment,
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.820]   is present in flies and mice and in humans
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:05.860]   and may do similar things in those species.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:06.700]   That's right.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:11.020]   So tachykinin is, refers to a family
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.980]   of related neuropeptides.
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:15.180]   So these are brain chemicals.
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:19.420]   They're different from dopamine and serotonin
[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:23.080]   in that they're not small organic molecules.
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:25.860]   They're actually short pieces of protein
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:28.760]   that are directly encoded by genes
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:32.300]   that are active in specific neurons and not in others.
[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:34.100]   And when those neurons are active,
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:36.900]   those neuropeptides are released together
[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:40.560]   with classical transmitters like glutamate, whatever.
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:45.540]   Tachykinins have been famously implicated in pain,
[01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:50.400]   particularly tachykinin one, which is called substance P,
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:53.340]   one of the original pain modulating.
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:57.480]   This is something that promotes inflammatory pain,
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:00.020]   but there are other tachykinin genes.
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:03.980]   In mice, there are two, in humans, I think there are three,
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:06.700]   and in Drosophila, there's one.
[01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:09.260]   And the way we got into tachykinins
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:12.540]   is from studying aggression in flies.
[01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:17.300]   We thought since neuropeptides have this remarkable
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:22.060]   parallel evolutionary conservation of structure and function
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:26.360]   like neuropeptide Y controls feeding in worms,
[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:28.980]   in flies and mice and in people.
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:32.200]   Oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:35.580]   in worms and mice and in people.
[01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:39.260]   We thought we might find peptides that control aggression
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:40.660]   in flies and in people.
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:44.720]   And so we did a screen, unbiased screen of peptides
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:48.660]   and found indeed that one of the tachykinins,
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:51.580]   Drosophila tachykinin, those neurons,
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.780]   when you activate them strongly promote aggression
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:57.540]   and it depends on the release of tachykinin.
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:00.580]   Now, the interesting thing is that in flies,
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:05.440]   just like in people and practically any other social animal
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:06.940]   that shows aggression,
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:10.420]   social isolation increases aggressiveness.
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:14.940]   So putting a violent prisoner in solitary confinement
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:17.760]   is absolutely the worst, most counterproductive thing
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.060]   you could do to them.
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:23.060]   And indeed we found in flies that social isolation
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:26.900]   increases the level of tachykinin in the brain.
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:29.160]   And if we shut that gene down,
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:32.640]   it prevents the isolation from increasing aggression.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:35.660]   So since my lab also works on mice,
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:38.960]   it was natural to see whether tachykinins
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:42.260]   might be upregulated in social isolation
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:44.500]   and whether they play a role in aggression.
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.860]   And this is work done by a former postdoc,
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:50.120]   Marielle Zelikovsky, now at University of Salt Lake City
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.980]   in Utah, and she found remarkably
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:56.860]   that when mice are socially isolated for two weeks,
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:00.220]   there is this massive upregulation
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:03.420]   of tachykinin-2 in their brain.
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:06.300]   In fact, if you tag the peptide
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:08.880]   with a green fluorescent protein
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:10.780]   from a jellyfish genetically,
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:14.940]   the brain looks green when the mice are socially isolated
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:17.740]   'cause there's so much of this stuff released.
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:22.740]   And she went on to show that that increase in tachykinin
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:27.820]   is responsible for the effect of social isolation
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:31.620]   to increase aggressiveness and to increase fear
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.260]   and to increase anxiety.
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:36.860]   And in fact, there are drugs that block the receptor
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:41.180]   for tachykinin, which were tested in humans and abandoned
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:43.820]   because they had no efficacy in the tests
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:45.600]   that they were analyzed for.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:49.740]   If you give those drugs to a socially isolated mouse,
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:53.420]   it blocks all of the effects of social isolation.
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:57.480]   It blocks the aggression, it blocks the increased fear
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:58.920]   and the increased anxiety.
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:02.540]   And that Marielle described it, the mice just look chill.
[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:05.260]   It's not a sedative, which is really important.
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:08.240]   It's not that the mice are going to sleep.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:13.220]   Most remarkably is once you socially isolate a mouse
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:16.500]   and it becomes aggressive, you can never put it back
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:19.660]   in its cage with its brothers from its litter
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:22.100]   because it will kill them all overnight.
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:25.940]   But if you give it this drug, which is called Osanatant
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:30.940]   that blocks tachykinin too, that mouse can be returned
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:34.700]   to the cage with its brothers and will not attack them
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:38.700]   and seems to be happy about that for the rest of the time.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:42.540]   So this is an incredibly powerful effect of this drug.
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:46.220]   And I've been really interested in trying to get
[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:49.300]   pharmaceutical companies to test this drug,
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:52.980]   which has a really good safety profile in humans
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:56.380]   in testing it in people who are subjected
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:00.620]   to social isolation stress or bereavement stress.
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:05.120]   And this is one of the areas where I learned
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:08.380]   an eye-opening lesson as a basic scientist
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:11.340]   who naively thought that if you make a discovery
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:15.220]   and it has translational applications to humans
[01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:17.740]   that pharmaceutical companies are gonna be falling
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:20.020]   all over themselves to try it.
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:25.020]   And they're not interested because once burned, twice shy.
[01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:30.260]   These drugs were tested for efficacy and schizophrenia.
[01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:32.260]   I have no idea why.
[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:35.360]   There's very little preclinical data to suggest that.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.980]   Not surprisingly, they failed.
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:42.500]   When a drug fails in clinical trials in phase three,
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:46.500]   it costs $100 million to the company
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.340]   that carried out that clinical trial.
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:54.140]   So there's a huge slag heap of discarded pharmaceuticals,
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:58.340]   many of them inhibitors of neuropeptide action
[01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:02.260]   that could be useful in other indications
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:04.140]   such as the one we discovered.
[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:07.540]   But there's a huge economic disincentive
[01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:11.880]   for pharmaceutical companies to test them again
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:14.340]   because the conclusion that they drew
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:16.180]   from all these failed tests,
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:20.260]   particularly in the 2010s and before that,
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:22.780]   is that the reason they failed
[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:26.580]   is because animal experiments with drugs
[01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:31.200]   don't predict how humans will respond to the drugs.
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:35.120]   And therefore, we shouldn't try to extrapolate
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.760]   from any other data that we get from animal experiments,
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.880]   mouse or rat experiments, to humans
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.560]   because they'll lead us down the wrong track.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:46.000]   And I think that that is probably wrong.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.240]   In some cases, it may be right,
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.200]   but in other cases, there's good reason to think
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.060]   because these brain regions and molecules
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.760]   are so evolutionarily conserved
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.540]   that they ought to be playing a similar role in humans.
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:04.300]   In fact, there is a paper showing
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:09.300]   that in humans that have borderline personality disorder,
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.500]   there's a strong correlation
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:15.540]   between their self-reported level of aggressiveness
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:18.660]   and serum levels of a tachykinin,
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:20.700]   in this case, tachykinin-1,
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:22.900]   as detected by radioimmunoassay.
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:25.140]   This is work of Emil Coccaro,
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:28.660]   who's a clinical psychiatrist at the University of Chicago.
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:33.260]   So there is a smoking gun in the case of humans as well.
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:36.260]   And I was actually trying
[01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:38.820]   to interest a pharmaceutical company
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:41.740]   that was testing these drugs
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:46.740]   actually for treatment of hot flashes in females, in humans,
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:49.900]   where there is actually good animal data
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:51.980]   to think that it might be useful.
[01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:55.140]   But I realized that this clinical trial
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:58.700]   was going on during the COVID pandemic.
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:38:59.920]   And I approached him and said,
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.860]   "Look, nature may have actually done for you
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:05.020]   the experiment that I want you to do
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:08.160]   'cause some of the people who are getting drug or placebo
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.620]   are gonna have been socially isolated
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.140]   and some of them will have not.
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:14.780]   Why don't you get them to fill out questionnaires
[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:17.380]   and see whether the ones who were given the drug
[01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:21.540]   and socially isolated felt less stressed and less anxious
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:23.900]   than the ones who were not socially isolated
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:26.180]   and they would not touch it
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:29.300]   because they're in the middle of a clinical trial
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.820]   for a different indication for this drug
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:35.220]   and they have to report any observation
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:38.980]   that they make about that drug in their patient population.
[01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:41.460]   So if they were to ask these questions
[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.960]   and get an unfavorable answer,
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.740]   "Oh my God, I felt even worse when I took this drug
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:47.980]   and I was isolated,"
[01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:51.220]   they would be obliged to report that to the FDA
[01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:53.200]   and that could torpedo the chances
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:54.860]   for the drug being approved
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:56.920]   in the thing that it was in clinical trials for.
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:01.700]   So it's better not to ask and not to know
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:05.200]   than it is to try to find out more information
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:07.820]   that could lead to another clinical indication.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:12.700]   So I remain convinced that this family of drugs
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:17.140]   could have very powerful uses in treating some forms
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:21.280]   of stress-induced anxiety or aggressiveness in humans,
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.460]   but it's just very difficult for economic reasons
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:26.980]   to find a way to get somebody to test that.
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:30.500]   Yeah, a true shame that these companies won't do this
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:34.180]   and especially given the fact that many of these drugs exist
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:36.900]   and their safety profiles are established
[01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:39.540]   'cause that's always a serious consideration
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:41.780]   when embarking on a clinical trial.
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:44.460]   Perhaps in hearing this discussion,
[01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:47.640]   someone out there will understand the key importance of this
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:49.620]   and will reach out to us,
[01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:52.300]   will provide ways to do that
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:55.140]   to get such a study going in humans.
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:57.520]   Because I think if enough laboratories
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.820]   ran small-scale clinical trials,
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:02.060]   pharma certainly would perk up their ears, right?
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:05.660]   I mean, they're so strategic sometimes to their own.
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:07.540]   I mean, I would like to say also,
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:10.340]   I'd like to see this tested on pets.
[01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:13.060]   I mean, there's a huge number of pets right now
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:15.660]   that are suffering separation anxiety
[01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:18.540]   because humans bought them to keep them company
[01:41:18.540 --> 01:41:19.900]   during the COVID pandemic.
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:20.720]   And now they're home alone.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.340]   And now they're home alone, okay?
[01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:24.540]   And if this thing works in mice,
[01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:26.380]   there's certainly a higher chance
[01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.980]   it's gonna work in dogs or in cats
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:30.780]   than it is gonna work in humans.
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:33.740]   And if it did, that would be even more encouragement
[01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:35.660]   to continue along those lines.
[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:39.180]   People sometimes forget that although we work on animals
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:41.500]   and we ultimately wanna understand humans,
[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:44.220]   we care about how our results apply
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:46.740]   to the welfare of animals as well,
[01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:48.780]   and particularly domestic pets,
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:51.980]   which is a billion, multi-billion dollar industry
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:52.900]   in this country.
[01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:56.300]   So if there's ways that they can be made to feel better
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:59.500]   when they're separated from their owners,
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:01.280]   that would certainly be a good thing.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.760]   - Absolutely.
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:03.800]   We will put out the call.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:05.020]   We are putting out the call.
[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:08.320]   And I know for sure there will be a response.
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:13.420]   Just underscoring what we've been talking about even more,
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:16.700]   every time we hear about a school shooting,
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:18.060]   like in Texas recently,
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:19.660]   or I happened to be in New York
[01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:22.060]   during the time when there was a subway shooting,
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:28.020]   for whatever reason, I listened to the book about Columbine
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:30.020]   that went into a very detailed way
[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:33.260]   about the origin of those boys and that committed that.
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:38.260]   And every single time the person who commits those acts
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:41.460]   is socially isolated, as far as I know.
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:43.000]   There might be some exceptions there.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.300]   And sometimes this crosses over
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:45.460]   with other mental health issues,
[01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:48.180]   but sometimes no, no apparent mental health issues.
[01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:52.420]   So social isolation clearly drives powerful neurochemical
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:54.340]   and neurobiological changes.
[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:57.060]   I really hope that tachykinin one and two,
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:58.880]   those are the main ones in humans,
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:01.460]   will be explored in more detail.
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:03.900]   Also, I didn't know that tachykinin one is substance P
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:05.900]   and substance P is tachykinin one.
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:08.060]   - Tachykinin one is the gene name
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:12.300]   and tachykinin two in humans is called neurokinin B.
[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:14.220]   That's the name of the protein.
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:16.160]   I just referred to it by the gene name
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:17.320]   'cause it makes it easier.
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:18.820]   And I don't have to keep remembering
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:20.340]   two names for each thing.
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:24.260]   And I, if I'm not mistaken, you put yourself
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:25.580]   in the company of geneticists
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:26.860]   because of your original training
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:29.940]   was in genetics, immunology, and areas related to that.
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:31.580]   - It was in cell biology.
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:34.700]   And I didn't actually have formal training in genetics
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:38.180]   as a graduate student, but I think I'm a geneticist at heart.
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:41.300]   That's just the way I like to think about things.
[01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:43.400]   And when I started working on flies,
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.020]   that sort of, I came out of the closet
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:48.220]   as a geneticist, as it were.
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:49.660]   - Wonderful.
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:50.880]   As long as we're talking about humans,
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:51.780]   I'd love to get your thoughts
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:53.200]   about human studies of emotion.
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:55.140]   I know you wrote this book with Ralph Adol.
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:57.380]   So you have this new book, which we'll provide a link to,
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:43:59.840]   which I've read front to back twice.
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:01.020]   It's phenomenal.
[01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:02.460]   I mentioned it before on the podcast.
[01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:05.140]   It's really, there are books that are worth reading
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.620]   and then there are books that are important.
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.220]   And I think this book is truly important
[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:10.800]   for the general population to read and understand.
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:13.220]   And neuroscientists should read and understand the contents
[01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:17.980]   because we, as a culture, are way off
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:19.500]   in terms of how we think about emotions
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.340]   and states and behaviors.
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:22.460]   So we'll put a link to that.
[01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:25.880]   It's really worth the time and energy to read it.
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.520]   And it's written beautifully, I should say.
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:30.280]   Very accessible, even for non-scientists.
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:35.280]   There's a heat map diagram in that book that I think about.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:38.660]   This is a heat map diagram of subjective reports
[01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:43.660]   that people gave of where they experience an emotion
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:46.540]   or a feeling, somatic feeling in their body
[01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:51.100]   or in their head, or both when they are angry, sad, calm,
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:53.780]   lonely, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:56.480]   And I wouldn't want people to think that those heat maps
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:00.860]   were generated by any physiological measurement
[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:01.840]   because they were not.
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:04.860]   And yet, I don't think we can have a discussion
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:08.320]   about emotions and states and the sorts of behaviors
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:09.160]   that we're talking about today
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:11.700]   without thinking about the body also.
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:12.820]   And I'm not coming to this
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:14.900]   as a Northern California mind body.
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:16.220]   I've been to Esalen once.
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:17.420]   I didn't go in the baths.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:18.940]   I went there, I gave a talk and I left.
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:20.460]   It is very beautiful.
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:21.620]   If anyone wants to know what it looks like,
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:24.660]   I think that final scene of "Mad Men" is shot at Esalen.
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:26.620]   It's a very beautiful place.
[01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:31.620]   And yet, mind body to me is a neurobiological construct
[01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:33.180]   because the nervous system extends
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:35.100]   through the out of the cranial vault
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:37.340]   and into the spinal cord and body and back and forth.
[01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:38.500]   Okay.
[01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:43.460]   How should we think about the body in terms of states?
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:45.760]   And at some point, I'd love for you to comment
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:47.580]   on that heat map experiment
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:50.280]   because it does seem that there's some regularity
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:52.860]   as to where people experience emotions.
[01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:54.580]   When people are in a rage, for instance,
[01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:58.080]   they seem to feel it both in their gut and in their head,
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:00.560]   it seems, on average.
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:05.280]   And people love to extrapolate to gut intuition
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:08.720]   or that the chakras or anger is in the stomach
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:11.780]   and this goes to Eastern medicine, et cetera.
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:14.980]   How should we think about mind body in the context of states
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:16.760]   and think about it as scientists,
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:20.040]   maybe even as neuroscientists or geneticists?
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.120]   Good.
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:25.120]   So for the answer to the first question about the heat maps
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:28.420]   and people associating certain parts of their body
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:30.840]   with certain emotional feelings,
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:33.400]   this goes back to something called
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.620]   the somatic marker hypothesis
[01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:38.280]   that was proposed by Antonio Damasio,
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:41.360]   who is a neurologist at USC.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:45.480]   The idea that our subjective feeling
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:50.480]   of a particular emotion is in part associated
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:55.160]   with a sensation of something happening
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:59.840]   in a particular part of our body, the gut, the heart.
[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.720]   I don't see the liver invoked very much
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:06.700]   in emotional characterization.
[01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:08.420]   But gall and the gallbladder?
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:09.360]   Yes.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:10.200]   Somebody having a lot of gall.
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:11.040]   That's right.
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:12.100]   I'll make a fist when I say that,
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:14.120]   but I'm guessing the gallbladder is shaped like a fist.
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:15.640]   That's right.
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:20.260]   And if there is a physiology underlying these heat maps,
[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:22.840]   it could reflect increased blood flow
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:24.360]   to these different structures.
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:28.040]   And that in turn reflects what you were talking about.
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:31.800]   That is emotion is definitely involves communication
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:33.920]   between the brain and the body
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:36.880]   and it's bi-directional communication.
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:41.280]   And it's mediated by the peripheral nervous system,
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:44.520]   the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system,
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:47.480]   which control heart rate, for example,
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:50.240]   blood vessel, blood pressure.
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:54.720]   And those neurons receive input from the hypothalamus
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:58.380]   and other blood brain regions, central brain regions
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:00.380]   that control their activity.
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:05.040]   And when the brain is put in a particular state,
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:09.000]   it activates sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons,
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.800]   which have effects on the heart and on blood pressure.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:18.140]   And these in turn feed back onto the brain
[01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:20.040]   through the sensory system.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:23.860]   And a large part of this bi-directional communication
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:27.220]   is also mediated through the vagus nerve,
[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:30.840]   which many of your listeners and viewers
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:33.800]   may have heard about because it's become a topic
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.680]   of intense activity now.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:38.360]   People have known for a long time.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:43.360]   So the vagus nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:47.280]   that comes out basically of your skull,
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:51.920]   out of the central nervous system and then sends fibers
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:56.920]   in to your heart, your gut, all sorts of visceral organs.
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:00.960]   So when you have, and that information
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.760]   is both used the words earlier in our discussion,
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:06.960]   afferent and efferent.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:11.720]   So the vagal fibers sense things
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.860]   that are happening in the body.
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:16.920]   So when you're, the reason you feel your stomach
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:19.560]   tied up in knots, if you're tense,
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:22.960]   is that those vagal fibers are sensing
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:25.900]   the contraction of the gut muscles.
[01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:27.780]   And they're also afferents,
[01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:31.140]   which means that information coming out of the brain
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:34.800]   can influence those peripheral organs as well.
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:37.120]   And there's work from a number of labs
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:40.380]   just in the last six months or so
[01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:44.840]   where people are starting to decode the components
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:48.240]   of the different fibers in the vagus nerve.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:51.240]   And it's amazing how much specificity is.
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:55.360]   There are specific vagal nerves that go to the lung,
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:59.600]   that control breathing responses, that go to the gut,
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:01.620]   that go to other organs.
[01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:06.260]   It's almost like a set of color-coded lines,
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:08.120]   labeled lines for those things.
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:13.120]   And now how those vagal afferents play a role
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:16.600]   in the playing out of emotion states
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:20.320]   is a fascinating question that people are just beginning
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:21.700]   to scrape the surface of.
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:23.820]   But I think what's exciting now
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:25.960]   is that people are gonna be developing tools
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:28.940]   that will allow us to turn on or turn off
[01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:33.360]   specific subsets of fibers within the vagus nerve
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:37.060]   and ask how that affects particular emotional behaviors.
[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:38.680]   So you're absolutely right.
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:41.340]   This brain-body connection is critical,
[01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:45.020]   not just for the gut, but for the heart, for the lungs,
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:48.060]   for all kinds of other parts of your body.
[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:50.560]   And Darwin recognized that as well.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:54.680]   And I think it's a central feature of emotion state.
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:56.360]   And I think what underlies
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:59.860]   are subjective feelings of an emotion.
[01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:01.440]   Incredible.
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:04.320]   David, I have to say, as a true fan of the work
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:07.080]   that your lab has been doing over so many decades.
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:09.160]   And first of all, I was delighted
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:10.640]   when you stopped working on stem cells,
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:12.580]   not because you weren't doing incredible work there,
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:16.160]   but because I saw a talk where you showed a movie
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:19.880]   of an octopus spitting out or not spitting,
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:22.360]   but squirting out a bunch of ink and escaping.
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:24.120]   And you said you were gonna work on
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:25.600]   things of the sort that we're talking about today,
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.100]   fear, aggression, mating behaviors, social behaviors.
[01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:31.440]   It's been incredible to see the work that your lab has done.
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:36.440]   And I know I speak on behalf of a tremendous number of people
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:39.260]   and I say thank you for taking time
[01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:40.780]   out of your important schedule
[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:42.720]   to share with us what you've learned.
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:45.500]   My last question is a simple one,
[01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:48.360]   which is will you come back and talk to us again
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:50.880]   in the future about the additional work that's sure to come?
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:52.360]   I would be happy to do that.
[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:55.760]   And I really have appreciated your questions.
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:57.480]   They've all been right on the money.
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:00.860]   You've hit all of the critical important issues
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:05.660]   in this field and you've uncovered what is known,
[01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:08.840]   the little bit is known and how much is not known.
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:13.140]   And I think it's important to emphasize the unknown things
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:15.440]   because that's what the next generation
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:18.120]   of neuroscientists has to solve.
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:21.160]   And so I hope this will help to attract young people
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:24.320]   into this field because it's so important,
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:27.640]   particularly for our understanding of mental illness
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:31.720]   and mental health and psychiatry.
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:36.040]   We've got to figure out how emotion systems are controlled
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:39.920]   in a causal way if we ever want to improve
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:42.580]   on the psychiatric treatments that we have now.
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:44.960]   And that's gonna require the next generation
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.760]   of people coming into the field.
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:48.800]   - Absolutely, I second that.
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:50.360]   Well, thank you, it's been a delight.
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:53.460]   - Thank you, great, really appreciate it.
[01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:54.560]   - Thank you for joining me today
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:56.640]   for my discussion with Dr. David Anderson.
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:58.820]   Please also be sure to check out his new book,
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:01.800]   "The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us."
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:04.640]   It's a truly masterful exploration of the biology
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:07.120]   and psychology behind what we call emotions
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.040]   and states of mind and body.

[01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:26.280]   If you have questions or comments or suggestions

[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:29.000]   or guess you'd like us to interview
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.640]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:39.760]   at the beginning of today's podcast.
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:41.640]   And check out Momentous Supplements,
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:43.280]   our new partners in the supplement space,
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:45.320]   and check out Athletic Greens.
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:47.620]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[01:53:47.620 --> 01:53:49.880]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.160]   please do so.
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:52.920]   We are Huberman Lab on Twitter
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:54.960]   and we are also Huberman Lab on Instagram.
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:58.300]   And both places I cover science and science-related tools,
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:53:59.880]   some of which overlap with the content
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:01.040]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:03.260]   but much of which is unique from the content
[01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:04.800]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:06.480]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.160]   and Huberman Lab on Twitter.
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:11.040]   Please also check out our Neural Network monthly newsletter.
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:14.560]   This is a newsletter that has summaries of podcast episodes.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.840]   It also includes a lot of actionable protocols.
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:18.880]   It's very easy to sign up for the newsletter.
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:21.040]   You go to HubermanLab.com, click on the menu,
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:23.120]   go to newsletter, you supply your email,
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:25.120]   but we do not share your email with anybody.
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:28.020]   We have a very clear and rigorous privacy policy,
[01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:30.240]   which is we do not share your email with anybody.
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:32.740]   And the newsletter comes out once a month
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:34.280]   and it is completely zero cost.
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:36.320]   Again, just go to HubermanLab.com
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:38.760]   and go to the Neural Network newsletter.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:41.080]   I'd also like to point out that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:44.600]   has a clips channel, so these are brief clips,
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.640]   anywhere from three to 10 minutes
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:50.200]   that encompass single concepts and actionable protocols
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:53.380]   related to sleep, to focus, interviews with various guests.
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:54.760]   We talk about things like caffeine,
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:57.200]   when to drink caffeine relative to sleep,
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:59.840]   alcohol, when and how and if anyone should ingest it
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:03.500]   relative to sleep, dopamine, serotonin, mental health,
[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:05.120]   physical health, and on and on,
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:07.060]   all the things that relate to the topics
[01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:08.400]   most of interest to you.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:11.080]   You can find that easily by going to YouTube,
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:14.000]   look for Huberman Lab Clips in the search area,
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.520]   and it will take you there, subscribe,
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:17.880]   and we are constantly updating those with new clips.
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:19.440]   This is especially useful, I believe,
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:21.440]   for people that have missed some of the earlier episodes
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:23.060]   or you're still working through the back catalog
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:24.160]   of Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:26.280]   which admittedly can be rather long.
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:28.560]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:30.320]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:32.900]   [upbeat music]
[01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:35.480]   (upbeat music)
