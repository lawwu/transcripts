[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.780]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.280]   Mike is ever so helpful, always.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.280]   And Mike has a wonderful blog called The Oblivious Investor.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.480]   He's also the author of numerous helpful short books
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.560]   on single topics like social security and tax planning.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.820]   His latest book is called More Than Enough,
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.020]   which I think is highly relevant to a lot of people
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.640]   at this conference, which is considerations
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.880]   if when you look at your finances you actually see
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.520]   that you have more than enough to do the things that you want
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.200]   to do within your own lifetime, thinking about things
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.720]   that you might want your money to do
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.240]   for you, for others in your life.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.240]   He is going to be doing a session on Sunday morning
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.920]   that I wanted to call attention to that's kind
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.960]   of a reluctant spouses conversation.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.560]   And the idea is that we've spoken to attendees
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.080]   in the past who have said, "You know, I am the enthusiast
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.680]   in my family, my spouse is not into this stuff at all.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.120]   What's the bare minimum that he or she needs to know?
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.840]   How can I get him or her a little more enthused
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.120]   about this stuff?"
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.880]   So that will be the topic
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.920]   for Mike's discussion on Sunday morning.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.800]   The thing we're doing that's a little bit different
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.800]   about that session is that your partner needn't be enrolled
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.680]   in the conference, so they needn't be registered,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.840]   they can come and join us for breakfast and hear Mike's tips
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.560]   for getting the reluctant spouse along for the ride.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.560]   So I am so thrilled to introduce Mike, he's going to be talking
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.400]   to us about tax-advantaged accounts.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.200]   Thanks, Mike.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:02:02.480]   [ Applause ]
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.520]   >> All right, so Alan and Rick both spoke with you about how
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.360]   to select different investments.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.160]   And so now what we're talking about are the different types
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.320]   of accounts in which you might own those investments.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.480]   And we're going to be spending most
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.000]   of the time discussing tax-advantaged accounts.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.840]   But before we can actually talk about tax-advantaged accounts,
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.240]   we have to spend just a couple of minutes talking
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.520]   about regular taxable brokerage accounts so that then,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.520]   once you understand how those work, we can talk
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.480]   about how tax-advantaged accounts work differently.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:39.280]   Ah, okay, gotcha, thank you.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.000]   All right, so a taxable brokerage account,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.800]   this is anything that's not an IRA, not a 401(k),
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   it's not a 403(b), it's basically just if you went
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.760]   on the Vanguard or Fidelity or Schwab website, you opened
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.240]   up a new brokerage account,
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.720]   it would be a taxable brokerage account.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.920]   That's what we're talking about here.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.000]   And in these types of accounts, the interest that you earn every
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.280]   year is taxable at your ordinary income tax rate.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.960]   And the dividends that you earn are taxable as well.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.680]   The tax rate's a little bit lower, basically it only goes
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.680]   up to 20%, but they're still taxable.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.680]   And then whenever you sell something in a taxable account
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.400]   for more than what you paid for it, we call that a capital gain.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.040]   And capital gains are also taxable, and the tax rate depends
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.960]   on how long you owned that investment for selling it.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   So if you owned it for one year or less,
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.120]   we call it a short-term capital gain.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.400]   And those are taxable at your ordinary income tax rate,
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.840]   whereas long-term capital gains,
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.440]   which is when you've owned the investment for longer
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.200]   than one year, those are taxable
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.040]   at the same rates as qualified dividends.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.760]   So the summary of this whole slide is really just
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.240]   that we call these taxable accounts, because the returns
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.620]   that you earn in a taxable account are taxable.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.920]   That's the idea.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.120]   That's the thing you need to know about a taxable account.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.540]   And then in contrast, we have all of our tax-advantaged accounts.
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.800]   And tax-advantaged accounts includes IRAs, 401Ks, 403Bs,
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.040]   457s, HSAs, and 529s, and probably some other stuff too.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.760]   And in these types of accounts, you don't have to pay tax
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.800]   on the interest that you earn every year.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.480]   And you don't have to pay tax on the dividends
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.080]   that you earn every year.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.440]   And you don't have to pay tax
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.520]   on the capital gains whenever you sell stuff in one
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.360]   of these types of accounts.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.040]   And so the most important thing to know
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.320]   about tax-advantaged accounts is
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.640]   that they literally grow more quickly than a taxable account.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.440]   If you have the exact same investment in a taxable account
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.840]   and in an IRA, you're going to earn a greater return
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.640]   with that investment in the IRA
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.880]   because you don't have taxes taking a bite
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.680]   out of your return.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.000]   And there are also tax consequences,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.300]   either for putting money
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.080]   into tax-advantaged accounts or taking money out.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.640]   And what those consequences are depends
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.120]   on what type of account it is.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.080]   And we're going to dig into all of that.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.160]   But again, the single most important thing
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.840]   about tax-advantaged accounts is simply
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.200]   that you get the whole rate of return every year.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.080]   They grow faster than taxable accounts.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.720]   And that's a big deal.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.800]   So the first type of tax-advantaged account
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.840]   to discuss is the traditional IRA.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.360]   An IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.920]   And with IRAs, there's a limit
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.800]   to how much you can put in every year.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.040]   So the limit is the lesser of your earned income for the year
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.080]   or a fixed dollar amount for this year at 6,500 or 7,500
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.120]   for anybody age 50 and up.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.080]   And with a traditional IRA, the money that you put
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.120]   into the account, the contribution you make,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.840]   you get a deduction for that contribution
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.920]   if you don't have a workplace retirement plan.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.080]   So that's if you don't have a 401(k) or a 403(b), which again,
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.360]   we'll talk about those in a minute.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.120]   But if you don't have anything like that,
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.520]   then you get a deduction for contributing
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.800]   to a traditional IRA.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.840]   If you do have a plan like that, then there are income limits.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.840]   And what that means is that if you have a 401(k)
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.400]   or something similar, and your income is above this limit,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.800]   then you're still allowed to contribute to a traditional IRA,
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.280]   but you won't get a deduction for doing that.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.840]   And with a traditional IRA, just like every type
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.920]   of tax-advantaged account we're going to talk about --
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.160]   all right, with a traditional IRA, there is no tax
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.240]   on the growth while the money stays in the account.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.320]   So again, they grow faster than a taxable account
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.720]   because they're not paying tax on the interest
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.600]   and dividends every year.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.960]   And then when you take money out of a traditional IRA --
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.880]   so when you take money out of a tax-advantaged account,
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.320]   we call that a distribution, and distributions
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.960]   from traditional IRAs are taxable as income, generally.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.600]   And so we call these tax-deferred accounts
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.480]   because the idea is that you get some tax savings
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.680]   at the beginning because you get a deduction,
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.560]   and then you get some tax savings along the way
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.360]   because the growth is tax-free.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.280]   But then there's additional taxes at the end
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.040]   because it's all taxable when it comes out.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.280]   So you've deferred taxes.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.760]   You get savings at the beginning,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.920]   but additional taxes at the end.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.960]   So it's a tax-deferred account.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.680]   And one last thing to know about traditional IRAs is
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.080]   that there's a 10% penalty for any money you take
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.600]   out before age 59 and a half.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.480]   And the idea here is that Congress made these
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.880]   to be individual retirement accounts.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.600]   So they put that rule in place to discourage people
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.160]   from spending the money early, basically.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.360]   And then we have the Roth IRA.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.160]   In Roth accounts, Roth IRAs share a contribution limit
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.320]   with traditional IRAs.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.360]   So 6,500 for this year, or 7,500 for anybody age 50 and up.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.640]   And it is a shared limit.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.920]   So for instance, if you put 2,000 into a traditional IRA,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.080]   the most you could put into a Roth would be 4,500
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.680]   if you're under age 50.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.480]   And the ability to contribute to a Roth IRA phases
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.680]   out based on your modified adjusted gross income.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.200]   Really all that means is that if your income is too high,
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.760]   you can't contribute to a Roth IRA directly.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.320]   There is something called the backdoor Roth IRA strategy.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.240]   Admittedly, we don't actually have enough time to go
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.800]   into the details of that today.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.200]   But if your income is above those limits, that's something
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.520]   that you'll want to look up.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.760]   It's not quite as good as a regular Roth IRA contribution,
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.840]   but it's still, it's pretty close.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.280]   And with Roth accounts,
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.760]   you do not get a deduction for contributing.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.280]   So there's no tax savings immediately.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.960]   But the account does grow tax-free.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.360]   And the contributions to a Roth IRA, so the money
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.440]   that you put in, you're allowed to take it back out tax-free
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.000]   and penalty-free at any time.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.040]   You don't have to be age 59 and a half.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.200]   Christine mentioned this earlier.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.440]   This is a big deal.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.200]   It means that Roth IRAs can kind of serve
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.000]   as a backup emergency fund.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.480]   And this is a big advantage of Roth IRAs relative to all
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.840]   of the other types of retirement accounts.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.120]   And then the distributions of earnings,
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.360]   so that's all the growth in the account, that's also tax-free
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.920]   if you've had a Roth IRA for five years and you're
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.960]   at least age 59 and a half.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.400]   If you don't meet those requirements, then the growth
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.000]   when you take it out could be subject to a 10% penalty
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.800]   and it could be taxable, although there are some exceptions.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.200]   The traditional 401(k) and 403(b), and these types
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.320]   of accounts, are tax-deferred.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.600]   So they're a lot like a traditional IRA,
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.360]   just through your employer, in the sense
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.160]   that you get a deduction when you contribute,
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.040]   so you get some tax savings immediately.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.120]   And then it grows tax-free, so you don't have to pay tax
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.160]   on the interest and dividends every year.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.120]   And then it's taxable when you take it out.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.280]   So again, tax-deferred because you get some tax savings
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.800]   at the beginning, but additional taxes at the end.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.320]   And the contribution limit for 401(k)
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.520]   and 403(b) plans is a lot higher than for IRAs.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.240]   It's $22,500 this year, or $30,000 for anybody age 50 and up.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.680]   And some employers offer a matching contribution.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.120]   And what that means is simply that if you put
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.880]   in at least a certain percentage of your pay into the account,
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.680]   then your employer is also going to put in a certain percentage.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.000]   So for example, if your employer had a 4% dollar
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.960]   for dollar match, that would mean that if you put in 4%
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.680]   of your pay, or rather, at least 4% of your pay,
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.920]   you put in at least 4%, your employer will also put
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.520]   in another 4%, which means
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.040]   that you've basically doubled your money.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.520]   So it's 100% return without any risk,
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.440]   which is obviously a better deal than you get anywhere else.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.320]   And really, the big difference between 401(k)
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.840]   and 403(b) plans is not the tax treatment
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.000]   or any of the complicated rules.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.360]   It's really just who offers them.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.480]   401(k)s are offered by businesses to their employees,
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.080]   while 403(b)s are offered by educational institutions,
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.520]   so universities and things like that,
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.840]   as well as nonprofit organizations.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.640]   And then we have the Roth 401(k) and Roth 403(b),
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.840]   which is exactly what it sounds like.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.520]   It's a hybrid between a Roth IRA and a traditional 401(k).
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.400]   So because these are 401(k) and 403(b) accounts,
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.920]   they share the same contribution limit.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.760]   So it's $22,500 for this year, or $30,000 for people 50 and up.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.640]   And with any Roth account, you don't get a deduction
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.760]   for contributing to the account.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.880]   So there's no savings immediately.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.200]   But just like every tax-advantaged account,
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.080]   these grow tax-free, so you don't have to pay tax
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.960]   on the interest and dividends every year.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.320]   And then the distributions from a Roth 401(k)
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.760]   or Roth 403(b) are tax-free if you're at least age 59
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.720]   and a half, and your first Roth contribution
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.000]   to this particular plan was at least five years ago.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.760]   And lastly, for retirement accounts,
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.040]   we have the 457 plan, which is less likely that you're going
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.160]   to run into this during your career, because they're offered
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.480]   by a lot fewer employers, but they work differently
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.000]   than 401(k) and 403(b)s.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.640]   So if you do run into this, it's important
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.520]   to understand the distinctions.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.240]   So first thing that's the same with 401(k) and 403(b)s is
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.840]   that the dollar amount contribution limit is --
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.360]   it's the same for any given year, so $22,500 for this year.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.560]   However, it's not a shared limit.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.240]   So what that means is that if your employer offers a 401(k)
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.720]   and a 457, if you had enough income and enough cash flow,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.800]   you could put $22,500 into the 401(k)
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.440]   and another $22,500 into the 457.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.400]   So if your employer offers both, and you've got enough cash flow
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.800]   to do this, you can contribute quite a lot of money.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.120]   And 457 plans might allow
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.640]   for something called special catch-up contributions.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.160]   This is a weird one, because the tax code doesn't say they have
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.080]   to offer it, and it has to work like this.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.040]   So there's a little bit of leeway, basically,
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.680]   to the company offering the plan.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.360]   So if you have a 457 plan at work, you basically just want
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.920]   to talk to your HR department and ask
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.840]   about special catch-up contributions.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.360]   And then 457 plans can be tax-deferred,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.560]   or they can be Roth.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.840]   And if they're tax-deferred,
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.680]   they work pretty much how you would expect
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.280]   for a tax-deferred account, and that you get a deduction
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.840]   for contributing, the account grows tax-free,
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.200]   just like every tax-advantaged account,
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.160]   and distributions are taxable.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.960]   And if it's Roth, again, more or less what you would expect,
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.280]   because you don't get a deduction for contributing,
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.120]   but it does grow tax-free,
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.520]   and the distributions are tax-free also,
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.200]   including all of the growth, if you're at least age 59 and a half
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.960]   and you've met the five-year rule.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.080]   Now, one thing that surprises people about 457 plans is
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.120]   that there's no 10% penalty, whether we're talking
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.280]   about the tax-deferred or the Roth.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.120]   There just isn't one.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.960]   So that's a nice feature of 457 plans.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.080]   And then the last thing to know about 457 plans is
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.200]   that we break them down further into two subcategories.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.720]   The first is the governmental 457 plan,
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.000]   and then we have the non-governmental 457 plan,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.560]   and that's basically based on who your employer is.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.160]   If it's a government entity that employs you,
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.040]   it's probably a governmental 457 plan,
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.360]   and otherwise it's non-governmental.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.840]   And the thing to know here, there's a couple of distinctions,
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.840]   but really the most important one is
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.760]   that with a governmental 457 plan, the assets are, quote,
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.240]   "held in trust" for the employees.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.800]   What that means is that the money in the plan in an account
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.480]   with your name on it is literally
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.120]   in an account with your name on it.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.120]   So you don't have to worry that if your employer goes
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.520]   out of business or gets sued or there's, you know,
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.920]   files bankruptcy or whatever, you don't have to worry
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.520]   that the money's going to disappear
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.120]   because it's your money.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.040]   And by the way, that's also how 401(k) and 403(b) plans work.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.400]   You don't have to worry that if the employer goes
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.760]   out of business, you'll lose the money because that can't happen.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.080]   Non-governmental 457 plans don't work like that.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.680]   With a non-governmental 457 plan,
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.080]   the money that you've contributed to the plan,
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.440]   which you're probably thinking of as your money
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.400]   because you get a statement, has your name on it,
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.240]   shows balance, it's technically the employer's money still.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.320]   And so what that means is that if the employer goes
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.040]   out of business, you can lose that money.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.080]   And so that doesn't mean that you shouldn't contribute
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:20.000]   to a non-governmental 457, but it does mean that you need
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.320]   to understand that risk
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.520]   and really carefully weigh the pros and cons basically.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.520]   So that's it for retirement accounts.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.480]   Now if we move on to 529 plans, these are a tax-advantaged way
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.240]   to save for college.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.320]   And with 529 plans, there's no deduction for contributing
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.880]   to the account, but it grows tax-free just
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.040]   like everything we're talking about.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.560]   And the distributions are tax-free if you use the money
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.760]   to pay for qualified education costs.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.960]   And that includes college tuition and a handful
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.440]   of related expenses basically.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.440]   So these are kind of like a Roth IRA, but for college
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.880]   in the sense that there's no tax savings at the beginning,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.680]   but you get tax-free growth, and it all comes out tax-free
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.920]   if you jump through the appropriate hoops.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.440]   But if you take the money out and don't use it
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.000]   for qualified education costs, then the growth, the earnings,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.360]   that's going to be taxable,
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.800]   and it's subject to a 10% penalty.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.360]   And lastly, we have the health savings account.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.240]   And this is probably the most powerful account on the list,
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.960]   but the first thing to know about it is
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.760]   that you're not necessarily allowed to contribute to one.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.080]   Because in order to contribute to an HSA,
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.640]   you have to have what's called a high-deductible health
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.640]   insurance plan, and that basically means
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.360]   that the deductible for the year has to be
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.280]   at least a certain amount, which varies by year.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.320]   And so really the easiest way to know is every year
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.400]   when your employer sends you the PDF or the link
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.360]   with all the health insurance plans that you can choose from,
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.760]   or if you're buying insurance on the exchange
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.120]   and you're comparing the plans there, it will tell you.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.800]   If a plan is HSA-compatible,
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.680]   it will usually just have HSA in the name,
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.760]   or it will say HSA-compatible somewhere in the bullet points.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.200]   So that's the easiest way to know.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.560]   And with an HSA, you get a deduction
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.800]   for the contribution to the account.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.920]   So you get immediate tax savings,
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.920]   and then there's tax-free growth,
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.800]   and the distributions are tax-free
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.480]   if you use the money to pay for qualified medical expenses.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.480]   So these are called triple tax-free.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.880]   They're the only account like this
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.040]   where you get a deduction at the start, it grows tax-free,
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.600]   and the distributions are tax-free.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.280]   Nothing else works that way.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.200]   So if you have access to an HSA and you would plan
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.720]   to use the money eventually for qualified medical costs,
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.720]   or as Christine mentioned earlier, to reimburse yourself
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.640]   for previous qualified medical costs that you had,
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.440]   then an HSA is the best deal around.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.160]   If you take the money out and don't use it
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.080]   for qualified medical costs,
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.080]   then the full distribution is going to be taxable,
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.760]   and if you're younger than age 65, there's a 20% penalty.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.440]   And that's it for the different types
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.640]   of tax-advantaged accounts.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.400]   A little bit later, we're going to be discussing
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.360]   the most tax-efficient way to use all of your accounts.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.360]   (audience applauding)
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.360]   (audience clapping)
