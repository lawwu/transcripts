[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900]   What kind of comes out of this whole experience?
[00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.860]   A successful cocktail party has the energy in the room, very high.
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.620]   And somebody leaves your party saying, wow, that was like the best party.
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.060]   That was awesome.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.380]   And it's so simple.
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.440]   I got a message from a woman who just read my book and she hosted a party
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.020]   with name tags and ice breakers.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.180]   And she said that night, she and her husband got multiple text messages
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.500]   from friends saying that it was the best party that they'd ever thrown.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.100]   Why?
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.980]   Because they just added a little structure to it.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.480]   So what's the feeling?
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.340]   It's that feeling that when you're done hosting, you say that
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.380]   was awesome, and that was also easy.
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.440]   Like I could do that again, because I think we've all hosted parties where
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.540]   we're absolutely drained afterwards.
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.540]   And while it may have been a success, we never want to do it again.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.240]   Hello and welcome to another episode of all the hacks show about
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.200]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.200]   If you're new here, I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm a diehard
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.720]   optimizer who loves doing all the research to get the best experience
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.800]   in life without an expensive price tag.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.800]   So to make this happen, I sit down with the best experts each week and
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.440]   I learned all their strategies, tactics, and frameworks that shape their success.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.640]   So you hear the phrase cocktail party.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.520]   You might think like me, 1960s, dressed up couples, sipping
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.200]   martinis on a Mad Men set.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.280]   But that's not exactly what my guest, Nick Gray means when he says that almost
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.080]   everyone should be hosting cocktail parties.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.040]   Nick's the author of a new book called the two hour cocktail party, how to
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.720]   build big relationships with small gatherings, and he's on a mission to
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.960]   get people to have more parties, to make connections, build friendships,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.360]   and live a richer life now between kids and COVID I haven't hosted many
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.840]   gatherings in a while, but when Nick told me he wrote his book for people
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.080]   like me and not for people who already host events all the time, I was really
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.960]   excited, so we're going to get tactical in this conversation, I want to hear
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.240]   why a cocktail party is a better way to get to know people than just having
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.320]   dinner, why Nick thinks name tags and icebreakers are non-negotiable for
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.280]   parties, and I want to get a complete run through of everything you need
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.880]   to do to make an event easy and effortless from invites to food and
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.920]   drink to getting to leave on time.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.280]   But that's not all because Nick also founded a company called Museum Hacks
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.940]   to lead these renegade tours of museums like the Met in New York
[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.320]   and others around the country.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.040]   It's been featured in all kinds of media from the Wall Street
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.320]   Journal to the New York Times.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.640]   And after a little research, I'm hoping I can take one of these tours soon.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.040]   But in the meantime, I will make sure we also get all his Museum Hacks today too.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.760]   And on top of that, Nick is an avid traveler and a fellow optimizer, so
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.840]   I'm certain we'll uncover some other hidden gems in this conversation.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.160]   So let's get started.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.400]   Nick, welcome to the show.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.880]   I'm happy to be here.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.600]   We're going to get real tactical today.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.960]   That's fantastic.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.840]   So I'm going to jump right in and just ask, why cocktail parties?
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.560]   You can get 80% of the benefits of hosting a dinner party with 20% of
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.840]   the work by hosting a cocktail party.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.880]   Now, like anybody can write a book to teach you how to host one dinner
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.240]   party, but the reality is, is that most people will never do it again.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.720]   And dinner parties are too hard.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.840]   They're too complicated.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.080]   A lot of people give entrepreneurs this advice, like host a dinner
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.480]   party or host a mastermind, and I think that's actually terrible
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.080]   advice for most people, you get most of the benefits from hosting when you
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.840]   can actually make it a habit and something where you always have
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.000]   your next party on the calendar.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.240]   To do that, I built the easiest possible framework and
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.760]   formula for hosting events.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.840]   So I've looked at that formula and I know you have all these things,
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.240]   name tags, icebreakers, firm stopping times, what's important?
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.320]   Why are they important?
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.520]   And how do you actually get people to kind of play along and agree to them?
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.240]   Well, one of the first things is that the best day to host an event
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.800]   might not be the one that you think.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.680]   For example, I highly suggest that everybody hosts their parties
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.120]   on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday nights.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.040]   Why those?
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.520]   We can go into that if you want, basically because they're
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.480]   non-competitive social nights.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.120]   Most people don't have things going on.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.200]   Second of all is I always give a stop time to my parties, two hours.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.960]   There's a start time, there's an end time, and there's hidden
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.760]   benefits in having a stop time.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.480]   One of which is that it gets all your guests to show up on time, right?
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.760]   When you're a host, you know, that beginning hour when
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.600]   nobody really shows up, it's slow.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.360]   When you have a tight two hour thing, then folks show up on time and you end
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.600]   the party when things are going well, so that your friends, guests, your
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.240]   colleagues, they want to come back the next time that you host.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.000]   And when you host regularly, is it always the same people or do
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.640]   people feel left out or how does that work?
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.400]   Great question.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.360]   I usually mix it up.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.080]   I'll do half repeat guests, half new guests.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.920]   Um, you really get the best benefits when you're going through life.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.120]   Let's say that you're hosting a cocktail party once every six weeks.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.160]   Between those parties, you're meeting all these random people.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.200]   And here's why, here's why I did this, why I can change your listener's life.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.240]   We meet all these interesting people that we never do anything with.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.400]   Like you meet them, they're cool.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.520]   And you're like, oh, that person was interesting, but I'm not going to go out
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.280]   of my way to schedule a dinner with them.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.120]   I'm not going to go out of my way to, you know, schedule a one-on-one meeting
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.400]   or a hangout with them because life's busy and things happen.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.760]   When you have a cocktail party, you get to kind of collect all of those
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.840]   interesting people that you meet through life and bring them back in.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.080]   And then sort of almost audition them to see if you want to be friends with them
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.400]   or build a relationship, almost something like that.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.040]   I hope that doesn't sound bad.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.600]   No, no, it's funny.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.800]   I, we went to a birthday party, uh, for a kid named Jackson.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.520]   Uh, I'd never met Jackson my whole life.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.280]   My daughter, uh, has met him at the park with our au pair.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.840]   And we got this kind of invite through the nanny group to us.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.520]   And so we go to this party.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.680]   We don't know a single person.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.280]   And now we just met, I don't know, 10 couples with kids, our kids age.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.760]   And I will share this is because we didn't know what to do with them.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.760]   We're like, you seem cool.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.680]   We've got kids the same age, but do we really want to orchestrate
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.440]   10 play dates or group play?
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.080]   Like, it just seemed like we met these interesting parents
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.840]   and we didn't know what to do.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.160]   So you've sold me on the fact that like dinner is not going to happen.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.680]   I'm not going to schedule 10 dinners because that's going to take me the next,
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.160]   I don't know, 10, it feels like 10 months of, of dinners straight.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.200]   So that's the, like, I get it.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.120]   I get why I should do it, but it seems like a lot of work.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.120]   So I'd love to just dial in, like, how do you make this?
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.240]   You said 20% of the work of a dinner party.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.360]   How is that possible?
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.040]   Okay.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.920]   I found when I was scheduling dinners that first of all, you have
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.960]   to stress about all the food, by the way, it's not about the food.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.440]   The hack is that if you are insistent on hosting a dinner party, just order out.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.320]   Don't try to cook the food yourself.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.600]   Nobody cares about the food.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.320]   They're coming for the people and for the conversation.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.200]   When you order out, it allows you to be a little, a little less stressed about that.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.160]   But how is it more efficient?
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.160]   How can you get 80% of the benefits with 20% of the work?
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.080]   Well, 80% of the benefits at a dinner party.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:19.160]   Um, have you read the book, um, the art of gathering by Priya Parker?
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.440]   I have not absolutely fantastic book.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.520]   And in there, she says one thing that when you have a dinner party with more
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.720]   than six people, the conversation will naturally split into two smaller groups.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.080]   So if you have a dinner party with eight or dinner party with 10,
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.800]   the conversation will split.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.160]   Unless you're doing Jeffersonian single track with a very skilled facilitator,
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.080]   moderator, the conversation naturally will split into smaller groups.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.320]   And so I generally would have a dinner party with about
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.240]   six because that's easy to host.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.760]   Uh, I find that by hosting a cocktail party and by the way, the sweet spot,
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.840]   the number of people that you want to have attend is 15 to 20.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.120]   Why is that?
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.680]   Because less than 15, there's not enough energy.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.480]   There's not enough dynamic, new connections and possibilities.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.320]   If you have a group of 10 people over two hours, you can survey the room
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.920]   visually and generally you'll talk to pretty much everybody with 15 people.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.040]   With 20 people, you probably won't get a chance to talk to everybody.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.680]   And it leaves this excitement and energy for all of your guests,
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.200]   especially in the room as well.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.080]   That is a little known fact that the more people you have, the
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.000]   easier it is for you as a host.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.120]   If you are hosting seven people, six people, there's a lot of work.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.320]   You're kind of always on, you are the host at all the time.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.040]   When you're 15 to 20 people, you get to step back into the role
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.880]   of facilitator a little bit more.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.440]   And my book speaks a lot about that.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.200]   I can share those facilitation tips and tricks for you, but that's why for
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.760]   me, it's so much less work and I can connect with so many more people in the
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.520]   time it takes to watch a Netflix movie.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.720]   So I've got the number of people I've got the day of the week.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.640]   Well, you know, is this send a, an e-vite or how do you kind of get
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.360]   the people to the place and kind of, where do you do it just at your home?
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.440]   Do you rent a venue?
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.000]   I'm just going to go through all the questions I have.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.680]   Cause in my mind, I'm already starting to plan the next one.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.320]   Well, if you're open to it, can we just plan yours?
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.720]   Can we just do that?
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.520]   And then I'll tell you step by step.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:22.840]   Okay.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.960]   So first step is you need to pick a day and you need to give yourself
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.320]   three to four weeks minimum in advance.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.640]   That's what I call the party runway.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.200]   It's so that you can fill up your guest list, have plenty
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.520]   of time to plan and prepare.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.120]   And so to do that, then you need to pick a date, a Monday or Tuesday, Wednesday.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.160]   That's minimum three weeks in advance.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.240]   Do you have a date that would work for you?
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.520]   First time here.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.040]   Should I go like on the short end, four weeks, I got a date for you that
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.320]   works in, uh, in August about a month out.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.240]   Yeah, probably.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.120]   I probably have a date that works in September, like two months out.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.840]   August is it let's do it sooner rather than later, because what a lot of
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.680]   people will say when they host this price, Oh yeah, that makes sense.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.520]   I'll do it.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.160]   And so I want to do it when it's perfect.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.280]   No, like this is something hosting is something that we're going to
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.440]   do naturally and regularly.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.240]   We're not going to wait for it to be perfect.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.040]   And so I would even rather you do this first one sooner, just so you
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.600]   can see how easy it's going to be.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.640]   And then you can do one that'll be even better later in September.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.400]   So if you have that date, what day of the week is it?
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.480]   Is it a Monday and Tuesday?
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.120]   I went Wednesday.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.480]   Great.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.600]   Now you need to pick a two hour time block.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.000]   What two hours for me when I was in New York city, I would choose
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.680]   seven to 9:00 PM, eight to 10 PM.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.680]   Even because I'm single because in New York, people stay up later.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.440]   Now I'm in Austin, Texas and people do things earlier.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.960]   So here it's more like five to 7:00 PM, six to eight.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.320]   What two hour time block would be good for you?
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.520]   I mean, we have kids and so, you know, I would, I mean, there's a whole
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.640]   question I have about how does this whole scenario change with children?
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.160]   Because, you know, our kids eat dinner and go to bed.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.280]   Like, do you invite them?
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.040]   So let me talk about that right now.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.240]   Let's talk about that right now.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.080]   So what time do your kids go to sleep?
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.800]   We, well, one is only a month.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.080]   So it's just kind of on demand whenever, but, but the two year old, we
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.200]   usually do dinner around six, six 30.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.320]   Do bedtime routine, seven, seven 30, and kind of from seven 30 on, she
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.720]   might not be asleep, but she's kind of in her room doing her own
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.080]   thing, hopefully falling asleep.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.760]   Uh, so you have a one month old and you have a two month old, right.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.360]   Or sorry, a one year old.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.080]   One month old and a two year old.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.840]   So five to seven could work.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.640]   Uh, you know, we would just maybe need someone to help get her some food
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.320]   so that when the party wraps at seven, we'll go put her down.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.040]   So I love that idea for five to 7:00 PM.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.440]   And you're speaking a lot about what do you do?
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.800]   How do you have a party with kids?
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.560]   And the advice that I've gotten and I've worked and I've trained a lot of people
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.080]   to host their first party is they say that you have to have the childcare
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.920]   handled, not just for your kids, but for any of the other people who you
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.720]   might invite to make it easy for them to say yes, and to swing by.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.560]   And so to that extent, can you have childcare that's available, whether
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.000]   it's your au pair or hiring another babysitter as well, even if you
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.800]   have to spend an extra, I don't know how much babysitters cost 50, a hundred
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.520]   dollars, even if you had to spend a little bit extra to have one extra.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.960]   Person that was on hand, the concept of the idea would be to have like a
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:29.020]   simultaneous children's party in your home, in another room, separate from the
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.760]   adults, how does that sound?
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.240]   Or how does that hit for you?
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.640]   I mean, I think that can work.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.040]   Like we could, we could ask around it's in the summer.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.960]   There's a lot of kids in our neighborhood that are home from college.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.680]   We could probably find a couple of people to help entertain kids or, you
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.240]   know, I'm, I'm less worried about that and more worried, you know, are, are
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.160]   the parents going to want to let their kids go hang out with a random person?
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.040]   Are they going to want them to like hang out in the back, a second half of the
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.400]   backyard so you can maybe have the kids in the backyard where they're kind of
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.320]   in eyeshot, but kind of doing their own thing, both of those things, but just
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.280]   having the extra set of hands available during the party will let you figure
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.400]   out and feel the vibe.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.320]   Do you feel that your, um, questions or concerns of managing the kids during
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.680]   the party are now handled doing it on a Wednesday night from five to 7:00 PM?
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.520]   Yeah, I think, I think that, I mean, we'll find out, uh, you know, if anyone
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.720]   shows up or they're all like, no, I've got kids, I can't do five to seven.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.320]   I think the biggest question is if everybody feeds their kids five to six
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.440]   o'clock, how are the kids going to get fed?
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.800]   So you might not need parent food, but you know, kids might need food.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.440]   Well, I'm so glad that you mentioned that.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.520]   Cause if, if one of your listeners is saying, why are they talking
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.200]   about kids so much?
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.000]   I don't have kids.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.080]   Well, the next step is going to apply both to you and to somebody without kids.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.800]   Now that you've picked your proposed date and time Wednesday from what
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.440]   time was it again from five to seven.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.140]   Okay.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.800]   You're now going to think about what I call your core group.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.080]   Your core group will be your closest friends, neighbors, or colleagues
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.080]   who you would invite to this party.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.880]   And you need a minimum of five of them who would say yes.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.840]   So to get to five, you may need to invite eight to 10, even.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:12.960]   So can you think, or can you write down right now, the names of, you know, five
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.000]   to 10 of those people that you would invite first, that would be part
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.480]   of what's called your core group.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.340]   Yes.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.680]   I don't think I'd have to write it down.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.800]   Cause you know, I think when we, you know, we've done our, everything
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.920]   from baby showers to stuff like that.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.400]   It's like, I think I have that list prepared somewhere, but we don't
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.440]   have to go through it all right here.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.460]   Good.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.600]   Well, you know who that is and you know how to message them.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.560]   Your next step is going to be to send them a text message, a DM, however
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.840]   you communicate most casually saying, Hey, my wife and I are thinking
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:50.080]   about hosting a casual cocktail party on Wednesday night from six
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.160]   to 8:00 PM or from five to 7:00 PM.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.160]   Would that work for you?
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.000]   And if we do it, would you come?
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.720]   By getting those five first people to say, yes, that's what
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.400]   you're looking for is five yeses.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.560]   You've done a little bit of a survey to know that more or less this will work
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.560]   for them and now your party is going to happen.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.160]   You're not going to make an event page.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.720]   You're not going to share it with anybody else until you get those five yeses.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.320]   And so since you've set your date out about four weeks, you're going to give
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.440]   yourself the next one, two, three days to try to collect those five yeses.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.120]   If you cannot get the five yeses, because people are saying, uh, no way we can do
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.320]   that, the kids are going to go down.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.240]   I can't work that with our schedule.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.400]   Then you're going to modify based on your environmental situation.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.200]   You'll say, you know what?
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.600]   It's actually impossible for us to do this during the weeknight because
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.440]   the kids were going to rejigger this.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.000]   I know that Nick said on a Monday or a Tuesday or Wednesday, let's actually
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.600]   try this on a Sunday afternoon.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.480]   Okay.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.320]   You can do that once you've done the first sample, but once you get those
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.720]   five yeses, now your party is happening and it's off to the races.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.360]   Do you think that you would be able to get those five yeses?
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.280]   Just, I think we can get five yeses though.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.680]   When you said Sunday afternoon, my gears went, oh man, Sunday afternoon
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.920]   feels like the, such a family friendly time after the nap, before dinner,
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.760]   you could do like four to six, but for the sake of this conversation, let's,
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.320]   I assume everything else will apply the same.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.120]   Okay, good.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.640]   So now you've gotten those five yeses.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:26.640]   Your next immediate step is to create an RSVP page to collect
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.640]   the confirmations from people.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.680]   What do we do by collecting the RSVPs?
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.240]   Have you used any of these like social platforms, paperless post,
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.960]   Evite, Eventbrite, which ones do you guys use?
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.080]   Or what have you used recently?
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.120]   I think, I mean, I think we did paperless post for baby shower, but I'm very
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.720]   curious to know like, what's, what's your go-to?
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.560]   Cause paperless post, you can get lost in like, oh, which design do I want?
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.760]   And they charge you, somebody just told me that in order for you to download
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.680]   a CSV of the emails or something, they charge you, which is sneaky.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:16:59.640]   I understand.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.280]   But sometimes for my friends, I don't, they're like, I'm not signing
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.760]   up for a subscription service.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.720]   Um, the platform that I like the best, most that I recommend is a service
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.640]   called Mixily, M-I-X-I-L-Y.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:21.280]   The youth love a service called a Partyful, P-A-R-T-I-F-U-L.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.120]   I like Mixily and that is what I use.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.360]   I'm hosting a party tonight.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.720]   It's the service that I use.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.880]   There's no charge.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.360]   There is no fees.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.080]   They don't spam your guests.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.400]   There's no ads.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.520]   You don't need to download special software.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:40.440]   We're looking for the easiest way for someone to simply RSVP to your party.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.520]   And why do we do that?
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.240]   Because they make a social contract and they say, I'm going to show up.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.760]   And a lot of the work that I'm going to give you advice is just going to be
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.640]   making sure that people will attend.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.480]   And one of the ways we do that is by getting them to RSVP, not just saying,
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.440]   yes, they'll come on text, but to further their commitment by RSVP.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.320]   And so all those five have said, yes, you're now going to text them back.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.080]   Perfect.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.320]   Let me make an event page.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.520]   I'll follow up in a day or two.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.000]   You make the event page, you send them the link and you say, will you please
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.280]   RSVP here just so we can get a head count.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:19.920]   You will now have a landing page for your party that lists five or more people who
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:25.200]   are coming showing social proof to everybody else you invite that people are
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.640]   actually going to come to this party.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.240]   Have you ever been invited to an event?
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.520]   And like, you've clearly been spam the invitation.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.600]   It's like 93 invited and two attending.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.760]   Um, that's bad.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.760]   And we're never going to do that because we're always going to ask people, can you
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.520]   come before you send the invitation?
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.120]   So you get your five yeses.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.960]   You make the event page, you get them all to sign up on RSVP.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.520]   Now you can invite a wider group that I call your great guests.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.520]   These are your acquaintances.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.680]   These are where you're going to fill up the rest of the guest list to get from 15
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.080]   to 20 attendees, not including the kids.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.720]   I'll take a pause to see what type of questions you have or thoughts or feedback.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.080]   No, that makes sense.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:12.720]   I assume a guest, if you're inviting, you know, mostly couples is each couple is two
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.200]   people.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.240]   So it's, you know, you probably are, if you're having 15 to 20, you're having,
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.080]   you know, eight to eight to 10 couples.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.880]   If that's mostly the demographic.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.840]   Yes.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.200]   Yes.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:23.400]   Yes.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:23.960]   That makes sense.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:29.040]   It's so funny because I, when I would host my dinner parties, I would finally
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.320]   curate the guest list and I would try to invite all these entrepreneurs and other
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.440]   people, and they'd ask, oh, can I bring my girlfriend?
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.360]   Can I bring so-and-so?
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:43.120]   And I would say no, because, um, I'm curating a specific group of people there.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.400]   And that is blasphemy.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.880]   If you tell somebody that they cannot bring their partner, unless it's a very
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.920]   strictly business event, if it's a social event, you're like, no, you can't bring
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.360]   your partner.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.280]   It's very sketchy.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:59.320]   So I now no longer suggest that people limit their guest list.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:04.440]   And oftentimes for people hosting their first party, you just want warm bodies.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.800]   You just want as many people to say yes.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.800]   And so for your first party, I really need to encourage you, Chris, do
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.600]   not try to finally curate it.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.720]   Do not try to invite VIPs to this.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:23.520]   Simply invite people that you feel comfortable with to run through the
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.520]   pieces of this party formula that I'm going to share.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.160]   Okay.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.720]   So I've got this page set up.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.720]   What do I put on it?
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.560]   So the important thing about the page is you have to set the expectations of
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.000]   what is going to happen at this party.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.480]   And there's two unique things at one of my parties.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:45.360]   Number one, is there are name tags and number two, there's icebreakers.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.120]   I can talk about why those are important, but I can tell you that by listing them
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:56.960]   in the invitation, it will remove 95% of concerns that people that have on the
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.520]   event that they're going to sign up to an RSVP, by the way, you're also going to
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.000]   list not only the start time, but the end time.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.360]   Many people are like, how do I get people to leave my party?
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:13.960]   And by letting them know that there is an end time by clearly listing that, then it
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.560]   helps people to know, and it also encourages them to show up on time.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.400]   Like we talked about.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.920]   So letting them know that there will be name tags and icebreakers.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:29.480]   I usually say something simple like, Hey, I'm getting some friends together, uh,
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:33.280]   to have cocktails and a round of icebreakers.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.600]   There will be name tags because I'm bad with names, LOL.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.280]   Um, this is super casual.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.800]   Uh, you don't have to dress up.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.760]   You don't have to bring anything.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.920]   We'll have mixers, drinks, alcohol, and seltzer, and maybe
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.160]   you'll meet some new friends.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.840]   That's the general gist of what the invitation page will say.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:59.600]   And by giving people knowing what to expect, it not only helps them have a
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.440]   successful event, but it also encourages people that are kind of shy or like
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.800]   introverted many times, we don't think about those types of people.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.520]   You're a podcast host, so you're probably pretty outgoing.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.200]   I probably sound pretty extroverted and outgoing, but a lot of my work in my
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.320]   book works to help people make their parties feel safe and comfortable for
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.200]   those that might not, or might be a little socially awkward, even after COVID too.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.280]   You didn't mention anything about food.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.920]   Is that because there's no food at this party?
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.880]   There's no food.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.320]   There's only the most basic snacks.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.080]   If you had to think of a simple way to think about my parties, you would
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.680]   think about the NIC party formula.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.040]   N-I-C-K.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.440]   N stands for name tags.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.080]   I stands for icebreakers.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.440]   C stands for cocktails only, no food.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.880]   And K stands for kick them out at the end.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.640]   The party's only two hours.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.240]   Now, why is there no food?
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.680]   I have a pretty hard rule that there's no food because in the event that you say,
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:02.560]   well, maybe we'll just do some past appetizers, it completely changes
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.320]   the level of stress that's involved.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.600]   You can add food later on.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.840]   And in fact, my book goes through and I can just tell you what to have now.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.920]   You can have baby carrots.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.040]   You can have salted nuts.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.360]   You can have prepared kind of easy food, like snacks, chips,
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.920]   dip, people love guacamole.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.280]   Those things are simple that take minimal preparation.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:27.040]   But the whole purpose of this is to show you how easy hosting an event can be.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.600]   And that it's not about the food.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.560]   It's about the people.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.000]   Name tags make sense.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.400]   Kick them out.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.040]   Makes sense though.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.920]   I do want to know what's the, what's the way to kick the people out?
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.040]   Like, let's say it's, it's five to seven.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.360]   It's sevens rolls around.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.000]   I I'm guessing most people there aren't like, Oh, looking at the time.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.160]   Uh, what do you say to people?
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.640]   So you, as the host, we'll make a last call about 15 minutes before
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.400]   the party's scheduled to end.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.520]   You would turn down the music and make a little announcement.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.600]   And so I'll say something like, all right, everybody.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.000]   Thank you so much for coming.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.240]   It's seven 45.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.760]   I said, this party would go till eight.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.960]   I know it's a school night, so I'm going to let you home.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.400]   Uh, grab a last drink.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.520]   Say hello to somebody new.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.280]   If you hadn't had a chance yet, and we'll start to wrap up in about 15 minutes.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.120]   And then I'll turn the music back up at the time.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.600]   The party is scheduled to end.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.320]   I will turn all the lights up.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.760]   I'll turn the music down.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.080]   I'll thank everybody for coming.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.760]   Maybe I'll do a group photo.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.040]   I do something else that I hesitate to say because it'll
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.440]   make the party sound very weird.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.520]   But at my parties, I do a little cheer.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.040]   I've had people have very success with doing this, but it does
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.480]   feel like a kid's summer camp.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.440]   But it adds a finality or sort of an end to it.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.240]   And as silly and ridiculous as my formula sounds, I promise
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.920]   you that it really does work.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.760]   I love it.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.080]   Okay.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:45.440]   Okay.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.520]   I have a couple of fobs.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.560]   You said music.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.760]   Yeah, they're like a go-to playlist.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.400]   I feel like that could be a stressful thing for a lot of people
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.640]   trying to curate what's playing.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.360]   Oh my gosh.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:58.520]   Never, never try to pre-program a playlist.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.080]   You want easy, happy music that is not too loud.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.200]   I will play the Beach Boys channel on a streaming service.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.080]   It's easy.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.160]   It's non-controversial.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.080]   It's upbeat.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.320]   It's generally positive.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.120]   I'm looking for stuff like that.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:18.440]   I have collected a list of playlists, www.party.pro/playlists
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.040]   of party playlists that my friends and readers and other hosts have used.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.840]   But generally you just want something very easy.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.920]   That's background music.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.560]   That's upbeat and happy.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.560]   Cocktails.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.960]   You brushed over quickly.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.720]   It can be a lot of work to make a mixed drink.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.960]   Is this really just like only cocktails or is this beer, wine?
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.840]   And if you want a cocktail, you can make it.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.280]   What's the drink situation?
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.600]   First controversial thing.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.600]   There's no beer and I'll tell you why there's no beer.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.000]   Second thing I wrote a book called the two hour cocktail party
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.440]   and I don't even drink alcohol.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.880]   So that's ironic.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.840]   There's not a single mixed drink recipe that's in the book, but we use that
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.240]   phrase cocktail party because it encapsulates a social construct of as an
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:07.960]   easy event that is lightweight and acceptable to pop into when I say the
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:12.400]   phrase cocktail party, what do you think of what sort of comes to mind to you?
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:12.880]   Chris.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.160]   I mean, like I said in the intro, it feels very like, you know, walk
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.880]   in, grab a martini kind of thing.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.520]   But, uh, when I, when it comes out of your mouth, it obviously
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.480]   doesn't feel that way.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.680]   It feels a bit more casual.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.160]   Well, the reality is, is what drinks are you going to have at your party?
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.920]   You're going to have a do it yourself, serve yourself bar.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.400]   And so that can be a couple bottles of alcohol.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.520]   You can have vodka or tequila or whiskey or bourbon or whatever.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.480]   You're going to have some basic mixers.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.840]   You'll have a bowl filled with ice.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.920]   You'll have maybe some juice and plenty of non-alcoholic options like
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.360]   seltzer, seltzer, water, or hard seltzer.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.240]   Now I do not include beer for my list.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.200]   Are you a beer drinker?
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.800]   I'm a casual beer drinker.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.080]   Like I enjoy beer, but I wouldn't say it's always my go-to.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.920]   Do you have friends that are beer drinkers that are beer drinkers?
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.880]   I mean, I would be shocked if anyone ever says no to that.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:08.120]   So generally what I find with beer drinkers is that they are highly brand loyal.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.360]   Beer drinkers are very specific in their beer preferences.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:17.560]   They're highly brand loyal and beer just creates a lot of party shrapnel.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.680]   What do I mean by that?
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.720]   I mean, like there's extra beer bottles, there's beer cans.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.760]   It's just like all this extra stuff.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.640]   What type of beer?
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.440]   Well, if I'm going to buy this beer, then you need another
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.600]   type of beer for somebody else.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.320]   If you want to serve beer at your party, you absolutely can.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.400]   But I want to tell all your listeners, I've hosted hundreds
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.080]   of parties, never serving beer.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.280]   And it's just another thing to remove the stress for me.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.480]   And I've never had a complaint.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.840]   So there's all these little hacks that I'm doing, which is just trying
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.960]   to make it as easy as possible to teach you that you can host and you
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.360]   can make hosting easy and that it can absolutely change your life.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.280]   If you become someone who hosts.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.040]   Okay.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.640]   So I've got the drinks that want, you didn't mention wine.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.400]   Is there wine there?
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.160]   Wine, some white wine, some red wine in the summertime, a
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.320]   rosé, just get two bottles of each.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.040]   That hit everything except this whole, this kind of looming topic of icebreakers.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.640]   And I think anyone listening right now is kind of wondering, Oh gosh.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.680]   Like what, what does Nick mean when he says icebreaker?
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.320]   And why do icebreakers?
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.800]   Aren't those, aren't those silly?
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.560]   Aren't those childish?
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:22.680]   Well, we do icebreakers because it's a short survey of the room.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:28.200]   And icebreakers also not only give your guests excuses to go meet new people,
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.360]   which by the way, that's why your party is going to be very successful.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.280]   And that's why your friends will love you for hosting this because you are
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.200]   going to help them meet new people.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.640]   Most adults haven't made a new friend in the last three years.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.280]   And yet, as we get older, we need friends more than ever, right?
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.120]   Friends become like a game of attrition.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.480]   They have kids, they move, things happen.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.000]   We don't see people as often.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.520]   Your party will be successful because all of your guests are
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.480]   going to talk to a lot of new people.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   How do we encourage that by using these icebreakers?
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.920]   Icebreakers are a short survey of the room.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.720]   Generally you'll go around the circle.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.840]   You say your name, you'll say what you do for work.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.640]   If you don't want to say for work, you say something you're excited about.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.360]   And then the third one, which is the icebreaker question.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:12.720]   Okay.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.440]   So each icebreaker has three parts, name, what you do for work, and
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.560]   then the icebreaker question, right?
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.360]   You'll do three rounds of icebreakers.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:26.560]   I think of icebreakers as a green, yellow, red, uh, scaffolding where you
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.320]   would want to start your party with a green level icebreaker.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.480]   A green level icebreaker.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:35.960]   The one that I use that I suggest everybody use for the first one is what
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.160]   is one of your favorite things to eat for breakfast?
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.040]   So first, how does that hit with you?
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:43.760]   What are your thoughts?
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.400]   I'm ready for it.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.160]   If you hate it, then tell me and I'll tell you why it's great, but
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.120]   I just want to hear your thoughts.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.720]   I mean, I don't actually eat breakfast that often.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.160]   So I, because, because why not?
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.440]   Why don't you choose to eat breakfast?
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.880]   Uh, I.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:57.800]   I don't know.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.240]   I just, you just skip it's not for health reasons.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.680]   You know, I didn't run fast and you just, I'm just lazy.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:08.040]   Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes it's been, uh, intermittent fasting.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.360]   Sometimes it's just been like, I don't want to, it's just one more
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.720]   thing to think about during the day.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.240]   Yes.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.960]   Um, yeah, when you do eat breakfast, what's one of your favorite
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.920]   things to eat for breakfast?
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.520]   When you do, I mean, when I do eat breakfast, it's usually like some
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.040]   ridiculous, like make an amazing breakfast for the weekend kind of thing.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.560]   Like lemon ricotta pancakes.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.600]   Are you lemon ricotta pancakes?
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.440]   Are you kidding me?
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.840]   That's like a go-to, uh, you know, once a month kind of thing in our house.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.000]   I've asked this icebreaker hundreds of times.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.560]   I've never heard somebody say lemon ricotta pancakes.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.520]   That's incredible.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.360]   Cause I think it's like, I don't make a lot of breakfast.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.160]   So if I do make breakfast, I'm going to step it up.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.560]   And I have this recipe.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.520]   I, now I feel like I should put it in the show notes that I think is just like
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.120]   every time I make these lemon ricotta pancakes, I'm like, I'm going to make
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.640]   like every time I make these lemon ricotta pancakes and they're not that
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.520]   hard, it just wins every time.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.200]   Wait, now I got to know what, like, how long does it take you to make that?
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:01.480]   Okay.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.800]   Look, if we're doing this at my party, I just want to show you right
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.920]   there, what just happened.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.080]   You expressed a piece of your personality that you share and you make your secret
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.280]   thing, lemon ricotta pancakes.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.320]   Now you might not always eat breakfast, but you did get to share when you do
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.680]   make breakfast, what you make.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.080]   Okay.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.600]   Everybody chooses or not chooses to eat breakfast every single day.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:31.640]   And it is generally a positive, happy feeling that we have a good green level
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.600]   icebreaker is an icebreaker.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:39.400]   That's quick to answer it's fast and it doesn't incur judgment from others.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.880]   A bad green icebreaker, which I would never do would be something like say
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.600]   your name, so what you do for work and say your favorite book ever.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.240]   Okay.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.800]   Because that's subjective.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.280]   That's definitive.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.840]   That's very hard to pick it.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.200]   It's going to maybe elicit a little bit of judgment.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.360]   People are going to try to show off.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.160]   They don't know.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.800]   Now, how do we modify that?
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.000]   Right.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.520]   It's what I said.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.880]   What's one of your favorite things to eat for breakfast?
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.520]   I still wouldn't ask what's one of your favorite books.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.880]   I would ask that later because a book is an intellectual thing, right?
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.360]   Breakfast is a human delicious thing.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.560]   It's a fun thing.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.680]   It's an easy thing.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:24.080]   So we ask that as just a way for everybody at your party to sort of sound off and
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.120]   express a piece of their personality.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.640]   You do it very quick.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.520]   A good icebreaker is a quick icebreaker.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.800]   So you're not going to allow for follow-up questions.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.320]   Like I was drilling you on, right?
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.680]   You're just going to have everybody go around and then you just say, all right.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.360]   Thanks everybody.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.920]   I do those icebreakers so we can all meet somebody new.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.560]   Maybe I hope you'll say hello.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.920]   And then you as a host, shut up and you just let the party go, which is so
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.480]   awkward as a new host, if you've never done this, you're like, this is terrifying.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.560]   But then you do it and the room explodes.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.240]   It comes alive.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.040]   People go up and they talk to new people.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.720]   You turn the music back up and everybody's making these conversations.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.640]   So we do that because most parties you go to, you just, what?
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.760]   Like you went to your kid's birthday party recently.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.960]   They didn't do icebreakers.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.520]   You just, maybe you bumped into somebody and started the conversation.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.600]   I'm guessing, right?
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.240]   It's just physical proximity.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.080]   Don't let your kid drink that juice box.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.560]   Cause my daughter just threw it on the ground.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.720]   Like that was our icebreakers.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.720]   Yes.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.240]   Yes.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.400]   And there's nothing wrong with those.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.960]   Those are, those are fine gatherings, but for listeners of your show, they're
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.240]   interested in how to get more out of life.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.320]   They're interested in optimizing things.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.920]   And as cliche and as ridiculous as it sounds to optimize your social
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.440]   situations, it does help if the goal is to help your friends, make more friends.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.040]   To do a survey of the room, do a couple of them during your party to give
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:49.320]   people excuses to go start a new conversation because by the way, the
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.440]   other reason we do icebreakers is it gives people an easy excuse
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.640]   to end their conversations.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.520]   So are you doing these, like every 30 minutes, you kind of pop in, do
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.800]   an icebreaker and then turn it off.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.960]   That's exactly right.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.080]   You do them every 30 minutes.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.240]   You're going to do them three times.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:09.960]   So your part two or three times, and they should only take five or so minutes.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.200]   By the way, a hack that everybody needs to know the icebreakers.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.640]   You have to be standing.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.840]   You cannot let people sit down.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.480]   It is the kryptonite to a successful.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.600]   You can't do icebreakers sitting down.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.960]   People will ask follow-up questions.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.960]   They'll drone on a good icebreaker is a fast one.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.240]   You said you go from green to yellow to red.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.680]   What are the more advanced ones?
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.040]   And do you have people because people are coming, going, do you, do you
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.800]   redo the names and the works each time?
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.480]   Yes, you redo the names.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.760]   You do that for all of them.
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.520]   So your first icebreaker, I'll get into the details with you.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.280]   Your first icebreaker you're going to do when there's only five
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.680]   or six people who've shown up.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.760]   And that is what I call lovingly the awkward zone at a party.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.640]   It's the first 10 or 20 minutes when not many people are there.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.360]   It's a little bit awkward.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.640]   There's not enough energy in the room.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.160]   You do the icebreaker to bust out of the awkward zone.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.080]   You're going to do that same icebreaker about 20 minutes later
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.720]   when now everybody has arrived.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.280]   And then 30 minutes later, you'll do your last and final icebreaker.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.760]   And what I like to ask is say your name, say what you do for work.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:21.280]   And then say one of the favorite pieces of media that you've consumed
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.640]   over the last couple months, that could be a show on Netflix.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.400]   It could be a podcast like this.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.600]   It could be a great book that you read, a long form article, a
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.480]   funny meme that you saw, a Tik Tok video, just a cool piece of
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.000]   media that you consumed and enjoyed.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.440]   And Chris, this one works so well because everybody's sharing great
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.760]   recommendations for a book, a movie, something, and people are
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.000]   wanting to write down stuff.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.120]   They're feeling smarter because everybody's sharing these great ideas.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:49.960]   So I love that one.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.320]   What about that middle break?
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.720]   Any other tips for icebreakers beyond the two you shared?
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.760]   One more that you could do.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.080]   And this is, you've probably seen this online use for engagement bait is
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.520]   one of what is one of your favorite purchases of the last year?
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.560]   It could be a service or an activity, or it could be a physical
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.040]   object that you've purchased.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:08.920]   Maybe it's a new car.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.680]   Maybe it's a kitchen appliance, but what's one of your favorite purchases
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.480]   that's made your life better during the last year and people love to show.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.880]   I love this one.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.640]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.640]   I don't know.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.800]   I don't think I have any other questions.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.400]   Are you using a, oh, there's one more thing.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.240]   Can I tell you about this?
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.120]   Okay.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.040]   Reminder messages.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.480]   You need to do three reminder messages leading up to your
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.560]   party to keep it top of mind.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.000]   And you'll send those reminder messages.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   One of them, one week before the party, simple message.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.520]   Hey everybody.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:39.880]   What's up?
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.080]   Excited to have you guys over.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.000]   We'll see you next week on Wednesday night at 5:00 PM.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.400]   More details to come.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:45.920]   Okay.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.520]   The next one you'll send is three days before your party.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:55.480]   And for that one, you're going to use something I call guest bios and guest
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.280]   bios you're going to do for half or more of your attendees.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.040]   It's a brief blurb about your guests.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.160]   So for me, it could be Nick gray recently moved to Austin, Texas.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.920]   He lived in New York for 13 years.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.600]   Ask him about green tea.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.680]   Right.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.760]   It's, it's a quick little blurb or summary that you could pull from their
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.680]   LinkedIn or their Instagram or something like that, and it doesn't have to be a
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:21.440]   hundred percent, right?
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.040]   You're not asking for permission from other people to get this right.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.400]   You're just writing some stuff to give these conversational access
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.600]   points and also to get them locked into attending and to give those sort
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:39.320]   of introverts or shy people an idea of who's going to be there and an idea of
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.840]   who they might want to talk to and to raise the excitement of all the other
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.520]   people as well, but not everyone, just a few people, you don't have to do it.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:46.920]   Everyone.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.440]   What I suggest is half or more.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.760]   I'm more focused on the minimum.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.160]   Don't don't do any less than half.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.240]   So if you have 16 people coming, you need to do the minimum of eight, but
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.440]   don't feel that you have to do every single person I generally feel more is
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.240]   better, but don't feel like it has to be work.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.120]   You know, you're not going to spend an hour writing this thing.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.840]   It's just a quick little blurb.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.440]   I think I got it handled.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.800]   I think I'm ready to go.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.240]   Any follow-up after do you try to get feedback on how it went?
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:14.880]   Yes.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.840]   So right before you do your third round of icebreakers, you are
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.640]   going to do a group photo, right?
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.520]   A quick selfie.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.200]   What's up, everybody.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.640]   Turn around and take a selfie real quick.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.120]   Okay.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.680]   Group photo the next morning.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.680]   You will send them a thank you message.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.880]   Thanks everybody for coming.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.000]   You include everybody on BCC.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.320]   Thank you guys all for coming.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.280]   Um, can I invite you next time?
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:35.600]   Right?
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.320]   Simple question.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.440]   That's easy for them to say yes to, and you attach the group photo.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.000]   That's it.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.400]   That's all that you do.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.200]   Yes, you can do surveys.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.000]   That's an advanced level move.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.880]   I don't recommend it yet.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.440]   Um, but yes, surveys are helpful as you start to host more.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.080]   Any other advanced moves for people who are hearing this and they're
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.120]   like, no, no, I'm ready for them.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:55.480]   Now.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.800]   Oh gosh.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.120]   I hesitate to say this, but yes, I will tell your listeners, but
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.440]   please don't do this first.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.040]   Please do not do this first.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:03.760]   Okay.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.400]   A popular theme theme that you can do.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.000]   I'm trying to teach.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.280]   And I wrote this book and all this stuff that I'm sharing, because this
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.800]   is an operating system to run events.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.280]   You can use it at kids' birthday parties.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.840]   You can use it at a lot of different type of events.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.760]   For your first one, just do a cocktail party.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.960]   Don't try to get fancy.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.120]   One that is an absolute banger.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:32.200]   Huge success is for your neighbors and friends to do a book swap.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.760]   Everybody likes books.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.040]   Everybody has extra books they want to get rid of.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.720]   Everybody likes to get new books.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.000]   A book swap is so easy.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.960]   You use the same exact formula name, what you do for work, but maybe
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.920]   instead of something else you'd say, and tell us about one of
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.920]   the books that you brought, right?
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.280]   Why is it a great book?
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.280]   This book swap thing, I'm telling you, I've had people do it and it's
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.800]   their most well-attended event.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   So that's a good one.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.480]   Um, you can host a clothing swap.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.520]   I have a formula for hosting a clothing swap.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.400]   All of these things that you can do, you can do more thematic ones if you want,
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.800]   but those are sort of advanced level.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.880]   Get the formula first.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.280]   Most people have never run an icebreaker before.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:22.600]   And so one key thing, can I tell you about how to run a good icebreaker?
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.680]   So here's a key thing.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.400]   A lot of people don't like icebreakers because the hosts will be like, all
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.560]   right, we're going to do an icebreaker.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.320]   Say your name and what you do.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.880]   And the worst first date you ever went on Chris, you go first, right?
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.680]   It's like terrible.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:37.280]   It's so bad.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   I hate the worst first date is a red.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.880]   That's a good example of a red level question where there's not enough
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.000]   rapport built up among people yet.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.640]   So we wouldn't do that one, but a good icebreaker always has the host go first.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:57.200]   Ask permission for who can go next and then indicate to the group, which
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.120]   way the round of icebreakers would go.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:04.120]   So as an example, if I was setting up the icebreaker, I would say, all right, so
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.480]   now we're going to do this round of icebreakers, you're going to say your
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.240]   name, what you do for work, and one of your favorite things for breakfast.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:15.600]   I will go first and then looking to my left, Chris, uh, can we go to you next?
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   And hopefully you'll say yes.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.520]   I'll say great.
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.680]   So I will go first.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.440]   We'll go to Chris next, and then we're going to go around the circle this way.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.400]   Um, it sounds childish.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:31.560]   It sounds like I'm a clown telling multiple times the instructions
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.000]   and which way to go around, but it just makes the instructions crystal clear.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:40.400]   It makes it run fast and it gives power to those, I don't know,
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.960]   those people with social anxiety.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.760]   I dated a woman who had a lot of social anxiety and she said, the more
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.240]   that I could know which way it was going, the less surprises, the better.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.400]   Unfortunately, you are coming to San Francisco soon, but not later.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.400]   So you won't, you won't get to see me do this in action, but I
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.560]   will let you know how it goes.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.160]   And, uh, you know, we'll, we'll maybe save some of those
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.400]   advanced tactics for later.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.440]   Um, one more, I'm going to give one, um, one last thing.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.920]   Uh, when you do your round of icebreakers, I want your wife to stand next to you.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:15.840]   And I want her to, to talk too much so that you can actually kind of cut her off.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.760]   And why do you want to do that?
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:22.040]   Because then you can signal to everybody else that we're not going to use these
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.760]   icebreakers to drone on and on and talk too long.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.360]   You can cut her off first.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.800]   People will laugh a little bit.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.640]   And I think, or she can go first and cut me off.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.840]   She could go first, but then she needs to facilitate it.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.080]   And she needs to be the one who is the facilitator.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.200]   So, yes, absolutely.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:38.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.160]   There's nothing worse than doing icebreakers and one person talks forever.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.720]   So I'm, I'm a big fan of finding a way to politely show people that this is
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.800]   not a time to give a presentation.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.640]   Yes.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:49.960]   Yes.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.320]   And sometimes we have to do that.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:55.360]   We have to be, we have to lead a party with generous authority.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.640]   And that means that what is best for the whole group is not always
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.880]   being ultra polite to one person.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.720]   So with a successful cocktail party, what do you think?
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.760]   What do you hope people feel after it?
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.160]   And what, what, what kind of comes out of this whole experience?
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:13.120]   A successful cocktail party has the energy in the room, very high.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.880]   And somebody leaves your party saying, wow, that was like the best party.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.320]   That was awesome.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.640]   And it's so simple.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.320]   I got a message from a woman who just read my book and she hosted a
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.280]   party with name tags and icebreakers.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.960]   And she said that night, she and her husband got multiple text
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.760]   messages from friends saying that it was the best party that they'd ever thrown.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:33.360]   Why?
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.240]   Because they just added a little structure to it.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.720]   So what's the feeling?
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:41.600]   It's that feeling that when you're done hosting, you say that
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.640]   was awesome and that was also easy.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.680]   Like I could do that again, because I think we've all hosted parties where
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.800]   we're absolutely drained afterwards.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.880]   And while it may have been a success, we never want to do it again.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.360]   What's the energy that your guests have?
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.560]   It's that they, they met so many people.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.880]   They, they had a really great time.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.280]   You let them go early, right?
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.480]   They didn't feel like they had to, Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.400]   We have to sleep at no you're telling them.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.040]   They got to go get out of here.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.360]   You're ending it while it's going great.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.920]   Uh, yeah, it's just, I can talk about this all day.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.720]   I want to turn to talk about this business.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.160]   You started museum hack and my understanding is you started a little
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:24.000]   accidentally and you became a lover of museums, not intentionally.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.960]   And you probably started on the other end of the spectrum.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.120]   How did this all come about?
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.320]   Yeah, I hate most museums.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:33.160]   I think they're really boring and they just don't have anything to do with me.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.040]   I'm not, I didn't grow up going to museums.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:35.760]   I think they're stupid.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.600]   Um, however, I, I lived in New York city where they had the
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.240]   metropolitan museum of art and it's a big museum.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.080]   Have you been to the Met?
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:43.760]   I haven't.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.680]   Okay.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.240]   It's enormous.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.960]   It's the most popular museum in America.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.200]   It's 2.3 million square feet.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.520]   It takes up 11 acres of central park.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.440]   It's enormous and it's overwhelming.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.400]   And for many New Yorkers, it's just a tourist attraction.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.320]   It's not a place they have a relationship with.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.760]   Uh, this woman brought me there on a romantic date and she showed me
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.440]   things and she talked to me at my level, which I have like a third grade reading
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:11.960]   level, and so she just sort of talked to me like, wow, look at these Egyptian
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.600]   artifacts, sculpture, furniture, paintings.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:19.000]   And so I started to go back to the museum because I was like, I think I moved in
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.240]   New York to hang out at places like this.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.640]   And so I'd go to the museum and just explore.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.040]   I'd look things up on Wikipedia.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:29.360]   I'd watch YouTube videos and I started to do these tours for my friends, just
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.080]   showing them around when they'd come visit.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:36.320]   And they became like a, a, a famous thing because my tours were basically
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.800]   10 cool things I found and three things I wanted to steal.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:45.440]   Uh, not like a narrative arc of, of art history, just cool stuff I found.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:50.720]   And then it became very famous and celebrities started to come and I hired
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.520]   some tour guides to lead the tours.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:57.400]   And what was special was Museum Hack would hire Broadway actors and
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:01.920]   standup comedians to be the tour guides instead of the museum volunteers.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.840]   And they would work for me, not for the museum.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:09.480]   And so they would tell the juicy backstories about the art, about how
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.240]   much the art cost, about stories of the donors, things like that,
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.720]   that people wanted to hear.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.840]   And so that was our whole thing was attracting new audiences
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.560]   into these storied museums.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:25.000]   And what did you learn about how to see a museum?
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Like, you know, I'm obviously people can go take a museum hack tour, which
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.080]   is still running as a business, but, uh, I'm so fascinated as someone who.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:39.160]   I don't know if I, I, I could tell if someone asked me the
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.040]   question, how do you do a museum?
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.200]   I don't feel like I would have the answer you would.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.640]   And I feel like you have a better answer.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.480]   I'll tell your listeners exactly how to visit a museum.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.520]   And they're in San Francisco.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.880]   Have you been to the Legion of Honor?
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:50.520]   I have.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:51.960]   It's a nice museum, right?
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.840]   That one in the D young are two really nice museums there.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.200]   Um, so here's how to visit.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.000]   Here's exactly from all my time.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.280]   And I've been to the metropolitan museum of art more than a thousand
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.880]   times, and I've been to many other museums.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:09.360]   Here is how you should go about experiencing a museum for the first time.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.440]   So you're going to a new museum, any museum, or is it, you know, specific
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.880]   categories work better than others for this, uh, this applies to any museum.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:24.320]   Museum hack, in my opinion, works best for art museums, but the thing, the
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:28.720]   hack, the special sauce I'm about to tell you the way to approach works for any
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.760]   museum, and here's what you're going to do.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:35.040]   As soon as you get there, you're going to go in right where you buy your ticket.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.040]   You'll get a map and you are going to walk the entire floor
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.440]   plan and you're not going to stop.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.480]   You're not going to stop and look at it.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.680]   I don't care if you love it.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.520]   You're not going to stop.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.280]   You can circle it on the map and you'll come back later, but
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.520]   you're not going to stop.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:55.680]   You're going to walk the entire floor plan to build a mental map of the
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:59.440]   space and to know where you want to go back to later.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.400]   So first you'll walk the entire floor plan.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.520]   It could take you between five and 45 minutes, depending on how big it is.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.840]   You will then go to the museum cafe.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:12.360]   Almost all museums have a cafe.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.840]   If they don't have a cafe, you can just sit down and you're
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.920]   going to take a little break.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.120]   I like to go there and I like to get a cup of coffee.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.320]   You can get a glass of wine if you want, and you get a little snack.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:27.240]   You're going to rip replenish your glycogen or your glucose or whatever.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:31.640]   You're just going to have some carbs, maybe some sugar to build up your energy
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:37.600]   store, to go back now that you've seen everything briefly, you will now go back
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.760]   and look closer at the things that captured your mind and interest.
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.080]   What happens to many people?
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.200]   Why we do this is have you ever done this?
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:49.720]   You go to a new museum and you spend like the first hour looking at the
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.640]   stuff that you happen to just walk like.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:59.840]   You waste all of your cognitive load and, and, and looking energy on things
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.400]   that you don't even want to look at because the best stuff sometimes
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.440]   is at the very end, the stuff that you're most excited about.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.400]   And by the time you get to that stuff, you're tired and you're exhausted.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.400]   So the way to do it is to walk through the entire floor plan.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.640]   Do not stop at anything.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:17.080]   Circle things on the map, go to the cafe, take a break, and then go back
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.240]   and look closer and deeper at the things you're curious about.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.720]   And how long does that usually take?
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.800]   Would you say for, I know there are museums of different sizes, but how
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.360]   long would you tell someone to budget for a trip to a museum?
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.880]   I personally can't spend more than two hours.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.600]   I think that this was one of the biggest things that I changed a lot of my
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:39.360]   friends thinking about is that you don't have to go try to get every single
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.320]   dollars worth and stay there as long as possible.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.480]   I can spend about two hours at a museum before I get tired.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:48.320]   This is a real thing, getting tired at a museum.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.520]   It's called gallery fatigue.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:54.440]   It happens because we're not in an activated space.
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:55.200]   We're quiet.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.880]   We're thinking, we don't know how we're supposed to act.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.400]   It can be stressful sometimes.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.280]   So I spent, I spent about two hours total.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:06.600]   So about half that time is a run through and a cafe.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.600]   And then the other half is actually kind of spending time in
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.680]   the things you're interested in.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.200]   Yes.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:11.480]   Yes.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.560]   Sometimes if I go to a museum for two hours, I'll spend an hour in the cafe.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:20.400]   Because I just want to go approach it with a strip, with a strategy.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.240]   And many times we don't have a strategy.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:26.160]   When we go into a new physical space, like a museum, we're just walking where
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.200]   our body takes us and we're looking.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.480]   And before we know it, we've wasted an hour and we're tired.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:34.640]   And we didn't even get to go see the really cool stuff that's on the
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.280]   second floor back in the modern way.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.320]   And could you do that from the map at home or do you need to be there?
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.440]   I think you need to be there because you need to walk it.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.720]   You need to physically get in your body and see the stuff firsthand.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:51.720]   And also there's not going to be, the museum's not going to feature like
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.520]   all, like you may be interested.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.200]   Like, for example, I love at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:01.240]   There's this sofa, it's like a green, beautiful green sofa.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:05.920]   It's not going to be on any of the museum website or featured top galleries.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.440]   I don't know why I like it, but it was owned by the King of Spain or something.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:10.880]   And I love that thing.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.960]   And you're not going to find that when you do the museum's
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.560]   website tour of the galleries.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:17.880]   Do you have some favorite museums from just, you know, you probably, if you've
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:21.120]   been to the Met a thousand times, I imagine you've been to, you know, when
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.840]   you're in a new city, I feel like you're probably like, how could you help
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.560]   yourself from going to check out a new museum?
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.480]   Yeah, I love to go to new museums.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.320]   So the Metropolitan Museum of Art is my favorite in the whole world.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:34.080]   And it's what's called an encyclopedic museum.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.320]   That means there's many different galleries and curatorial departments.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.280]   So I love encyclopedic museums, maybe similar to the Legion
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.880]   of Honor there in San Francisco.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.680]   In Washington, DC, I like the National Gallery.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.800]   I like the enormous big museums because they have a
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.280]   little something for everyone.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.960]   And using my strategy, maybe will help your visitors approach these really big
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.080]   museums that can be so intimidating.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.120]   To feel like you don't have to get it all in at once.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.160]   You don't have to like, it's okay to leave and not see everything.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.840]   What about deals on going to museums?
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:14.760]   I feel like, you know, running museum hack while the whole brand wasn't
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.520]   getting a deal on getting into museums.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.960]   What have you found in that space?
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.200]   For deals, I could tell you how to beat the line.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.120]   So I can tell people how to skip the line.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.560]   Deals, it's really, Oh yes.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.200]   Oh my God.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.280]   Wait, I completely forgot.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.000]   I have the best deal ever.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   I've won.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:30.760]   Oh my God.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:31.480]   I have the best.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.200]   I hope I'm not blowing out my mic levels being too loud.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.720]   I have the best hack ever.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.840]   And don't put this in the show notes.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:44.440]   There is a membership called the American Alliance of Museums.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:48.960]   It's essentially an industry trade group for museums in America.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:53.040]   You can join as a non-employee.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.520]   It's called a friend of the association or something.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.480]   It's called AAM American Alliance of Museums.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:04.480]   You can join as a friend of the association for under a hundred dollars per year.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:11.280]   It will grant you access, a free ticket to almost every single museum in America.
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.280]   Wow.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.960]   Do not blow up my spot.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:14.920]   Don't blow up my spot.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.520]   American Alliance of Museums.
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.800]   It's like the friend membership or something.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.320]   It should be a hundred dollars or less.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:23.040]   And me and my friends have done this for many years.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.680]   Now you should also support, if you're listening to museums, I'm not trying
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:31.320]   to scam people out of how to pay for these culture institutions
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.840]   that largely are underfunded.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:37.480]   I want to tell you about this though, so that you feel like you can go to a museum
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.280]   for an hour and fall in love with it.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.560]   And you can go multiple times.
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:44.280]   You can buy this and go to the Legion of Honor for 45 minutes.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:47.120]   And hopefully you'll fall in love with it and buy a membership
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.480]   and support it in other ways.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.960]   What about skipping the lines?
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.760]   You said there was another thing for skipping the lines.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:57.640]   Some museums, so for skipping the lines, some museums have additional entrances.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:01.920]   Major museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art will have an education
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.160]   entrance that's for school groups and other things at the Metropolitan
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:11.280]   Museum in New York City, there is almost always an enormous line out the main
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:16.360]   entrance, but no line at the education entrance doesn't mean you have to be
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.400]   part of a school group to use that entrance.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.960]   You can just go in and buy a ticket like normal.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.840]   That's another hack.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:23.880]   Love it.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:29.280]   The one hack I want to share and it's, uh, it's not for everyone literally
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:34.280]   because it's, it's a Capital One related deal right now, but I mentioned
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:38.200]   this in the last episode, but since this is all about museums, if you
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:43.360]   have a Capital One card, I think for almost the next year, it's until June
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:47.760]   2024, I think you can with any Capital One membership, get a six month
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:52.640]   membership to this site called the Cultivist, which gives you and three
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.240]   guests access to a hundred museums around the world, I know it includes
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:00.640]   the Louvre, the Guggenheim, the MoMA, um, and a lot more.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.120]   So you, after that six months, you have to pay $40 a month.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.920]   So, you know, if you like it and you want to keep going, great.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:10.400]   But there is a six month free membership that I'd recommend anyone
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.040]   with a Capital One card, check out.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:12.800]   Great one.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.960]   And then the other one, I can't remember if I've talked about this
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:21.880]   before, but I didn't realize that joining museums as a member is in many
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:25.000]   cases, not much more expensive than just going.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:30.120]   Um, and this is especially true if you have friends or family in town.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:34.600]   Um, you know, we, the Academy of Sciences in San Francisco is a cool museum.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:39.120]   We had a bunch of people in town and it was actually, well, two things.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:42.440]   One, most museum memberships are all tax deductible donations.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.120]   Yes.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.840]   Most museum tickets are not.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:49.560]   So, uh, so if you ever see that thing where it's like, buy your ticket, you
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:54.000]   can apply the cost of your ticket to your, uh, to your membership, technically
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:58.960]   the ticket price is not a deductible contribution, but the incremental cost is.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:02.080]   So if you're going to join, join before you buy the tickets, but we looked
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:06.440]   into it and after you factor in the deduction you get for making a
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:10.120]   contribution, it was cheaper for us to buy a one-year membership to the Academy
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:14.320]   of Sciences, which allowed us a certain number of guests than it was to
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.280]   actually just buy the tickets the day of.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:21.080]   So, uh, in many cases that's true, which has now resulted in us being
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:26.000]   members of the Oakland zoo, the Academy of sciences, uh, a place called
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.400]   curiodicy, um, on the peninsula, which is kind of like half kids, science museum,
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.200]   half zoo.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.400]   So I feel like we're collecting memberships because it turns out that
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:39.000]   factoring in the cost, it actually ends up being about the same cost as going
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.400]   sometimes once, sometimes twice, but almost never more than two times.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.280]   It's really not that expensive.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.320]   You're exactly right to join at the lowest level for many of these
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.440]   institutions with unlimited membership.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:53.080]   I'll tell you something else for your listeners, a hack for many of these
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:58.000]   organizations, the biggest ones I'm talking about in major cities, New York,
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.880]   Chicago, DC, Seattle, Denver, big, big cities, their art museums, and sometimes
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:11.000]   science museums will have something called a young members program, young
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.240]   patrons program, something like that.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:23.000]   That typically goes after members 45 or 40 and younger and gives you extremely
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.680]   VIP access at a disturbingly discount rate.
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:31.000]   I'll give you an example in New York city at the metropolitan museum of art.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.960]   Uh, there was something called the Apollo circle group.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.880]   That was a thousand dollars a year.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.600]   Now you might think, wow, that is expensive.
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:43.880]   It is expensive for some people that gave you once a month after
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.320]   hours parties at the museum.
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:51.240]   With incredible past appetizers, open bar, private tours from the
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:57.120]   curators, insane level of access that for older members, they were
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:00.040]   charging five, 10, 15, $20,000 a year.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:04.800]   But they subsidize this for young people, hoping that you will develop a long-term
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.680]   relationship and donate a lot more.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:11.480]   So young patrons programs at these museums, the key word would be to ask
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.840]   if you're looking to, to buy a membership and you're curious about
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:18.520]   this, say, Oh, what type of young patrons memberships might you have?
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.800]   And then I forgot about bank of America.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.360]   If you have a bank of America card, I think the first weekend of every month,
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.680]   you can go to a ton of museums around the country for free.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:31.840]   I know in San Francisco, it includes the Legion of honor and
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:36.440]   the DeYoung museum and that, that, so, um, even like a free bank of America
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:39.800]   checking account would, would I think qualify if I remember correctly.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:44.160]   So, uh, that's another one I'll link to that in the show notes with museum hack.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.560]   You probably talked to lots of people and learned a lot about
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.280]   planning tours, booking tours.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:52.120]   What do you do if you're in a new country and you want to find a tour?
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.240]   Do you have a way to do that?
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.280]   That that cuts through the noise and finds the best tours.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:03.160]   I'll tell you right now, the people that are killing it are Airbnb experiences.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.240]   Have you done an Airbnb experience?
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:09.200]   I we've done a bunch of virtual ones that were kind of like company
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:14.120]   organized events, COVID, uh, no way you got to do the real in-person
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:18.720]   Airbnb experience, and I would even challenge you to set up a date night
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:24.320]   with your wife and do one of them in San Francisco, uh, on the Airbnb experiences.
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:28.280]   The problem is now they're spamming them a lot with these photo things
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:31.560]   where they're just trying to juice for photos, skip all of those.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:35.040]   I'm looking for food tours and walking tours that have an
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.160]   average rating above 4.9 with at least 25 reviews.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.680]   Those are generally, you're going to get some really good tour guides.
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:47.840]   And what I like about that is they're empowered tour guides that
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.520]   have set up their own businesses that are going to be very passionate.
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:54.200]   So I like Airbnb experiences and I will generally schedule it.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.720]   The first thing I do to a city, cause then I can ask the guide for advice.
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:02.800]   This show isn't usually a show about someone's kind of stories,
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.560]   their resume and that kind of stuff.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.440]   And so normally I was going to skip over the career stuff in favor of all
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.040]   these tactical things we've talked about.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.480]   Uh, but I looked at, I was like, Oh, you sold your company.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:12.960]   Cool.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.640]   You know, a lot of shows would be like, tell me about that.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.560]   I wasn't that interested for the purpose of this show.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.840]   And then I saw that it was actually a very interesting
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.720]   way you sold your company.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.920]   Um, something that I think most people probably as business owners
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.760]   wouldn't think of, and most people as employees wouldn't think of.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:33.800]   And so I would love to just hear the quick version of that and how it's gone.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.800]   Because I thought it was something that at least one person listening
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.040]   might get a lot out of hearing.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:38.920]   Yes.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:44.840]   I sold my last company, museum hack to my then CEO and marketing director.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:47.800]   They came to me with an offer to buy the business.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.200]   I never thought that I would sell it.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:52.280]   I just, I didn't, it didn't seem like a business you could really sell to
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:57.440]   somebody and I sold it to them using seller financing, which what that means
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.560]   is that they put zero money down.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:03.120]   And they said, look, we're just going to run the business like we've been doing.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.680]   And yet we will pay you off over five years from all the profits.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.280]   So you get to lock in five years of profits of the business
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.400]   and have zero responsibility.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.720]   And so that's how I sold the business.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.040]   And they've, they've done so much better than I ever could have done.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.800]   They've taken the business to new places and it was a big win for everybody.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:23.920]   There's an episode.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.960]   I think you've done on a podcast about it that I listened to briefly.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.760]   I'll link to that in the show notes, but I just thought it was a cool story
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.960]   because most small business kind of sales, nobody really talks about how
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.360]   that works and this was a different one.
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.040]   Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:43.360]   It was super, um, it was super unique and it now would give me the opportunity
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.760]   to do a lot of traveling myself, which I do have some questions for you about
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.800]   traveling myself whenever it's appropriate.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.400]   Okay.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:50.840]   Yeah, no, no.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.480]   My, my, I had some travel stuff I wanted to jump into.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.600]   Cause you know, you have this great website where you've
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.960]   blogged about all these adventures.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.040]   So, but I'll let you jump in first and let's see where it goes.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:05.440]   Fun fact, a friend of mine just flew back last night from, um, um, Istanbul.
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.080]   And have you gone through their new lounge there?
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.360]   Have you been through the new Istanbul airport?
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.560]   I'm going to assume.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.800]   No, I think it was, it's been a long time.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:19.720]   It is the biggest airport business lounge in the whole world.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.040]   And it is absolutely incredible.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.080]   And he and I were just sharing stories about that.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:25.640]   Okay.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.560]   Here's my questions.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:26.880]   Okay.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.160]   So I have a question for you.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.320]   Is it ever cheaper to buy a round trip plane ticket?
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.000]   I love to book one way plane tickets.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.400]   I think it's the greatest luxury in the world.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:41.040]   I don't set myself a determined date to come back.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.600]   I kind of love to go to places and I'll go back when I'm bored.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.440]   Am I shooting myself in the foot and losing a lot of money?
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:54.040]   Or as I assume are one way is pretty much the same price as a round trip.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:58.840]   I would say domestic for the most part that is correct.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.720]   There are one, two, one ways is equal to a round trip.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:06.720]   I was actually looking for flights to fly from San Francisco to steamboat
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.280]   Springs where my wife's family lives.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:14.960]   And I actually noticed that booking a round trip was cheaper by about $75.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.720]   You know, the total cost of the round trip was $75 less than two one ways.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:24.040]   But I also know that in the winter steamboat Springs helps subsidize
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.480]   the cost of flights there.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.720]   And I assume that part of that deal is we're going to help subsidize
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.480]   the flights for touristic purposes.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:35.240]   Most people buying one way tickets aren't flying for, uh, you know, tourism.
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.280]   They're more flying for business or, or they live there.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.200]   So I would say if there are places that are maybe small airports where they
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.200]   might be subsidized by the town for tourism reasons, you might actually
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.600]   still get a better deal buying round trip.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.160]   When it comes to international, there are a lot of circumstances
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.320]   where one way is, is.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.040]   Much more expensive than a round trip, or at least two one ways
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.320]   is more expensive than a round trip.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.760]   Um, the, the catch there is there's a few things.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:07.360]   So one, you could buy a round trip, set your return really far in the distant
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.680]   future, and you could actually look online and say, depending on the airline,
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.840]   what is their policy for cancellation and reusing the funds.
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.480]   And in those circumstances, I would say, let's say you wanted to fly on air
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.320]   France and you knew you, you weren't sure if you were going to come back.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.000]   There might be a way and.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.720]   Got to read a lot of the terms.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.680]   You could book a round trip, uh, and change the return later.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.320]   Uh, maybe book it on Delta instead of air France.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.080]   So if you got credit, it would be on Delta, which you might use more
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.600]   frequently living in the States than you would use an air France credit.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:43.320]   Um, or, and, and for anyone flying business class, it is often much
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.720]   cheaper to fly round trip business class than, uh, one, two one ways.
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.680]   But the fair is actually round trip.
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:52.080]   So I've helped a lot of people who are looking to fly one
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.320]   way business class to Europe.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.640]   Maybe they want to go to another city and come back from there.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:59.400]   You buy one way to Europe and business, and then you fly, but you buy a round
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.080]   trip and the return is in coach.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.480]   And so, you know, I remember a circumstance where it was like the one
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:11.440]   way ticket was $4,000, but the round trip with the outbound in business.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.120]   And the return in coach was like $2,300.
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.640]   So it was significantly cheaper if you bought a round trip, but you didn't
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.800]   have to buy the return in business.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.160]   So that's another circumstance.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.240]   If, if you're flying business that can help.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.680]   Um, but I would say if you, it might be cheaper, let's say you're going in the
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.800]   summer, you want a one-way ticket to Europe.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.120]   It might be cheaper to fly around trip, but summer is expensive, but you
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.520]   could always look to return, you know, maybe in January or some, some other
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.880]   month where it's a much cheaper time to travel, so I don't know if there's a
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.560]   hardened fast rule internationally on when, when it matters and when it doesn't.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.920]   And, uh, but I have seen that be the case.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.200]   There have been times where it's a case.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.840]   So I would kind of give you the advice of check and see.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.440]   Um, and if it's the same, then I would just book the one way.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.680]   Of course, that's smart.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.200]   I've, I've never thought about that idea.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:04.320]   What resonated the most with me is business one way and then coach back
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.360]   and see how that would go to the one way.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:10.440]   So similarly, the coach flight, because in Europe, any ticket you buy that you
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.360]   cancel, even if it's non-refundable, you get your taxes back.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.600]   So the rule is, you know, you buy round trip business out coach back.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.280]   As soon as you fly the business leg, you cancel the ticket and you get
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.720]   your taxes on the coach leg back.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:25.320]   I like that, especially through airports like London Heathrow, where
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.160]   the taxes can be almost $200.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.000]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:28.960]   Okay.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.680]   Next question.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:33.000]   Um, I like having flight optionality, right.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.280]   As my first question alluded.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:39.280]   And so I love to book plane tickets where I can get a full refund very easily.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.160]   For that reason, I tend to book Southwest a lot.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.000]   Are there other airlines now post COVID?
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.680]   Does everybody give you full refunds on flights or let's just
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.120]   assume domestic only for now?
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:54.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.080]   So Southwest, if you book with points, it's like full refund
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.240]   and points get redeposited.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:02.440]   If you book with dollars, you get a Southwest travel credit.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.960]   You don't get a full refund.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.600]   Um, unless you, I believe there's a new fare.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.200]   Uh, actually no, and that credit has to be used by you.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.560]   Southwest just launched this, like want to get away plus fare.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.320]   And the, the main selling perk is that that credit you get
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.520]   back can be used by anyone.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:23.880]   Um, but most of the airlines have now moved to a similar model where if you
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.200]   cancel something, you'll get a credit back.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:30.360]   Um, I don't have the list off the top of my head of which ones are doing that,
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:33.760]   which ones aren't, and when you book with miles, some of them still charge
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.600]   a fee to deposit those miles back if you cancel it, but many do not.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:42.560]   Um, so I would say the most flexibility, you know, with Southwest, if I know
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:47.120]   I'm not gonna, I know I might need to make a change versus like, this
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.440]   is a trip I'm definitely taking.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.120]   I try to book with points because they'll just refund the points
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.120]   instead of give you a credit.
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:56.680]   Um, so that's the move, but yeah, I think miles give you a lot of
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:00.160]   flexibility because let's say I'm booking an international trip.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.160]   That's tons of miles for a family of four.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:07.080]   They might charge you even a $50 a person redeposit fee, but I'd rather
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:14.000]   pay $50 times for people, you know, to get my miles back then have a $5,000
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.360]   credit on, you know, KLM or something, which is going to be really hard to use.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960]   Super hard to use.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.760]   Uh, so that leads me to my next question.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:27.760]   I do book with Southwest and I do book with Southwest points because I just
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.600]   want it as easy as possible to cancel.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:35.440]   I generally just transfer my chase points one to one to Southwest just
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.400]   cause it's easy and it's built in.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.960]   I have a bunch of chase points.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.200]   Is that stupid?
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.000]   Am I being stupid by just doing those one-to-one to Southwest or what?
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.720]   You're traveling and you're getting to go on trips.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.120]   So I wouldn't say any of these choices are stupid, right?
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.760]   Like I always say, if you can use your points to go on a free trip, uh, you
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.120]   know, you're doing something right.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:01.640]   However, I will say that, you know, the way Southwest airlines works is that
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:06.960]   their points are effectively worth like a dollar value, it fluctuates a little
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.760]   bit, but it's roughly around, I think it's like 1.37 cents per point.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.880]   Um, so that's the bar, like you'll never get more.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.880]   You'll never get less.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.280]   It's kind of right hovers around there.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.520]   If you use your chase points and you have a chase Sapphire reserve card and you
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:28.240]   just book in the chase portal, you can book any flight on any carrier, probably
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:31.880]   except Southwest, uh, because Southwest doesn't like to play with all these
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.160]   travel portals, but you can book any flight on any carrier and your
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.840]   points will be worth 1.5 cents.
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:39.960]   So your points are going to go further on any other carrier booking in the
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.760]   chase portal than they will on Southwest.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.720]   Now that doesn't mean it's going to be as easy to cancel.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.880]   If you do that, it might not be as convenient for you, but from a pure
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.880]   dollar value of the point, you know, my stack rank is transferred to Southwest
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.040]   near the bottom because the value trans book in the portal, and then, you know,
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.520]   I I'll refer you to a few episodes when we wrap up where we kind of go in more
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.560]   detail, but when you take those points and you transfer them to almost any other
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:14.600]   airline, Air France, uh, United, you know, you can get 1 cent, but you can also
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:17.920]   sometimes if you time it right, if you're booking last minute, if you're flying
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:21.680]   an international business class, you know, I've seen, I've gotten 5 cents, I've
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:27.480]   gotten 7 cents, so I would say you're getting free trips and I want you to
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.400]   take vacations.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:32.680]   That's like, it makes me happy, but your points could be where it could probably
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.760]   be earning you more value, uh, than they are by transferring to Southwest.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:41.640]   Speaking of international travel, what is your jet lag strategy?
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:47.280]   So I typically try to get on the time zone, like 24 hours in advance.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:52.360]   I try to like, you know, you get on this plane and you're using your miles.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.240]   You'd say you're flying in business and you're like, oh, they're going to give
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.680]   me this amazing meal and these free bottles of wine.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.360]   And I'm like, but it's about 10 30 PM in Tokyo.
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.280]   So I'm going to bed.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.560]   I'm not drinking.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:06.080]   I'm not, you know, I'm trying to hydrate so that, um, you know, I can get good
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.880]   night's rest land.
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:12.440]   I try to power through as long as I can till the end of the day and go to sleep.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.680]   And I'd say like 70% of the time it works.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.840]   Every now and then I remember one night, one afternoon, my wife and I were in
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:23.280]   Budapest and we were like, let's just take a nap, like, you know, 2:00 PM.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.760]   Just a quick one.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.040]   And then, you know, you wake up at 4:00 AM and you're like, oh,
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.560]   we just, we're really screwed here.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.160]   Oh God.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:34.080]   Um, but for most part, I try to get on the time zone a day in advance and.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:39.480]   You know, not worry about the plane ride and the experience as much as like
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.880]   trying to get on the right time zone.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.360]   I have not yet done a trip like that, changing more than a
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.560]   time zone or two with children.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.560]   And so anyone listening has tips there.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.800]   I would absolutely love you to send me an email because we're talking about
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.800]   taking a trip where we'd go more than four or five time zones with two kids.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.280]   And I have no idea what that will be like.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:03.640]   I have used an app that is called time shifter.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:04.600]   Have you heard of this app?
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:04.920]   No.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.640]   Time shifter is a fascinating app.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.640]   You can use it the first time for free.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.640]   And then after that, I think it's $9 a trip.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:16.320]   And they use the same science that NASA uses when they send astronauts up to
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:21.440]   the international space station by doing exactly what you said, but just a little
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:26.080]   more strategically of trying to get you on the new time zone, starting about two
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:30.840]   days in advance, what does that look like each day they'll have you wake up an hour
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.080]   sooner, each day they'll throttle back.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.600]   The last time you're allowed to have caffeine, they're going to do certain
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:43.520]   things to modulate your behaviors in the two days leading up to your trip.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:48.840]   And then on the flight itself, sometimes, like you said, they feed you all this.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.640]   They try to get you drunk.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.400]   They try to get you to go to sleep, but sometimes that's not what they're doing
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.960]   in the times when you're flying too.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.000]   And they'll tell you advice, like open up your window shade, turn
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.240]   your phone brightness to a hundred percent, get light in your eyes.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:06.880]   You need to get your body sync during the flight itself.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.680]   I think that's an interesting app.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.160]   I'll have to check it out.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.960]   My next question is away from travel.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:16.640]   You mentioned a couple of times during this interview that you have an au pair.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:21.320]   Do you feel comfortable talking about the decision process that went
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.520]   into as a family, making that jump?
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:28.880]   I, I didn't grow up with people who had au pairs.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:34.760]   I now know friends who have them, but for some, it could feel very inaccessible.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:38.840]   And I was just curious what, how you came to that family choice.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.880]   So I did grow up my parents.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.240]   We had four au pairs from Norway when I was a kid.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:49.200]   So, uh, you know, I just, we grew up in DC, uh, suburbs and I think, you
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.560]   know, DC is a very international place.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.040]   I seemed so normal at the time.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.200]   I can't actually say whether like my friends had au pairs,
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.200]   but I thought it was so cool.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.680]   I brought my au pair to show and tell in school one year.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.080]   That's incredible.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:06.160]   And then my wife, Amy and I, we travel differently, I guess.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:10.040]   So we took an eight month trip backpacking and we couch surf the whole time.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:15.240]   And before we left, we wanted to like build up credibility on couch surfing the app.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.840]   And so we hosted probably 50 people over the course of six months in our house.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:27.440]   And so for us, the idea of having someone from another country around us, um, or
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.720]   staying in someone else's home, we don't know when we're traveling, uh, was just
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.480]   like something we've done, I don't know, hundreds of times.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.120]   And so I love it.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:39.880]   I think there's nothing more interesting than meeting people from different
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.640]   walks of life, different parts of the world, hearing their stories, having
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.920]   meals with them, cooking meals for them.
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:49.800]   I remember trying to find all the ingredients I needed to make eggplant
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.560]   Parmesan, uh, in rural Tanzania.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:57.960]   Uh, in this house where all we had was like a pot and, you know, a little
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.640]   carrier, you know, uh, what did you propane stove and I remember I was so
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.880]   proud because I'd managed to find this international grocery store and Dara
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.520]   Salam and I found eggplant, I found mozzarella cheese and sauce and spaghetti.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.640]   I made this whole meal and I served it.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:17.640]   And the father of the house we were staying with was like, I'm so excited for
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:17.960]   dinner.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.400]   And I was like, we just ate dinner.
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:20.600]   He's like, oh no, no, that wasn't dinner.
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.280]   There was no meat.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.880]   And I was like, no, that was, that was Derek.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.320]   We had eggplant Parmesan, we had spaghetti.
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.720]   We had some garlic bread.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.680]   It was kind of garlic bread.
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.600]   And he was like, but there's no meat.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.600]   So it couldn't have been dinner.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.440]   And I was like, totally defeated.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.640]   But that experience was like just cooking that meal.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.040]   I might look at like a photo in the show notes.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:42.160]   Cause it's kind of, it's like, it was not a normal kitchen to cook this meal in.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.640]   Um, I should've gone with chicken Parmesan to be honest, but, uh, you know,
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.120]   that kind of stuff I love my wife loves, like we want our children to have
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.360]   experiences like that.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:57.840]   So the idea of having someone from another country who has a totally set a
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:02.160]   different set of background, different set of experiences come in and, you know,
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:06.120]   share that with you for a year, um, and, and get to know your family and get to
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.440]   show them around, you know, I've like, we've taken, um, our au pairs to visit
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:15.400]   family, to visit other cities and friends and, um, showing them around museums.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:19.960]   Uh, so for me, I think it, it just seemed like an obvious.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:26.680]   Great solution, but about half the people I tell, tell about it, tell it to about
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:30.480]   half the people I talk about it with are like, you have a random person
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.680]   living in your house for a year.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:37.600]   Like what for us, that just seems like it just totally reasonable and interesting.
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:41.640]   And whatever trade-off you lose, the space you lose for the room in your
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:45.840]   house, uh, the experience I I've, I've just found we've only had two au pairs
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.960]   so far, but, uh, to be totally worth it.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.480]   And we're, we're already on track, uh, for, for another one next.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:56.040]   So two experiences will lead to a third and we'll see what happens next.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.640]   My guess is you wouldn't, you can't imagine your life not having it.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.160]   And that's what I've heard from others.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:07.520]   I mean, I think that when kids are in school all the time and, you know, maybe
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.280]   they're going to camp in the summer or something like that, I could see a world
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.960]   where it's less beneficial to have full-time childcare when, you know,
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.120]   there's kids are out more, but right now when they're kids, you know, they're
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:24.000]   not out more, like, I, I feel like it would be impossible for me and Amy to
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.200]   both work and not have childcare.
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:33.160]   And, you know, the au pair experience for us is much more exciting than,
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:37.560]   you know, a nanny or daycare, but you know, they're like, I don't knock
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.440]   anyone for making any of those choices.
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:40.520]   It's just something that we love.
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:41.240]   Sure.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:47.880]   Children, notwithstanding point redemption, regardless, if you could
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:51.960]   today's Tuesday, if I could say to you, Hey, look, there's no work on Friday.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:56.160]   You and your wife can hop on, just go to San Francisco airport, take any
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:01.880]   flight anywhere in the world Thursday evening for a long, long weekend.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:07.400]   Where would you like to go to just the two of us or just the two of us?
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.400]   Let's assume for the moment that it's just the two of you.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:15.000]   Am I also assuming that for some reason, there's a, a flight, a
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.720]   nonstop flight anywhere in the world?
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.880]   That's a fantastic advanced level question.
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.880]   Let's assume no, we're going to play it on hard level.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.600]   Not like, not like magical level.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:28.760]   Let's, let's be realistic.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.240]   That's a great question.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:33.600]   The reason I ask is I've always wanted to go to the Canary islands and they seem
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:40.200]   quite difficult to get to, uh, from the West coast, um, I think, and how long are
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.240]   we going for you're going for the long weekend, so you fly out on Thursday
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:49.440]   night and you'll be back either Sunday or Monday, I'm gonna have to think about this.
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.600]   Well, I have my answer.
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.200]   Cause I prepared, can I tell you my answer?
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:59.680]   Uh, so I've been dying to go to Buenos Aires and here's why there's a direct
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:04.920]   flight from many places, probably from San Francisco, from Houston, from New York.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.720]   It's in the same time zone.
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:11.680]   And so you can take the flight at like 10 PM and you land, it's like a 10 hour
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:14.440]   flight and you land at 10 AM local time.
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.880]   You've not missed any time.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.960]   There's no jet lag per se.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:23.480]   To me, it seems like the most perfect, like whole new world environment
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:29.160]   and it's currency arbitrage because right now with not only the strong
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:32.680]   dollar, but just the Matt rampant inflation there and all the other stuff.
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:37.760]   It now does open up some interesting times for the dollar
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.680]   traveler to get exceptional value.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:42.520]   Yeah, we did a trip to Buenos Aires.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.040]   I don't know if this is still the case.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:47.160]   I should be prepared, but I didn't know this was coming, but at the
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.880]   time there were two exchange rates.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:53.360]   So there's, there's the, I think it was like the dollar blue, which is like
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.640]   the, the, the off market exchange rate.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.840]   And then the one you get, so you never, at least at the time, please fact check
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.720]   all of this at the time, you never want to pay with a credit card because
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.920]   they're going at the bank rate, but the other rate was like half the price.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.160]   So you would basically like walk down the street and someone be like, you
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.000]   need currency, you need exchange.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.160]   And you'd walk into some random place.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.920]   I remember at the time I was like watching YouTube videos on like how
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:18.480]   to test the currency, if it's real, because everyone's buying all their
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:19.920]   currency and like back alleys.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:21.880]   And now there's WhatsApp groups and you'd message them and
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:23.000]   they'd come to your hotel.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.040]   And, um, but I can only imagine that if inflation has gone rampant,
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:27.920]   the dollar has gone more valuable.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.520]   It's even more valuable to do this.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.120]   I second that.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.000]   The only thing I'd say is we went to Argentina.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:33.960]   Buenos Aires is awesome.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:34.800]   It's incredible.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.280]   It's one of the few places in the world.
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.840]   Maybe new Orleans is similar where people will say, Oh, you've
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.360]   got to check out the cemeteries.
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:44.840]   Um, which is a strange thing to recommend, but they're just so
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.840]   interesting and different than you've seen anywhere and beautiful and ornate.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:54.440]   Um, but there's just so much cool stuff in Argentina that I wish that you would
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:58.040]   have more time than a weekend to go there, but I did do an episode for you
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:02.880]   to listen to with the basketball player, Manu Ginobili, who's from Argentina,
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.680]   where he talked about some of his favorite tips.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.120]   So check that out before you go.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:13.080]   Um, I also did a similar trip for a long weekend to Bogota, which was awesome.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.040]   Even closer, same time zone.
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.080]   Um, really accessible.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.600]   Gosh, I don't know where I would go for a long weekend.
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.720]   So let me throw some ideas out of there.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:23.320]   Is that okay?
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:24.160]   Yeah, go for it.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.640]   Would you guys go to Hawaii?
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.840]   We are going to Hawaii in a few months.
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:32.080]   So I feel like I would not go there this weekend if it was a surprise adventure.
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:32.720]   Okay.
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.720]   Would you go to Japan?
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:36.800]   A hundred percent, but Japan is not open right now.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:37.680]   Oh, you're right.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:38.320]   You're right.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:38.680]   You're right.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:39.040]   Okay.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.120]   So Japan would always be the number one on the list.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:44.360]   It's like, if you want to go on a trip, we're always like, is Japan possible?
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.880]   If not, we'll look at the rest of the world.
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:46.640]   Yes.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:47.800]   Would you go to Bangkok?
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.480]   Would you do anything in Southeast Asia?
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.840]   So we're actually talking, this is so funny, all the things you mentioned.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:58.120]   So we're talking about taking a trip, maybe October, November for a couple
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.040]   weeks, um, with kids and au pair.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:04.040]   And the plan was to go to Japan, but because it's closed now we're talking
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:08.040]   about Bali or Vietnam or Thailand, because we had so much fun there.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.680]   The trip, if you hadn't constrained it to a weekend would
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:11.720]   be, let's go to New Zealand.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:15.680]   I've heard incredible things about New Zealand, nonstop flight, crazy
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:20.920]   long, uh, way more manageable without children than with, and that would be
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:24.600]   the place, but I just couldn't imagine going all the way there and then turning
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.640]   around three days later and coming back.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:32.040]   So that would have been my, my go-to had that not been the constraint.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.400]   I love the New Zealand.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:38.640]   Is there any place in South America or Central America that is interesting to you?
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.000]   You mentioned Bogota.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.520]   I went to Medellin and I have to admit, I didn't feel safe there.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:49.080]   Um, I felt, we heard a couple stories where there was one day, I just
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.560]   wanted to go take a nap in the park.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.360]   And someone's like, you're not going to, you're not going to take a nap in the park.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.240]   That's not a thing that we do here.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.280]   And the idea to like not have your cell phone out and things like that, it became
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:04.000]   enough where I was just kind of spooked eventually and we bounced, but I heard
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.840]   so many great things about Medellin.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.640]   I'm curious what your Bogota experience was, or if there's anywhere
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.160]   else in Central or South America.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:10.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.480]   I mean, if I were recommending to other people, uh, I could go on for
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:19.360]   like a, a great list of definitely Mexico city, awesome weekend trip from the U S.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.800]   Uh, you just want to sit on the beach and relax.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:26.040]   Cabo's a great trip, uh, from the U S Bogota was a great trip.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.120]   Oh, what's up with Oaxaca.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.120]   Have you been to Oaxaca?
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:30.640]   I have not, but I've heard cool things.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:34.080]   Um, I haven't been, so I think one place I'd go for the long weekend.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.040]   Uh, I'd go to Costa Rica.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:42.280]   I went once, uh, before my wife and I, uh, like, I think we'd even met and it
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:46.120]   was awesome and she's never been, she's wanted to go and now it's been 10 plus
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.280]   years, a lot of what we'd want to do.
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:51.800]   We looked at doing with kids and we were like, gosh, it's just not, not
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.800]   the right place to go right now.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.000]   Like I want to go surfing.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.160]   We want to go like hiking in the rainforest and like, they're just not
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.400]   the most toddler friendly activities.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:05.760]   So to finally answer your question, if we got thrown on a plane right now,
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:08.560]   uh, this weekend, I'd, I'd say let's go to Costa Rica.
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:12.360]   It's not the most inconvenient from the West coast, way easier from
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.080]   LA because there's direct flights.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.040]   Um, that's probably where we'd go.
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:22.000]   All the hacks listener beat up in Costa Rica, get ready cocktail party
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.560]   with the cocktail party, with the name tags.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:24.800]   Okay.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.440]   Speaking of travel, this is my last and final question for you.
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:32.680]   Do you have any travel gadgets that you absolutely love?
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:37.120]   It could be as simple as, for example, I have a travel spork, this tiny little
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.120]   spork that I just throw in my backpack.
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.880]   And maybe I only use it like once every four months, but when I get to use it,
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.920]   I'm like, hell yeah, I got that sport.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.640]   I don't have a, you know, some people have that long list of
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.360]   here's all my cool travel gear.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.400]   I don't have the long travel gear list.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.160]   The couple of things I'll share that I think are important.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:01.400]   And one, we use those like stuff sacks to compress your, uh, travel,
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.000]   all your clothes and everything else.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.480]   Those were a huge win.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.640]   When my wife and I traveled for eight months, we were backpacking.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.560]   So it was one carry on 30 liter backpack each.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:12.040]   So space efficiency was important.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:18.520]   The other one is I have this really small, like three outlets, uh, extension cord.
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:20.560]   It's not even, I wouldn't even call it extension cord, but I also
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.880]   wouldn't call it a surge protector because it doesn't actually
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.320]   have any surge protection.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:28.000]   But it's basically like, instead of bringing, we all have like, okay,
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.120]   I got my iPhone charger.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.440]   Maybe I've got my, you know, this charger, that charger, you
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:32.520]   got all these things to charge.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.760]   Instead of bringing four ways to plug them into an outlet in
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.960]   Europe or an outlet in Japan, I just bring like a little tiny
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.720]   portable travel power strip.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:43.160]   And one power converter.
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:47.000]   Cause usually if you're at a hotel, they'll have one, or you can buy one
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000]   at any street side thing for a dollar or two, and then I have the power
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.200]   strip so I can plug everything in.
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:55.240]   That's probably like the one unique thing.
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.760]   Uh, I bring everything else.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:58.920]   It's just kind of like, okay, you know, I bring my passport.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:02.320]   I bring a backpack, you know, I don't have a, a crazy laundry
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.520]   list of cool, cool gadgets anymore.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.520]   That's a great one.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:10.040]   Cause I often find that I need three plugs and there's only two, or it's
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.360]   really hard, exactly like you said with the, with the power adapter.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.600]   So I like the micro mini non-search search protector.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:18.160]   That's a good one.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:23.040]   On travel for you, there's two places you wrote about in your blog that I'd
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:26.040]   love you to, to kind of recommend or not.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.680]   And it's Kyrgyzstan and the, the Azores.
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.560]   Is it Azores?
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:30.040]   I don't know.
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:35.440]   I think locals pronounce it, which is just very, um, so Kyrgyzstan.
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.520]   I went to Kyrgyzstan.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:42.760]   I flew to Kyrgyzstan on business using United points from Istanbul.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:46.000]   And that's where I got to experience the lounge in Istanbul.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:46.800]   And it was amazing.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.000]   Kyrgyzstan was fantastic.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.760]   It did seem like the edge of the world.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:54.880]   It felt like no man's land.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.320]   Kyrgyzstan was good.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:00.000]   Uzbekistan, I'm going to give a hard pass to.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:07.080]   I found Uzbekistan to be very boring and very quiet.
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:11.880]   And maybe if you're a history nerd and you really geek out about the
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.560]   Silk Road and things like that.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:16.960]   But for me, Uzbekistan was a pass.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:22.600]   For the Azores, the Azores, the Azores, however you pronounce it.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.400]   I went there on a cruise.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.640]   I've done a bunch of cruises.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.920]   Have you guys done any cruises?
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:31.080]   One like weekend cruise to the Bahamas and that's it.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:36.040]   So let's, let's, let's jump to cruises that like, I'd love your, your take on cruises.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.160]   I'd love to talk about cruises.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.640]   Cause I do them in a really weird way.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:40.280]   I do weird cruises.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:44.840]   For example, I'm going on one tomorrow that goes Vancouver to Los Angeles.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:50.360]   I've done a lot of transatlantic cruises where they reposition the cruise.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.720]   That's when I went to the Azores or the Azores.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:59.800]   Um, I went the longest cruise I ever went on was from Vancouver to Tokyo.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:02.000]   I think it was 17 days.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.200]   Now these cruises, you're not partying hard.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.960]   This is not a party cruise.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.840]   That's going, it's a really unique type of person who goes on this cruise.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.680]   And I love it because I get to caught up on my reading.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.720]   I'll read a book a day.
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:18.640]   Sometimes I get my diet dialed in.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.480]   I get my gym routine.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:24.720]   You're you have the opportunity to reinvent your life at sea.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.640]   And it's a really special experience there.
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:32.240]   They're generally called repositioning cruises and they're very unique.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.800]   And those are the cruises that I like, but even regular cruises with friends.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.760]   Um, I love to do them and I think it's, it's unique cause I've
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:40.960]   been to a lot of weird places.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.720]   And I think people might think like, oh, you're too good for cruises.
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:49.080]   Um, but environmental concerns aside, I do think that they are a neat
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:54.240]   opportunity for you to imagine how your life could be when there's no constraints.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:54.720]   That's neat.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:55.200]   That's cool.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.840]   I think I got to give it another try.
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.640]   And I think cruises are, are, are more kid friendly than
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.760]   many other types of travel.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.920]   So they are so kid friendly.
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:03.680]   They're incredible.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.480]   People rave about Disney cruises.
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:09.560]   I want to try the new Virgin cruises that are really, really tailored to
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:12.920]   millennials and Gen X and things like that.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:14.120]   All right.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.000]   I got a couple of quick questions for you.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.560]   You run a friend's newsletter and I think I've seen you
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:20.760]   write that everyone should.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:21.600]   You talk about it.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.360]   I think everyone should have a friend's newsletter when you were growing up.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:30.440]   Did your family, did your parents send like an annual Christmas card or
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:32.440]   holiday card with family updates?
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:34.640]   Uh, my grandparents always did.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.520]   Your grandparents always did.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:36.880]   All right.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.400]   And what would be in that card?
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.320]   It was just, here's everything we, and all of our kids and
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.080]   grandkids families did this year.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:44.800]   Yes.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:45.280]   Yes.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.840]   My friend's newsletter came out of that tradition.
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:49.400]   My parents were in the military.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:53.960]   And so that idea of giving this annual status update before social
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:58.040]   media, where we do daily status updates, that annual status update
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:01.680]   was something I wanted to do on a quarterly basis for my friends.
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.600]   But I tried to add value.
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.120]   So it wasn't just about me.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.280]   I'd include a nice Netflix show.
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.280]   I'd seen a great movie or a book.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:12.360]   I'm making recommendations for my friends about cool stuff.
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.760]   And I started it just every quarter.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:19.000]   Sending to my friends, throwing them on BCC, adding a little note.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.760]   Hey, if you don't want to get this, just write me back.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:21.520]   We'll still be friends.
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.360]   I won't be offended.
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:25.360]   And it has been so powerful and helpful to me.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:28.520]   I'd encourage everybody to think about starting a friend's newsletter.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:32.000]   In many ways, the origin of the, all the hacks newsletter was
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.680]   that many, many years ago.
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:38.200]   Uh, how, how I started this newsletter called life updates.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.920]   And it was like once a year, a life update of what I was up to.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:45.040]   And then every time I started some new project, I kind of like somewhat
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:48.680]   folded them together and it kind of evolved and evolved and some
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:50.040]   people have been on it since then.
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:52.960]   Some people obviously just found out about it since relaunching the
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:55.000]   podcast or launching the podcast.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.960]   What things, when you were sending that newsletter, think
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.520]   back to the earliest days.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.080]   Think to the earliest days.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:07.480]   For example, I, I can't talk about this now, but I added
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:10.600]   people who didn't ask to be added.
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:13.120]   I just sort of spammed my friends a little bit.
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:18.440]   Um, and that helped me get started to be honest, but I'll tell you what, if I did
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:22.600]   a hundred friends and if three of them, if five of them were mad that I spammed
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:26.160]   them, the other 95 were not mad.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.000]   And some weren't even happy to receive my updates.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.480]   So because everyone likes to travel, I love to ask every one of my guests to
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:36.760]   pick a place anywhere in the world that they know well, and tell someone who's
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:39.960]   there, what they should do, what they should eat, where they should have a
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:41.600]   drink and kind of give them a few ideas.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:42.640]   All right.
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:43.960]   Because I spent 13 years there.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:47.160]   I'm going to say New York city, but I'm going to give some new ideas that maybe
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.520]   people may not have heard elsewhere.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:53.200]   Number one, the best park, the second best park in New York city, the first
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.520]   best, obviously being central park.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:59.000]   The second best park in New York city is Washington square park.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.640]   It is a locals only filled with characters.
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.720]   The vibes are immaculate.
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.040]   You can go almost any time for people watching and it's
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:09.600]   very centrally located there.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:15.200]   Uh, at the metropolitan museum of art, I mentioned that there's two entrances.
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:16.880]   There's two entrances at the Met.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:22.280]   You listeners can take the entrance at 81st street to skip the lines.
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:24.120]   Now, when else should you go to the Met?
[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:28.240]   Well, on Friday and Saturday nights, cause the Met stays open late till nine o'clock.
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.760]   Most people do not know this.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:33.320]   I would suggest arriving at seven and you can enjoy the
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:35.280]   museum almost all to yourself.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:39.560]   So I would suggest that, uh, before the Met, why don't you go to central park?
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:43.280]   And go to my favorite place in central park called sheep meadow.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:48.240]   Sheep meadow is a sprawling green area with skyscraper views.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:50.280]   It's a great place to have a picnic.
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:53.240]   Really the best place in central park, in my opinion.
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:56.920]   And then the last thing that I'll suggest is if you want a
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.640]   fun activity in New York city.
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:02.120]   I'm not sponsored, but there's a thing called Scott's pizza tour.
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:05.760]   Scott is a classic tour guide in New York city.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.120]   And he has a whole network of guides where they show you the behind the
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.440]   scenes of how the pizza is made and things like that.
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:12.320]   I love that place.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.480]   Scott's pizza tour.
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.680]   You've written about a ton of things on your blog.
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.600]   Everything from Chrome extensions.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.640]   You love using a virtual assistant, saving money, buying a car.
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.840]   I had this lofty dream of getting to all of these topics.
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:24.800]   We're not going to do that.
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.800]   Um, I definitely recommend people check out the book, check out the blog.
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:31.080]   Where else can people find you online?
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.520]   What do you want them to check out?
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:33.600]   Uh, before we wrap.
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.640]   Uh, so I wrote a book called the two hour cocktail party.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.160]   That is if you like this show, it's incredibly tactical and practical
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:42.080]   with a lot of specific instructions.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:45.280]   And the name of that book is called the two hour cocktail party.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:55.720]   If you go to my book website, www.party, P A R T Y.pro www.party.pro, you can get
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:59.840]   a free two page party checklist that includes an executive summary of my
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.720]   book with all that you need to know.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:02.840]   And you can download that there.
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.120]   It's like a PDF file.
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:07.160]   Um, and then I do have a friend's newsletter, which I think
[01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:09.200]   is like my favorite newsletter.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.840]   Nobody likes to read my friend's newsletter more than I do.
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:13.200]   And it's great.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.840]   Some people say it's one of their favorite newsletters after the, all
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.160]   the hacks newsletter, of course.
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:27.840]   Um, and you can find that on my website, which is www.nickgray.net and on social
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:32.480]   media, I'm @nickgraynews in the show notes will include how to host a clothing
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:36.840]   swap, how to host a happy hour, how to plan a networking event, other ideas that
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.520]   you can use to just bring people together.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:39.880]   Oh, here's the last thing I'll say.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:43.440]   All this stuff I've taught about is not rocket science.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:48.000]   Hosting a party is something anyone can learn, but no one really teaches
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.720]   us how to throw a well-run event.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:52.680]   This is something you can learn and you can become good at
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:54.040]   that just might change your life.
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:55.920]   I love it.
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.360]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.920]   Thanks for having me.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:16.280]   [Music]
