[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   Well, thank you.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.560]   It really is an honor for me to be with you.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.420]   I'm sorry for your sakes that Pastor John wasn't able to make it, but I am honored by
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.400]   the opportunity to open the Word of God to you in his place.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.780]   I said to Brad Armstrong on the way in, I said, "I'm here to disappoint everybody."
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.400]   You know, I'm trusting the Lord that he will minister grace to you through his Word, even
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.000]   if the steward is different than expected.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.320]   I have, as I hope was evident in the Q&A, I have great respect for what you do, Christians
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.360]   working in the STEM fields, in environments which are often extremely hostile to God,
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.040]   hostile to Christ, hostile to Scripture, and hostile to the very truth that you and they
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.160]   must presuppose if you were to do your jobs well.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.460]   The sciences, properly executed, I said something about this in the last hour, they discover
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.840]   and articulate truths that God has revealed in His creation, the creation over which Christ
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.020]   presently reigns as Supreme Lord and King, the truths that are amplified and further
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.260]   revealed and clarified in the 66 infallible and inerrant books of the Old and New Testaments.
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:38.180]   The very success of the people in your fields depends upon these foundational facts that
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.860]   so many in your fields reject out of hand, inconsistently, of course, but reject nonetheless.
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.260]   It's something like a mechanic who is vehemently morally opposed to the existence of nuts and
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.540]   bolts and screws, right?
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.140]   It'd be really tough to work in that guy's garage.
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.940]   Don't talk to me about nuts and bolts and screws.
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.660]   Don't talk to me about a Creator and a King and truth.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.460]   That's akin to what many of you have to do since these fields have been hijacked by the
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:18.660]   enemies of truth and who so often persecute those who don't receive their a priori secularism.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.580]   There's a sense in which you are all like special agents of the true King working behind
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.640]   enemy lines, but in territory that really belongs to the King.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.020]   And in those environments, you're bombarded with unbiblical ideas and worldly agendas
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.880]   each and every day.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.740]   And so Mathema exists to help you think biblically about these issues and to assess and evaluate
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.500]   them according to a biblical worldview and to encourage and strengthen you to be faithful
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.980]   witnesses to the truth in hostile territory.
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.620]   It's a delicate balance to be sure.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.580]   On the one hand, your employer has not hired you to be a Christian missionary to your organization,
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.580]   right?
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:11.140]   And you're there to do a job and you're there to honor Jesus by doing that job with excellence.
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:19.220]   And on the other hand, Jesus has sent you to that workplace to be a witness to the truth
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.180]   and your commitment to Him supersedes everything in your life.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.940]   So truly, I don't envy the position that you're in.
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.700]   I'm glad that I work where I work.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.920]   God has gifted me to do this, and I'm glad that I get to do it.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.540]   But God has gifted you to do the things you're doing.
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.220]   I still don't envy you.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.240]   The challenges and the temptations are obvious, right?
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.320]   How much will I be willing to compromise in order to keep the peace?
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.100]   What truths won't I speak about for the sake of keeping my job?
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.940]   And we can get very pragmatic.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.020]   I mean, I need to provide for my family.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.340]   I've spent all these years in education, you know, sometimes I've got student loans to
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.460]   pay back.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.020]   Even if I've paid them all back, I need to provide for my family.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.660]   If I'm not here, if it's not me, they'll hire somebody else who doesn't have a biblical
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.460]   worldview at all, who's not concerned at all to be a witness to the truth.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.100]   So I don't envy you.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.240]   But in the time that I have with you, I do want to encourage you not to compromise.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.420]   I do want to stir you up to be bold in your stand for the truth behind enemy lines.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.420]   If you are going to be, as the TMU mission statement says, empowered for a life of enduring
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:45.700]   commitment to Christ in the midst of our society, you are going to need to be equipped to suffer
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.820]   for Christ's sake in a manner that is worthy of the gospel.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.620]   If you're going to persevere in a life of sacrificial, life-laid-down ministry to a
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.900]   world that is actively hostile to you and to your Savior, you need to be equipped with
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.140]   a sound theology of Christian suffering.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:14.280]   And in the text that I've chosen for this final session, Philippians 1:29-30, the apostle
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.940]   Paul is aiming to lay just such a foundation for the Philippians, to equip them to suffer
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.020]   in a manner worthy of the gospel.
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.680]   Now the Philippians had been transformed by the gospel.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.800]   They were no longer slaves of Caesar.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.020]   They were now faithful slaves of Jesus.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.080]   Their identity was no longer in being devoted citizens of the Roman Empire.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.920]   They were now citizens of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.520]   They had been called out of darkness into Christ's marvelous light, 1 Peter 2.9.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.760]   And so, they began to face hostility from the darkness around them.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.960]   We read in Philippians 1.28 of their opponents.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.640]   Verse 29 speaks of suffering for Christ's sake, and verse 30 speaks about the conflict
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.260]   they're experiencing.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:14.400]   And it's in this context of opposition and suffering and conflict that the apostle Paul
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.660]   calls them in chapter 1 verse 27 to conduct yourselves as citizens in a manner worthy
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.780]   of the gospel of Christ.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.980]   They are to live lives that are driven by that gospel.
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:38.800]   And specifically, he says, that means they are, verse 27, to stand firm in one spirit.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.840]   They are to strive together for the faith of the gospel.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.540]   And they are to be, verse 28, in no way alarmed by your opponents.
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.720]   They were to hold their ground amidst attacks to compromise.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.860]   They were to continue their mission of propagating the gospel behind enemy lines.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:08.320]   And they were to do it all without so much as flinching, because the king of heaven remains
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.160]   on his throne.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:18.000]   And he is infinitely more powerful than any opposing force could ever dream to be.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.860]   And then, in verses 29 and 30, Paul throws more fuel on the fire of the Christian's fearlessness
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.060]   in the face of the opposition to the gospel.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:37.740]   He says, "For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in Him,
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:46.220]   but also to suffer for His sake, experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me and
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.180]   now hear to be in me."
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:55.860]   What we have in this text are four truths about Christian suffering that increase the
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:03.020]   believer's resolve to endure hardship as soldiers of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.380]   Because for both the Philippians and for us, part of what it means for us to live in a
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:12.600]   manner worthy of the gospel, verse 27, is to suffer in a manner worthy of the gospel,
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.600]   verse 29.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:20.140]   And my prayer for you is that properly apprehending these four truths about Christian suffering
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.200]   will put a holy fire in your eyes.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:30.100]   So that when the hostility of the world comes, you will be undeterred, there'll be steel
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:37.300]   in your spine, you'll be fearless in the face of suffering, and thereby be equipped to live
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.820]   and to suffer in a manner worthy of the gospel.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:48.620]   And that first truth is, number one, suffering is a mark of Christian identity.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.660]   Suffering is a mark of Christian identity.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.340]   And the key to understanding this is to see the close connection between believing in
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.940]   Christ and suffering for Christ's sake in verse 29.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.820]   If you have your Bibles, look at the text.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:10.580]   "For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in Him, but also
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.180]   to suffer for His sake."
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:18.980]   And so, brothers and sisters, though many who name the name of Christ would want to
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:27.820]   deny this, we must make no mistake, suffering for Christ is a mark of Christian identity.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.500]   That teaching is established all throughout the New Testament.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.340]   Jesus Himself said it in John 15, 19, "If you were of the world, the world would love
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.340]   its own.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.140]   But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world because of this,
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.400]   the world hates you.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.500]   Remember the word that I said to you, a slave is not greater than his master.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:53.860]   If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you."
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:59.640]   Peter wrote to suffering Christians in 1 Peter 4, 12, "Beloved, do not be surprised at the
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.520]   fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.140]   were happening to you."
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.020]   Hear how he's reasoning?
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.020]   Don't be surprised.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.780]   Persecution is not strange.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.740]   This is normal for the follower of Jesus.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.140]   If they persecute Him, they'll persecute His followers.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:24.280]   Romans 8, 16, and 17, Paul writes, "The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:31.060]   are children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ,
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:39.340]   if indeed we suffer with Him, so that we may also be glorified with Him."
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:43.940]   We are heirs if we suffer with Him.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:49.020]   And it's stated nowhere more clearly than in 2 Timothy 3, 12, where Paul states plainly
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:57.620]   and emphatically, "All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.540]   There's no wiggle room there.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.340]   It's not all Christians in closed countries will be persecuted.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.140]   It's not all pastors and missionaries will be persecuted.
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.820]   It's not all super-evangelistic, super-spiritual, super-Christians will be persecuted.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:19.500]   No, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.820]   Why?
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:29.100]   Well, because the darkness hates the light, because the kind of life that is commanded
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.540]   of those who would conduct themselves in a manner worthy of the gospel sticks in the
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.100]   craw of the enemies of righteousness.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:45.460]   And that kind of life lived on the path of light indicts the sinful lifestyle of those
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:53.420]   on the path of darkness by exposing it, by exposing it in the light of holy living.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.540]   I don't like that guy.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.540]   Why?
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.540]   He's a goody two-shoes.
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.060]   I don't like that woman.
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.060]   Why?
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.540]   Because she's so perfect.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:07.580]   That's not necessarily so, but when you aim to conduct yourselves according to a standard
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.540]   of righteousness, not in order to earn your salvation, but because you've been saved,
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:19.060]   the people who recognize that's not my life, they're indicted by it, they're convicted
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.060]   by it.
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:26.540]   And because people suppress the truth in unrighteousness, they do what they can to stuff that down.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.080]   So the darkness hates the light.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.900]   So you ask, so how, for Paul and the Philippians, how in the world is telling them that suffering
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:43.740]   is certain supposed to comfort and strengthen the Philippians to face that persecution?
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:48.300]   Well, it's comforting because Paul is telling them that suffering for Christ in the way
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:54.660]   that they have been suffering and the way that they will continue to suffer is an identifying
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.100]   mark of one who truly belongs to Christ.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.860]   It has been granted to you not only to believe, but also to suffer for Christ's sake.
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:10.060]   Suffering for Christ marks you out as a true believer.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.180]   John Calvin put it beautifully in his commentary on this passage.
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:20.060]   He says, "Persecutions are, in a manner, seals of adoption to the children of God,
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.260]   if they endure them with fortitude and patience.
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:28.060]   Their adoption can no more be separated from sufferings than Christ can be torn asunder
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.180]   from himself."
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:37.340]   So suffering for Christ's sake is the seal of our adoption into His family.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.400]   It's our birthright.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.740]   It's our badge of authenticity.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:47.540]   Peter says again in 1 Peter 4, "Don't be surprised, but," verse 13, "to the degree that you share
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:54.060]   the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.640]   you may rejoice with exaltation.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:04.500]   If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the spirit of glory
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.700]   and of God rests on you."
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.780]   And so this hostility that you experience at the hands of the adversaries of the gospel
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:27.540]   is, Philippians 1:28 says, "Assign an evident token from God of your salvation, for because
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.140]   to you it's been granted, not only to believe but to suffer, because the God who has given
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:39.700]   you His salvation has, with that gift, also graced you to be Christ's people in the world,"
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:48.140]   which means you will suffer for His sake just as He did for your sake.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:53.080]   The question that you've got to ask yourself is, "If suffering for Christ is a mark of
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:59.140]   Christian identity, am I suffering for His sake?"
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.400]   And I don't just mean martyrdom and imprisonment and physical abuse.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:10.940]   I mean the kind of social ostracism and opposition that comes from faithfully and obediently
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:17.400]   following Christ in a world that hates Him and everything He stands for.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:23.380]   Do you know what it is to be shunned as a hateful bigot simply for refusing to compromise
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:28.580]   on the Bible's condemnation of homosexuality and transgenderism?
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:35.340]   Men, do you know what it is to be mocked as a prude because you won't join the men at
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:41.580]   work in making sexual comments and evaluations of this woman or the other?
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:49.060]   Ladies, do you know that look of alienation and bewilderment from the other wives and
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:55.460]   mothers or ladies at the workplace who don't complain about their children or gossip about
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.860]   their husbands or boyfriends?
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:06.060]   Do you know what it is to be looked upon by the sophisticated minds of society as a knuckle-dragging
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:11.260]   fundamentalist because you won't compromise the scriptural teaching about men's and women's
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.140]   roles in marriage and in the church?
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.540]   Or because you won't compromise the scriptural teaching about God's creation of the universe
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.620]   in six literal 24-hour days?
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.820]   Can you pour out your heart to someone in proclaiming the gospel to them, lovingly and
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:33.620]   sincerely entreating them to be saved from the wrath to come and to run to everlasting
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:41.540]   joy and salvation in Christ, only to have them mock you as a narrow-minded xenophobe
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:47.340]   who just wants to control everybody and make people believe the same as you?
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:52.740]   Do you know the feeling of being aliens and strangers in the world?
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:58.820]   Do you know the pain of knowing that you're far from home?
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:05.060]   Foxes have holes, birds have nests, the Son of Man has nowhere on this earth that He spoke
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:11.740]   into existence and sustains with His Word to lay His head.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:19.740]   The key is if so, if you know those pains of alienation, of being strangers, don't be
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.060]   discouraged.
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:29.620]   Those are marks of the citizens of heaven, those who are out of place as citizens of
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.480]   the kingdoms of this world.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:42.480]   On the other hand, what if you don't know that pain, that ostracism?
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.160]   Can you fit right in?
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:50.120]   I mean, you go to church on Sundays, maybe Bible study once a week or every other week,
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:58.400]   but for the rest of your time in the world, is it that you seem right at home?
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.520]   Have you so domesticated your faith?
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:06.200]   Have you so compartmentalized your relationship with Jesus Christ that no one can tell the
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:12.500]   difference between you, a professed follower of the Lord Jesus and a pagan who loves and
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.320]   serves himself?
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.000]   No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.820]   Do you stick out as a light among the darkness or can you get along just fine in the world
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:33.920]   because you've been unwilling to stand publicly for what would bring inconvenience for Christ's
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.600]   sake?
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:42.960]   We need to hear this, friends, because the kind of convenient, polite, socially inoffensive
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:49.520]   spectator kind of Christianity that provokes no hostility from the enemies of the gospel,
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.960]   Paul says, that kind of Christianity is a sham.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.580]   He says that kind of Christianity won't take you to heaven because to you it has been granted
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:08.080]   not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:13.800]   Suffering is a mark of Christian identity and so rather than running from it, when it
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.840]   comes we ought to be encouraged by it.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.020]   Christ said this would happen and it's happening.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.920]   I'm happy actually to bear that reproach.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.960]   I'm real.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.360]   I'm not just playing a role, I'm not just playing pretend.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:36.040]   I'm a believer and I know I'm a believer in part because I'm willing to suffer loss for
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.160]   his sake.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:44.960]   The strings of my heart are not so attached to what they can take from me.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.480]   They're attached to him.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.360]   I'll say more about that in a moment.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:57.940]   Secondly then, suffering for Christ's sake is a gift of divine grace.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.240]   It's a gift of divine grace.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:07.280]   Look with me again at verse 29, "For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake not
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.900]   only to believe in him but also to suffer."
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.900]   So we've established suffering inevitably comes to the true believer in Christ but where
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.680]   does it come from?
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.840]   Does it originate merely in the hostility of the opponents themselves?
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.720]   Does it come from a random chaotic uncontrolled universe so we've just drawn the short straw
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.820]   and need to make the best of things?
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:37.120]   Does it come from a random impersonal governing force like fate so we just have to grin and
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.600]   bear it?
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:46.520]   Does suffering ultimately come from Satan or demons?
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.240]   Ultimately we have to answer no to all of those questions.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.400]   Ultimately suffering comes from God.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.040]   Why do I say that?
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:05.440]   Well one, Scripture calls God the one who works all things after the counsel of his
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.480]   own will, Ephesians 1:11.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.920]   And we know, Romans 8:28, that God causes all things to work together for good to those
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.840]   who love God and are called according to his purpose.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.800]   All things, not just the good things.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:27.880]   And not God turns all the bad things into good things for those who love him.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.200]   That's not what the text says.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.300]   God does not just make the best out of a bad hand he was dealt.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:43.860]   He ordains all things for his purpose to glorify himself, to magnify his name.
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:48.860]   Joseph said as much in Genesis chapter 50 in verse 20, "You meant it for evil, the brothers
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:55.140]   who sold me into slavery, but God meant it for good."
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.900]   Not just turned it out for good.
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.900]   God's good on his feet.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.900]   He can make the best of a bad situation.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:08.660]   No, God meant the sinful action of Joseph's brothers for the good of preserving life.
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.580]   Genesis 45, 5 to 8.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.120]   Job says the same thing.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:19.140]   Chapter 1 verse 21, "The Lord has given and the Lord has taken away."
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:29.300]   Job 2.10, "Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity from him as well?"
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.340]   Even as Jeremiah the prophet stands in the rubble of the ravaged city of Jerusalem at
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:40.840]   the time of the Babylonian invasion, he asks, Lamentations 3.37, "Who is there who speaks
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.880]   and it comes to pass unless the Lord has commanded it?
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:54.900]   Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both good and ill go forth?"
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.420]   But even if I didn't have all those verses to turn to, you know how else I know that
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.020]   suffering for Christ's sake ultimately comes from God?
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:08.220]   Because Philippians 1.29 says, "It's been granted to us not only to believe but to suffer."
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.420]   Well, who has granted that we believe?
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:18.220]   Certainly not our opponents of the gospel and certainly not Satan.
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.900]   It's God who has granted us faith, Ephesians 2.8 and 9.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:32.260]   Faith is the gift of God and in the same way it is God who grants us to suffer.
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.980]   And consider the word itself, He grants us to suffer.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.620]   The word is charizomai from charis which is the New Testament word for grace.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.460]   It means to give as a gift or to give freely.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:49.260]   It's the same word in Romans 8.32 where Paul says, "He who did not spare his own son but
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:57.660]   delivered him over for us all, how will he not also with him freely give us all things?"
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:02.260]   Dear friends, what Paul is teaching us here is that the suffering that comes upon the
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:09.700]   people of God as a result of their faithful obedience to Christ in a hostile world is
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:16.440]   nothing less than a free gift of sovereign grace.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.940]   And I ask you, does God give poor gifts?
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.740]   Does He give gifts that are without purpose and without wisdom?
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:30.300]   Does He ever give gifts that are not beneficial and for the greatest good of those whom He
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.140]   gives them to?
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.060]   Of course not.
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:40.620]   All of God's good gifts to His children are good for His children.
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:46.600]   This text tells us that He gives us suffering for Christ's sake as a gift of His loving
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.880]   unmerited favor.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.180]   Now some of you are thinking, "What kind of favor is that, suffering?"
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.820]   If you're thinking that, I want you to know the apostles would have had no idea where
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:00.820]   you were coming from.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.580]   They just wouldn't get it.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.920]   And if you have your Bibles, turn over to Acts chapter 5.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.980]   The Sanhedrin had already thrown the apostles into prison for violating their command not
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.380]   to preach any longer in the name of Jesus.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.700]   But the angel of the Lord came in the middle of the night and freed them, and the next
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.020]   morning they were back in the temple preaching again, and so the Jews called them before
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:27.740]   the council again, and after some discussion about what would be done to them, verse 40,
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:34.300]   they flogged them and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and then released
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.300]   them.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:42.180]   So, Acts chapter 5 and verse 41, "They went on their way from the presence of the council,
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:49.700]   rejoicing that they had been considered worthy to suffer shame for His name."
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:57.780]   Our generation of professing Christians seeks to run from shame as far and as fast as possible,
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.820]   as if it were a pure, unmixed evil.
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:05.740]   If you're ashamed of the way that you feel inside, go ahead and mutilate your bodies
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:11.040]   so that you can match the body to the feelings and not feel that shame.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:16.620]   If you're ashamed of what your inclinations are, let's have a whole month dedicated to
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:22.780]   celebrating those inclinations so that nobody feels any shame.
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:28.540]   But the apostles' generation rejoiced that they had been considered worthy to receive
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:37.020]   the divine favor of suffering shame for the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:43.620]   And I would ask that God would grant that we see the glory that they saw.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:49.660]   That we would be so satisfied by Christ that we would count it a privilege to meet the
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:27:01.780]   world's shame, if it means that by that means we can put His glory on display.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:07.080]   Years after being flogged that day, Peter would write again in 1 Peter 4, "To the degree
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:12.240]   that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing."
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:17.860]   And again, if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but to glorify God
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.500]   in that name.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.660]   To glorify God in that name.
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:28.220]   You see, suffering for Christ's sake provides us with a wonderful opportunity to put the
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:33.380]   worth and sufficiency of Jesus on display to the world.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:41.980]   It gives us an opportunity to magnify Him by being more satisfied in Him than by all
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.740]   that life can offer us and all that death can take.
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.220]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:53.660]   Suffering for Christ's sake gives us an opportunity to magnify Him by being more satisfied in
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:28:00.100]   Him by showing the world that He is more satisfying than all that life could offer and all that
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.700]   death can take.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:09.100]   It's like the hymn says, "When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.180]   and stay."
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.700]   And so one pastor writes, "If we hold fast to Him when all around our soul gives way,
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:24.180]   then we show that He is more to be desired than all that we have lost."
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:29.780]   And friends, magnifying Christ, showing that He is more to be desired than all that we
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.620]   could lose, that's what we were created to do.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:39.020]   I don't care what your job is, you were created to show the world that there is no greater
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:44.140]   joy than making much of Jesus Christ.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:49.580]   There is no greater joy than knowing Him and the fellowship of His sufferings and making
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:54.780]   Him known through our sufferings for His sake.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.820]   It's a gift to suffer on behalf of Christ.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:04.780]   It's a gracious gift of unmerited favor to be given the privilege of being prisms to
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:11.480]   reflect the glory and the sufficiency of Jesus to the world.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:16.420]   But I'll take your treasure, oh, I've got a treasure you know nothing about.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:22.780]   I'll take your family, my heavenly Father provides for all my needs and my elder brother
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.380]   sits on the throne of heaven.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:30.860]   I'll take your children, maybe, but God would grant, if He is gracious, an opportunity for
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:36.820]   me to make spiritual children out of those that I might minister the gospel to.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.100]   I'll take your very life, you can't do that.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.340]   My life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.940]   I'm seated in the heavenly places already.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:52.260]   You see, when nothing, when everything that the world values doesn't hold a candle to
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:58.500]   you and to your affections, but you say, "He is more to be desired than all those things,"
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.980]   we make Christ look great.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:08.540]   That's why suffering is a gift, because what do you want in this life more than to make
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.140]   Christ look great?
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:22.500]   You, a sinner from the dung heap, from the mud pile, from the miry clay, you treasonous
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:32.380]   rebel, traitor to the King, whom He has graciously plucked out of the fire, you say, "I, me?
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.100]   I can make much of Jesus?
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:38.820]   My horrid little life could make much of Jesus?"
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:49.180]   Yeah, by the grace of God, it can, if indeed to you, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.100]   And so, when suffering and persecution come from those who would oppose Christ and His
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:58.180]   gospel, and when things get hard, and when it starts to hurt, and it threatens those
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:04.940]   things and those people whom you most treasure, don't try to save God from His sovereignty
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:10.780]   by thinking that those trials originate from someone other than your heavenly Father.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:16.540]   Don't cut the legs out from under the theology of sovereign grace upon which you stand.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:23.660]   You would destroy the very comfort that you seek if you did that.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:29.180]   Another great hymn says, "Heavenly peace, divinest comfort, hereby faith in Him to dwell,
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:35.780]   for I know whatever befall me, Jesus doeth all things well."
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.560]   Where do heavenly peace and divine comfort come from?
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:46.400]   From the knowledge that whatever happens, Jesus, the sovereign Lord, is doing all things
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.520]   well.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.960]   So don't try to save God from His sovereignty and in the same breath steal your heavenly
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.120]   peace and divinest comfort.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:03.420]   Instead, count that suffering as a gracious gift from the loving hand of your Father.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:08.520]   Then you would suffer in a manner worthy of the gospel.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.160]   Suffering for Christ's sake is a mark of Christian identity, and it's a gift of divine
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.160]   grace.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.840]   The third truth about Christian suffering is that Paul teaches us, or that Paul teaches
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.520]   us in this text, is that it is endured for Christ's sake.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:27.480]   It is endured for Christ's sake, and you can flip back to Philippians 1 and read verse
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.120]   29 with me again.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.800]   You've heard the repeated emphasis as I've said it over and over again, "For to you it
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:40.240]   has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in Him but also to suffer for His
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.360]   sake."
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.800]   Paul does not want to be misunderstood, he repeats it.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.840]   And so all the suffering we've been talking about this afternoon is the hostility believers
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:55.780]   face, particularly as a result of opposition to the gospel.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:00.600]   This is persecution in the proper sense, the more narrow sense.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.240]   One commentator puts it helpfully when he says, "The suffering in view here is not everyday
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.340]   headaches and heartaches.
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:10.920]   Suffering on behalf of Christ is caused by public identification with Christ in a world
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.360]   hostile to Christ."
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:19.600]   Now the Bible has glorious truths and promises about how we are to respond righteously to
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.180]   the everyday headaches and heartaches, for sure.
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:28.360]   And certainly the truths we've observed already can be carefully and legitimately applied
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.220]   to those circumstances.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:35.440]   But the suffering that is in view in this text and in much of the New Testament is suffering
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.440]   that is endured on behalf of Christ.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:43.080]   And you hear this emphasis everywhere, Matthew 5, 10 and 11, "Blessed are those who have
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:48.600]   been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:53.000]   Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and falsely say all kinds of
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.600]   evil against you because of me."
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.020]   Mark 10, 29, "Truly I say to you, there's no one who's left his house or brothers or
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:09.080]   sisters or mother or father or children or farms for my sake and for the gospel's sake,
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.340]   but that he will receive a hundred times."
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:18.360]   And one we've come back to a couple times, 1 Peter 4, 12 to 16, "Don't be surprised as
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.780]   if something strange were happening to you, but to the degree that you share the sufferings
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.140]   of Christ, keep on rejoicing.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:30.560]   If you're reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the spirit of glory
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.200]   and of God rests on you.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:38.000]   Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer or thief or evildoer or a troublesome meddler.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.200]   But if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   this name."
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:50.180]   And so when I say that we need to shine as lights in a dark world, I don't simply mean
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:56.420]   that we need to "live differently" in some sort of general sense.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:02.200]   You cannot legitimately claim these promises of comfort for suffering for the sake of a
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:08.040]   generic morality that holds doors and pulls out chairs and doesn't use foul language and
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.680]   is generally respectful of people.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:17.420]   On a horizontal level, even enemies of the truth can be polite and respectable people.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:24.700]   But Paul is calling us to the kind of suffering that happens on behalf of Christ.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:29.780]   And when I say that we need to eschew this kind of convenient Christianity that provokes
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:36.060]   no hostility, I don't mean that provoking hostility in and of itself is a virtue.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:41.680]   If you suffer hostility because you're belligerent and annoying, or if you stick out from the
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.820]   world just because you're a strange person, that's not Christian suffering.
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:51.340]   One preacher said, "This is not a Christian kookishness that counts it the highest virtue
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.740]   to go around disturbing people by being different."
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:36:01.220]   No, this is suffering particularly and specifically as a result of our attachment to and likeness
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:05.220]   and commitment to Christ.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.940]   And so our suffering is to be endured for Christ's sake.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:13.060]   And I would say that that gives us strength to endure the trials that are coming.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:20.180]   Because friends, I ask you, is there anything that you cannot endure for His sake?
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:25.540]   For the sake of the innocent Lamb of God who bore the unfettered wrath of His own dear
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:34.500]   Father on the cross so that impure, unholy, treasonous rebels like you and me could be
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:43.020]   purified and reconciled as friends and seated around the table of the King of all kings?
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.380]   To bear reproach for His sake?
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:54.140]   That's no trouble for me, not when He's borne so much reproach for my sake.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:37:02.540]   What are the frowns of a few fellow mortals if we can see His smile, if we can know Him,
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:08.860]   if we can walk more closely and more intimately with the Savior who is the apple of our eye,
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:15.260]   who is at the very bottom, the very bedrock foundation of our joy and comfort?
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:22.780]   Surely we can endure suffering for His sake.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:28.020]   And then number four, the fourth truth about Christian suffering that will prepare us to
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:34.660]   suffer in a manner worthy of the gospel is that suffering is a means of sweet fellowship.
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.080]   Suffering is a means of sweet fellowship.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.120]   Look with me at verse 30.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:46.460]   It's granted to you to suffer, experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me and
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:50.860]   now hear to be in me.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:56.100]   And what we see here in verse 30 is what one writer calls a masterful stroke of pastoral
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.420]   comfort on the part of the Apostle Paul.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.980]   The Philippians would remember, like it was yesterday, the beatings and the imprisonment
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.020]   that Paul suffered at the hands of the crowds in Philippi.
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.940]   It's recorded in Acts chapter 16.
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:15.640]   And now they're hearing of his resolute fearlessness in the midst of his sufferings, his resolve
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:22.940]   to magnify Christ whether by life or by death, verse 19 of chapter 1, or verse 19 and 20.
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:27.700]   And he's preaching the gospel unto the conversion of many even in the praetorian guard into
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:31.980]   Caesar's own household, Philippians 1, 12 to 18.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:37.300]   They hear of the sufferings and they think of all that Paul's endured for the sake of
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.740]   the gospel.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:44.980]   And you realize they came to regard him like we regard him, right, as a hero.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:52.360]   And Paul is saying, you're now experiencing that very same thing.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.460]   We are brothers in arms.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:59.740]   And the Philippians would have been thrilled to hear that because there is a sweet fellowship
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:05.420]   that exists between brothers and sisters who suffer together for the cause of Christ.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:11.140]   And knowing that Paul regarded them as having the same kind of fellowship with him would
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.540]   have strengthened their hands to stand firm.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:20.000]   It would have strengthened them to continue striving together to be courageous and undaunted,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.260]   no way alarmed by the opposition.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.260]   And I think it should be no different for us.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:34.900]   We should be enticed to a resolute fearlessness in the face of opposition by knowing that
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:40.220]   suffering on behalf of Christ is a means of sweet fellowship with all of our brothers
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:45.220]   and sisters throughout the ages, all the faithful soldiers of Jesus Christ who have gone before
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:51.340]   us, who have been despised and forsaken by the world, men like Justin Martyr, and Polycarp
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:57.260]   of Smyrna, and Ignatius of Antioch, and William Tyndale, and John Huss, and Martin Luther,
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:03.900]   and John Rogers, and Hugh Latimer, and Nicholas Ridley, and John Knox, all of these and thousands
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:10.540]   of others of whom the world was not worthy, who loved not their lives even unto death,
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:17.460]   they are our brothers in arms, our band of brothers.
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.540]   And more than that, suffering is not just a means of sweet fellowship with them, with
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:24.420]   other believers, but with the Apostle Paul himself.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:28.380]   This is a man who laid down his life to travel the known world, who endured all manner of
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:33.220]   hostility, who wrote half the New Testament, and who's a spiritual hero to every Christian
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.460]   who's ever lived.
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:44.620]   He can lay down our lives for the same gospel mission that he suffered for.
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:50.020]   And Matthew, I want to know, don't you want your life to count for something?
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.700]   Of course you do.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:55.900]   Don't you want to live so that you don't waste the years that you've been given?
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:56.940]   Of course you do.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:02.800]   Don't you want to invest yourselves and to spend and be spent for something that is truly
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:08.060]   worthwhile and meaningful, something that will outlast this earth, where moth and rust
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.820]   destroy and where thieves break in and steal?
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:15.780]   I mean, talk about being part of something that's bigger than yourself.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:22.140]   We can be engaged in the very same conflict that the Apostle Paul himself was engaged
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:27.940]   in, provided we are willing, as he was, to lay down our lives, to live in a manner worthy
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:33.060]   of the gospel in a way that cuts straight across the grain of the world that we live
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:35.860]   in.
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.300]   But it gets better even than that.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:43.200]   The suffering that you experience for Christ's sake is not only providing you with the opportunity
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:47.300]   for unique and intimate fellowship with other soldiers of Christ.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.180]   It also provides you with the opportunity for unique and intimate fellowship with Christ
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.180]   himself.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:59.620]   See, when we become willing to follow in the footsteps of Jesus, to preach his gospel,
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:05.740]   to walk in holiness as he walked, we will provoke the same hostility from sinners that
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:09.200]   he provoked.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.580]   And in counting so many times people say, you know, we were just nice and we were just
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:19.100]   loving, and if we were just gentle, you know, like Jesus was, the world would like us, and
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.100]   then they would listen to the gospel.
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.060]   It's like, guys, they killed Jesus.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:27.740]   He was the nicest, gentlest, most, you know, respectful man that ever lived.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.620]   He was sinless and perfect, and they still killed him, and you think you're going to
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:37.980]   win them over by your winning smile and cunning charm?
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.580]   They killed him.
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:46.420]   But you see, as we count Christ more satisfying than all that life can offer and all that
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:53.740]   death can take, we suffer for the same cause of righteousness as the Lord himself, the
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.580]   creator and king of the universe.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.420]   That's a fellowship that the world knows nothing about.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:04.420]   That's what Paul means, Philippians 3.10, to know the fellowship of his sufferings.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:05.980]   It means a camaraderie.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:10.720]   It means an intimacy that we can have with our Savior by sharing in the sufferings that
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.060]   he experienced.
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:19.980]   And that should be an enormous amount of fuel to lay down our safe and comfortable lives
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:24.260]   and to lose our lives for Christ's sake and the gospel's sake.
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:32.180]   It is worth enduring all manner of hostility if we get to know him more intimately because
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:37.700]   of that hostility, if we get to see more of him in ways that we wouldn't otherwise know
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.100]   if we kept ourselves in the safety of our Christian bubble.
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:49.140]   Nice, polite, respectable, but are you willing to lay down your life for Christ, not just
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:53.380]   to die for him, but to lay down your life living for him?
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:44:00.180]   Are you willing to go to him and bear his reproach?
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.940]   Turn with me to Hebrews 13, we'll end here.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.900]   Hebrews chapter 13, verse 11.
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:10.660]   All throughout the book of Hebrews, the writer draws parallels between the Old Testament
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.980]   sacrifices and the Lord Jesus Christ as the perfect sacrifice.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:20.420]   In chapter 13, verses 11 and 12, he makes the point that just as the sacrifices were
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:27.220]   burned outside the camp, signifying a place of uncleanness and shame that was cut off
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:35.700]   from the community of God's people, so also was Jesus sacrificed outside the camp of Israel
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.340]   in hostile territory.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.700]   And then in verses 13 and 14, he gives the implications for the church.
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:48.500]   So Hebrews 13, verse 11, "For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:55.100]   the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the camp.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:45:01.980]   Therefore, Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.900]   outside the gate."
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:14.220]   So let us go out to him, outside the camp, bearing his reproach.
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.540]   Why?
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:19.320]   For here, we do not have a lasting city.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.500]   We are seeking the city which is to come.
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:29.540]   So you see, we are to leave the securities and the comforts of the camp and we are to
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:34.340]   go out and bear his reproach.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:39.020]   The reproaches that have fallen on you have fallen on me.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:43.460]   But the magnificent sweetness of this verse is that we don't simply go out, but that we
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:46.160]   go out to him.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.980]   He is out there on that road of suffering.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:56.100]   Jesus is out there waiting for you on that path of suffering endured for the sake of
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.100]   the gospel.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:05.260]   And he is calling us to come and enjoy the sweetness of the fellowship of his sufferings.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:10.860]   I can't say anything that would make it so that I might lose my job.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.660]   I can't say that thing.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.180]   I can't have that conversation.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.740]   Why?
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:21.900]   Because then I'd be on a road that leads me to the unemployment line.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:22.900]   You know what?
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.380]   Jesus is on that road.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:32.820]   If endured, if suffered for his sake truly, and not as an evildoer or a troublesome meddler,
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:39.660]   he's on the road of suffering and he's already walked it.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:46.020]   The 19th century London pastor Charles Spurgeon, called the Prince of Preachers by so many,
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:52.980]   asked his congregation the question I ask you today, "Can you take the side of a despised
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.840]   Christ?
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:00.180]   Can you stand at his cross?
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.880]   Can you own him when the blood is dripping from his wounds, when everybody thrusts out
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.720]   his tongue at him and has ill words for the crucified one?
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:17.920]   Can you say, 'I love him still'?
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:24.880]   Can you say with the hymn writer, 'Go then, earthly fame and treasure, come disaster,
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.960]   scorn and pain?
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.720]   In thy service, pain is pleasure.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:36.080]   With thy favor, loss is gain."
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.760]   With thy favor, loss is gain.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.360]   To live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:46.800]   I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:51.200]   Lord, for whom I've suffered the loss of all things and count them but rubbish so that
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.680]   I may gain Christ.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.480]   May God grant that it would be true of all who sit here this afternoon.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.200]   May God grant that it would be true of us.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.320]   Let's pray.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:11.560]   Father, would it be true, may it be true by the power of the Holy Spirit that you would
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:18.440]   seal to the hearts of your people this word that gives boldness, that breaks chains of
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:24.160]   cowardice, that frees unto fearlessness?
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.600]   We wouldn't go looking for suffering.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:33.840]   We wouldn't go taunting the enemies of the gospel to cause us to suffer, not at all.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:41.360]   But Lord, where faithfulness in this increasingly hostile world requires that we go out to Christ
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:46.600]   and bear His reproach on the road of suffering, I pray that you would give grace for us to
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.960]   walk out on that road.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:56.200]   It may be that simply being faithful to you in the public square means that we don't have
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:02.880]   jobs, means that we have to find another way of supporting our family, means that we have
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:12.000]   exceptionally tough questions to answer, but it's worth it.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:20.600]   None of what we have now is worth losing your favor.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:25.520]   Nothing that they could offer us is as sweet as the fellowship of the sufferings of Christ.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.760]   Help us to see that.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:30.800]   Help us to believe it, not just in our minds but in our hearts.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:37.560]   May it be that you cause us to walk so nearly with you that these things are...of course,
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:43.040]   these things are...yeah, the sight of Christ that I see in my morning devotions is sufficient
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.440]   to satisfy my heart for eternity.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:50.000]   And so you couldn't get me to trade that for anything.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.200]   Change us into such people who, when presented with sin, whether sins of compromise or any
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:03.720]   other sin, say, "What could you offer me that approaches the value of the blood of Christ
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:10.280]   shed in my place to free me from these very sins that you tempt me to?"
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.280]   It's madness.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.280]   It's lunacy.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:20.520]   And I pray that as these dear people go to work and interact with the people that you
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:25.080]   have sovereignly placed in their lives, that you would open their mouths, loosen their
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:32.800]   tongues, free them to be the ministers and witnesses to the truth that you have purchased
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.400]   for them to be by Christ's precious blood.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.640]   Give them a holy joy.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:46.200]   Protect them from rancor and anger at unrighteousness.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:52.760]   Give them a boldness, but may it be a brokenhearted boldness that speaks the truth with tears
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:51:01.640]   in the eyes and calls with tears of joy to come and know the great Savior that has purchased
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.440]   our inheritance of a lasting city.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.840]   Here we have no lasting city.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.720]   We're seeking the city which is to come.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:14.920]   Father, do in hearts what preachers cannot do and change your people for the glory of
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.960]   Christ, we pray in his name, amen.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:17.960]   Amen.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:18.960]   Amen.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:18.960]   Amen.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.960]   Amen.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:19.960]   Amen.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:29.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
