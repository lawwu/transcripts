[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.240]   Well, how do we return to normal life after a life-altering loss?
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.640]   Today's question is from a Brooklyn woman named Andrea.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.720]   Dear Pastor John, she writes, "My husband went home to be with the Lord two months ago
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.400]   after a four-month battle with pancreatic cancer.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.400]   We were both divorcees who met in October of 2019.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.680]   God restored our lives and we married in October of 2020.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.880]   I'm very thankful to have been married to my late husband.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.920]   The Lord had restored our lives in relationship.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.560]   There was so much joy to live with someone who loves you so much.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.600]   My late husband had a son now 20 years old.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.480]   We expected to spend the rest of our lives as a family unit, but our blissful days together
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.100]   were short and our worlds came crashing down.
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.160]   We held on to the Word of God, expecting a miracle healing right to the end.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.080]   He was not healed and didn't recover.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.240]   In fact, he suffered a lot of pain in the end.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.320]   Many of our friends supported and prayed for us, but now after my husband's passing, I
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.260]   can't find any purpose in life.
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.640]   Is this normal to feel this way?
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.320]   Friends ask me how I am, if I'm returning to work.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.300]   I can only say I'm okay, but deep in my heart, I am not okay.
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.160]   How do I continue to live my life?
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.480]   My heart feels very heavy.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.840]   I tried to listen to sermons and read the Bible, but nothing seems to be getting into
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.840]   my heart.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.160]   Thank you and God bless.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:45.680]   Andrea asks, is it normal to feel this way, namely, not being able to find purpose in
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.920]   life after her husband passed away?
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:58.600]   There are so many factors that affect how we function after a major loss that it's hard
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.040]   to say what is normal because everybody's situation is so different.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.400]   Age differences, employment differences, health differences, family differences, wider relationship,
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.480]   church, location, gifting, maturity, faith, and on and on.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.640]   So many differences, but I think I can say with some degree of certainty that the more
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:38.800]   your life is embedded in or intertwined with what or whom you've lost, whether it's a spouse
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:47.480]   or job or health or home or child, then the more normal it is to feel disoriented and
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.480]   aimless.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.480]   So that's true.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.960]   I think the answer will be closer to yes, it's normal, than no, it's not normal.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.000]   But Andrea's real question, it seems to me, is not so much am I normal, but what do I
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.280]   do?
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.040]   How do I continue to live my life, she says.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.160]   So here are some thoughts from scripture, because God is the one we have to turn to
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.120]   ultimately, isn't it?
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.600]   Number one, the first thing I would say is wait for the Lord.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:31.040]   Don't assume that the way you feel today is the way it will always be.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.520]   In time, the Lord will change things.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.680]   He will.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.440]   Which means that this is a God-appointed season of waiting.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.000]   I've learned this over years and years from watching my own heart and counseling lots
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   of people.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.500]   I've learned that Americans, or maybe you could say modern people in general, want quick
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.080]   solutions to our problems.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.800]   We don't like waiting.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.760]   But God is seldom in a hurry.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.760]   It's amazing.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.560]   God is simply seldom in a hurry.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.880]   It's almost as if he prefers the slow pace of healing and strengthening.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.600]   Early in my ministry, in fact, six weeks after starting my pastorate in the summer of 1980,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.320]   I preached a sermon about waiting from Psalm 40.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.320]   It's Desiring God.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.680]   I checked it out yesterday.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.200]   It's called In the Pits with a King.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.440]   Because David in Psalm 40 says, "I waited patiently for the Lord."
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.680]   And that's the key sentence.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.840]   He doesn't say how long he waited.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.840]   And I'm glad he didn't say it was a week or a month or a year.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.960]   I waited patiently for the Lord.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.880]   He inclined to me and heard my cry.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.560]   Yes, eventually he did.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:12.360]   He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog, and set my feet on a
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.200]   rock and made my steps secure.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.440]   He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.800]   Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.880]   Those are the first verses of Psalm 40.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.480]   So David is looking back on a season of misery.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.840]   He called it pit, miry bog.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:47.240]   And in this situation, his strategy was, "I waited and I cried to the Lord."
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.720]   And I'm glad he didn't say how long, a week, a month, a year.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:01.360]   That's the calling on all Christians in various degrees, in various times in this life.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.800]   Nobody escapes it.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.760]   We all will find ourselves in seasons where we have no choice but to wait for the Lord,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.560]   unless we're going to just rebel and throw in the towel, which would be very foolish.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.600]   David even gives us an explanation of what God was doing in this appointed season of
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   waiting.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.960]   He says that God eventually comes.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.960]   He puts our feet on solid ground.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.760]   He puts a song in our mouth.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.200]   Many see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.160]   In other words, this is evangelism.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:48.920]   This is God's strategy to draw people to trust in him by watching us pass through these pits
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.200]   that we have to wait in.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.840]   The effect of David's waiting and eventual deliverance was, in effect, for the good of
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.960]   other people's faith.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:08.120]   They trust the Lord because David's patient waiting moved them to trust the Lord.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.160]   One of my favorite hymns puts it like this, "He knows the time for joy and truly will
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.360]   send it when he sees it meet.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:26.280]   When he has tried and purged thee duly and found thee free from all deceit."
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:36.840]   So Andrea, God has his purposes for your season of loss and sorrow and even aimlessness.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.760]   Trust him in it.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.880]   Wait patiently for the Lord.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.400]   He will come.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.520]   Psalm 23 says he will restore your soul.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:56.440]   Right now, your soul feels numb, maybe even dead, unresponsive, but that's why you must
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.200]   wait.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.120]   God promises, "I will restore."
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.360]   And the word is "cause to return your soul."
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.240]   It's as if the soul is languishing.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.840]   It's numb.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.840]   It's dead.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.480]   I will restore your soul.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:23.520]   Second, I would say think much about the preciousness of Christ alongside of the preciousness of
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.000]   your husband.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.280]   When your memory calls up sweet and wonderful experiences with your husband, let the power
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:40.760]   of those affections intensify your love for Christ.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:49.360]   Because Ephesians 5 says that your marriage had that aim in the first place.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.400]   Marriage is meant to be a portrayal, a drama of Christ's love for the church and the church's
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.440]   commitment to Christ.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:04.760]   It was meant to help us feel the wonder and pleasure of what a relationship with Christ
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.160]   is like.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:13.760]   So as your memory brings to your mind and to your heart how much you and your husband
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:20.760]   loved each other and how committed you were to each other, translate those affections,
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:30.400]   or you could use the musical analogy of transpose those affections into another key so that
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:39.760]   the husband love is translated into, transposed into the music of Christ love.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.120]   Say something like this to your husband.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.700]   I miss you so much.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.800]   You were very, very precious to me.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.640]   There is a huge hole in my life where you were.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.000]   So Jesus, I know you are even more precious than that.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.080]   If I did not have you, Jesus, I would miss my very life.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.920]   There would be a great unfillable hole in my soul.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.560]   But I do have you, Jesus, and you are my true husband.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:26.520]   I pray that you would help me feel for you and more the intensity of what I feel for
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.040]   the man I have lost.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.040]   Something like that.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:40.600]   I think the reason God gives us so much pleasure in our spouse is to give us a taste of the
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   pleasure that there is in belonging to Jesus.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:54.160]   And so it follows that the pain we feel with the loss of our spouse can be another intensification
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.240]   of what it means to belong to Christ.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:07.240]   And then third, I would say pray Psalm 139 verses 23 and 24.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.480]   Touch me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.680]   Try me and know my thoughts.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:21.200]   See if there be any grievous way in me and lead me in the way everlasting.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:29.320]   And the reason I say this is because we should always honestly reckon with the possibility
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:39.040]   that our love for our spouse could be a disordered love, meaning it might be encroaching on our
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.240]   love for Jesus.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:47.200]   Jesus said, "Whoever loves family members more than me is not worthy of me."
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:54.640]   So we should regularly go before the Lord and ask him to reveal our hearts.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:05.040]   "Lord, is there anything, is there anyone who is competing with you for my supreme affections?"
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:14.320]   Because if that happens, it will almost certainly make the loss of that person more disabling
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.640]   than it ought to be.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:23.000]   And then finally, number four, while you're waiting for the Lord to restore your joy and
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:34.120]   purposefulness, ask him to reveal what he aims to teach you in this season that you
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:40.360]   could learn from him and from the Christian life in no other way.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:47.280]   And the reason I say that is because of Psalm 119 verses 67 and 71.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.280]   They're amazing.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:54.600]   "Before I was afflicted, I went astray, but now I keep your word."
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:03.520]   Or verse 71, "It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn your statutes."
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.480]   In other words, don't waste your sorrow, Andrea.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:14.040]   Don't waste the season of loss.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:19.000]   God has gifts for you and through you for others.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.640]   Ask him what they are and then take hold of them.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:30.720]   Perhaps write them in a journal and then let him use you in the lives of others.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   He will set your feet on a rock.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.360]   He will put a new song in your mouth.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.560]   Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.840]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the very honest question, Andrea, and for
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.400]   bringing us into your life like this.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.960]   And if you want to ask Pastor John a question of your own, type it out, email it to us at
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.600]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.120]   That's our email address.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.120]   Askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:07.680]   Well, a lot of youth ministries focus on topical messages about life application.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.240]   That's their main focus.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.800]   But one youth pastor has been wondering if a better way forward is to preach expositional
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.560]   messages through whole books of the Bible.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.200]   Next time, Pastor John will share three key considerations for how to use youth meetings
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.140]   to build students into a deeper understanding of their Bibles and to set them up for a deeper
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.240]   encounter with God.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.240]   I'm your host, Tony Barenke.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.440]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.440]   [END]
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:31.440]   1
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:40.480]   <i>... And I still cry every time I wake up because the world I live in is not fair.</i>
