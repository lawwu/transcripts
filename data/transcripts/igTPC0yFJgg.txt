[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.160]   - So the magic of deep learning
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.680]   is that it gets better with data.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.040]   You said there's a huge inflow of data,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.560]   but the thing about driving,
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.160]   the really valuable data to learn from is the edge cases.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.960]   So how do you, I mean, I've heard you talk somewhere
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.640]   about autopilot disengagement being an important moment
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.400]   of time to use.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.680]   Is there other edge cases,
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.040]   or perhaps can you speak to those edge cases,
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.100]   what aspects of them might be valuable,
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.560]   or if you have other ideas,
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.640]   how to discover more and more and more edge cases in driving?
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.800]   - Well, there's a lot of things that are learned.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.280]   There are certainly edge cases where,
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.520]   I say somebody's on autopilot and they take over,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.840]   and then, okay, that's a trigger that goes to a system
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.600]   that says, okay, did they take over for convenience,
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.560]   or did they take over because the autopilot
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.820]   wasn't working properly?
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.280]   There's also, like let's say we're trying to figure out
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.720]   what is the optimal spline for traversing an intersection.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.800]   Then the ones where there are no interventions
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.080]   are the right ones.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.800]   So you then say, okay, when it looks like this,
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.800]   do the following.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.080]   And then you get the optimal spline
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.220]   for navigating a complex intersection.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.760]   - So that's for, so there's kind of the common case.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.720]   You're trying to capture a huge amount of samples
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.480]   of a particular intersection, when things went right,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.680]   and then there's the edge case where, as you said,
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.480]   not for convenience, but something didn't go exactly right.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.520]   - Somebody took over, somebody asserted manual control
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.480]   from autopilot.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.440]   And really, like the way to look at this is view
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.320]   all input as error.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.080]   If the user had to do input, if there's something,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.320]   all input is error.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.760]   - That's a powerful line to think of it that way.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.240]   (upbeat music)
