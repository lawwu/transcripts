[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   - Thank you for coming tonight.
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.580]   It means a lot that you'd come and listen to a talk
[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.180]   on a Thursday evening about how to read a book.
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.480]   I'm guessing I don't need to get your attention
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.300]   'cause you're interested, you're here.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.240]   So the title of this address is the title
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.840]   of one of my forthcoming books,
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.360]   How to Read a Book, Advice for Christian Readers.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.880]   That book should release in March 2024 with Canon Press
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.420]   and in this talk, my goal is to just sketch
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.200]   the basic outline of that book
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.360]   and it's gonna be painful to pass over
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.440]   a lot of interesting anecdotes and illustrations
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.960]   and fuller explanations along the way
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.820]   but I trust you'll get the gist of the book.
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.080]   Now when you see that title,
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.200]   you probably have the same question
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.260]   that so many people have had when I told them
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.280]   I wrote a book called How to Read a Book
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.460]   and the question is,
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.440]   didn't Mortimer Adler write a book by that title?
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.360]   So there's the book.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.600]   Yes, it's called How to Read a Book,
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.640]   the Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.180]   So then the next question is,
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.680]   how does your book differ from that book?
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.200]   Well first off, book titles are not copyrighted
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.660]   so I'm safe there.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.480]   Adler's book is an influential book and rightly so.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.000]   Curious, how many of you have read that book?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.600]   Like the whole thing?
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.460]   Wow, okay, a lot of people own the book
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.080]   but they actually read it, that's good.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.740]   So we have a literate crowd here.
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.960]   I'm indebted to Mortimer Adler.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.640]   I don't intend for my book to replace his
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.440]   but my book differs with his in at least seven ways.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.940]   So one is it's written by a Christian.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.000]   Mortimer Adler did not write as a Christian.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.880]   He wrote as a pagan philosopher when he wrote this book.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.760]   And second, my book is specifically for Christians.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.440]   That's why the subtitle of my book
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.640]   is Advice for Christian Readers.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.280]   Third, my book is broader in scope than Adler's book.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.360]   So my book is about not just reading
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.000]   only to increase understanding, which is Adler's focus.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.160]   I'm also talking about reading for pleasure
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.200]   which Adler almost makes fun of.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.520]   Four, my book is more accessible than Adler's book.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.680]   You can see in his title, the subtitle,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.760]   The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.060]   You get a little bit of a whiff there of his,
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.000]   you call it a higher culture approach.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.420]   He has a disdain a little bit
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.080]   for those who don't share his taste for a higher culture.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.680]   And number five, I'm a little bit,
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.680]   a lot a bit more concise than Adler.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.440]   His book is 426 pages long
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.360]   and 120 of that is how to read specific styles of literature
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.880]   like how to read mathematics or how to read philosophy
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.120]   or science or social science.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.280]   And I don't get into that kind of detail.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.080]   And seven, my book's more personal.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.520]   So he sounds like an old school professor
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.560]   who when he writes avoids using the personal pronoun,
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.320]   I or me, no personal stories,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.920]   very old school professor with patches on his elbow type,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.000]   which is interesting,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.520]   but I don't think it's as interesting as you could be.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.920]   And then seven, I think my book's more relevant.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.480]   His book first released in 1940, 1940.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.200]   And then he updated it with Charles Van Doren in 1972.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.000]   So even the update is over 50 years old, 50 years.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.200]   So that was 35 years
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.480]   before the first iPhone released in 2007.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.920]   And readers today have new challenges and questions
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.960]   and I attempt to address those in my book.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.080]   So there's, that question's out of the way.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.300]   You guys were probably wondering that.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.440]   Well, there you go.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.920]   And in this talk going forward,
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.160]   I'm gonna share a lot of lists.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.900]   Don't feel like you have to write them all down.
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's all in the book.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.060]   I'm giving you the gist of it
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.920]   so you can just kind of absorb it.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.820]   Book's coming out in March, 2024.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.320]   So here we go.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.680]   When people ask me what I do for a living,
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.720]   sometimes my answer is I teach people how to read.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.340]   And that means I'm teaching adults how to read carefully.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.340]   So I'm teaching pastors how to read theology well.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.600]   As a pastor, I teach people how to read the Bible well.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.080]   And reading is something that everyone can get better at.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.640]   And my aim in this talk
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.960]   is to help you get better at reading,
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.240]   to take your reading to the next level.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.480]   So here's the plan.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.320]   We'll explore how to read a book
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.160]   by answering four main questions.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.000]   First is why should you read?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.840]   And I'm gonna start here
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.120]   'cause it's pointless to talk about reading
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.600]   and aspects of reading
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.000]   if you're not convinced it's worth doing.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.600]   Second, how should you read?
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.120]   And this is where we often get stuck
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.280]   when it comes to reading.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.320]   We learn the basics of reading,
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.800]   but don't learn how to take it to the next level.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.000]   Third, what should you read?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.260]   Of the amount of reading material available,
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.300]   you can read only a very, very tiny sliver of it.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.440]   And then finally, when should you read?
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.520]   And I'll try to help you strategize
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.520]   how to prioritize quality reading,
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.480]   and then when we're done,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.400]   we'll pause and do some Q&A
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.000]   as long as they'll let us,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.480]   and then we'll break for the evening.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.600]   So let's begin with that first question.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.180]   Why should you read?
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.240]   You should read for at least three reasons.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.920]   The first is read to live.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.720]   What does that mean?
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.240]   I'm thinking what Jesus writes in John 6.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.440]   He says, "The words that I have spoken to you
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.020]   "are spirit and are life."
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.940]   Life.
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.580]   So the most fundamental reason you should read
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.440]   is that you need God's words to truly live.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.440]   This is why Christians value reading so highly.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.760]   Second, read to grow.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.740]   So read not merely to survive,
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.480]   but read to grow, to learn, and develop, and mature.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.500]   So the main reason to read
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.720]   is not so that you can remember facts.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.600]   You'll probably forget most of what you read,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.360]   and that shouldn't be discouraging.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.360]   I had a professor who would tell his students,
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.660]   "I've forgotten more than you'll ever know,"
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.120]   and he was probably right.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.280]   The cash value of reading
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.820]   is not whether you can remember information.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.060]   The benefit of reading is that you grow.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.760]   It's like the food that you eat and drink.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.760]   Do you remember every single piece of food and liquid
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.160]   that you have consumed?
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.700]   Of course not.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.940]   But that doesn't mean that it's all been lacking in value
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.480]   because you can't remember it.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.960]   It's helped keep you alive.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.060]   And reading is like that.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.400]   God can use reading to help you grow,
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.720]   and it can help you grow in at least six areas.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.240]   One is intellectually.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.560]   You can mature intellectually.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.520]   You can increase in how you understand what's true.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.400]   And second, reading can help you mature
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.560]   in how you see reality.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.720]   So a good book can function like time machines
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.280]   that they take you to far off places
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.040]   and different cultures and different times,
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.240]   even fantastical ones.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.800]   And the more time you spend in good books,
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.160]   the larger your view of God's world will be,
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.760]   and thus the more accurate your view of reality will be.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.200]   Third, reading can help you mature spiritually.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.440]   So you can increasingly bear the fruit of the spirit
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.080]   by reading sound teaching and stories,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.800]   and you can be better prepared to suffer when trouble comes.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.080]   Fourth, reading can help you mature emotionally.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.180]   You can learn more about human moods and mindsets
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.180]   by reading good stories and proverbs and poems and studies.
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.540]   And fifth, reading can help you mature
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.440]   in how you communicate.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.640]   So you can learn to communicate more clearly
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.320]   and concisely and colorfully
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.520]   by reading master communicators.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.440]   And then six, reading can help you mature
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.040]   in particular aspects of your vocation.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.240]   So you can learn more facts or techniques or testimonies
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.160]   that can help you improve how you do
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.880]   what God has called you to do,
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.280]   whether that's serving in a household or a church
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.900]   or a society or a nation.
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.840]   So that's the second reason, read to grow.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.520]   Third reason is read to enjoy.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.920]   So you shouldn't read a book
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.780]   so that you can check it off your list
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.380]   as I've read that book,
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.140]   and then broadcast it to other people, I've read that book.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.100]   God invented reading for you
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.220]   so you can enjoy it in a way that honors him.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.560]   And you enjoy God by enjoying his gifts,
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.260]   or you can think of it this way,
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.500]   reading is a gift from God.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.100]   So rather than spurn the gift,
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:11.500]   I actually honor God by enjoying the gift he gave me.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.060]   And what we like to call this
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.400]   at Bethlehem Calvin Seminary is serious joy.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.180]   Read with serious joy.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.460]   So that's why you should read, those three reasons,
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.780]   to live, to grow, and to enjoy.
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.540]   But do you know how to read skillfully?
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.540]   Question two, how should you read?
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.940]   We'll spend the most time on this second question.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.300]   How should you read?
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.780]   So I'm gonna propose seven guidelines
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.500]   for how to read skillfully.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.000]   And the first one is the most important,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.460]   and that's to read carefully.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.280]   What does that mean?
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.540]   To read carefully is to interpret a text
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.260]   by analyzing what the author of that text
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.580]   intended to communicate by his words.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.820]   So let's break down careful reading into five parts.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.940]   It's goal, reason, means, method, and need.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.100]   So the goal of reading, of careful reading,
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.100]   is to understand what the author meant.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.180]   Understanding a text presupposes
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.140]   that the text means what the author meant,
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.380]   and our goal is to discover what a text's author
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.780]   meant to communicate through his written words.
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.940]   The reason for careful reading is the golden rule.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.460]   You must love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.860]   So follow that golden rule.
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.760]   Interpret others as you would like them to interpret you.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.880]   Do you want people to twist your words
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.260]   and say that you meant to communicate something
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.460]   you really didn't mean to communicate?
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.420]   You would hate that.
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.740]   So don't do that to other people.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.100]   A text's meaning is something you discover.
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.600]   It's not something you create.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.060]   The means of careful reading is to look at the fish.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.080]   How many of you know what I mean by that?
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.620]   Okay, yeah, you've been around Bethlehem for a while.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.100]   Okay, so it's an essay from 1879
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.420]   called The Student, the Fish, and Agassiz.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.420]   So a student of natural history recounts
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:15.060]   how his professor taught him to look carefully,
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.380]   and the professor began with this unusual assignment.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.580]   He pulled a fish out of a jar
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.220]   that contained specimen in yellow alcohol,
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.580]   and he asked the student to look at that fish
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.740]   with his naked eye.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.260]   About 10 minutes later,
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.300]   the student thought, "I've looked enough."
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:37.300]   But the professor told him to keep looking for hours.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.820]   The professor kept checking in with the student.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.460]   "Do you see it yet?"
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:46.380]   He kept exhorting, "Look, look, look at the fish."
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.220]   And he kept this up, not just for hours,
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.620]   but for three long days.
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.660]   And the student looked at that fish
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.900]   from every possible angle.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.320]   He felt the inside of the fish
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.660]   and the outside of the fish.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.980]   He drew the fish with pencil on paper,
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.100]   and that helped him see even more details.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.820]   And he didn't realize that there was so much to see,
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.540]   so much he had overlooked the first time
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.820]   when he'd spent 10 minutes
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.940]   superficially looking at the fish.
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.620]   So that's how to read carefully.
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.500]   Look, look, look.
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.540]   Then the method of careful reading
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:21.540]   is to discover what and how the author is communicating.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.940]   That is, trace how the author argues.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.420]   Mortimer Adler calls this coming to terms with the author.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.820]   Does what you understand a text to mean,
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.300]   does that match what the author intended to communicate?
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.220]   So Gene Vaith summarizes the basic forms of literature
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.140]   in three categories, nonfiction, fiction, and poetry.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.900]   He says that nonfiction is the art of truth-telling.
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.780]   Fiction is the art of storytelling.
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.820]   Poetry is the art of singing.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.580]   And you can make an argument
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.340]   with all three styles of literature.
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.260]   And when a book does make an argument,
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.340]   it's crucial to trace how the author is arguing.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.020]   And to trace the argument,
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.780]   you need to understand at least two fundamental concepts,
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.780]   how logic works, and how propositions relate to each other.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.380]   And that's all I'm gonna say about that,
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.140]   but just those two little bits,
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.860]   we could have another three-hour lecture on just that.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.540]   There's a lot there.
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.220]   And then finally here, the need.
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.060]   The need for careful reading
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.700]   is that it is a prerequisite to observe,
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.700]   understand, evaluate, feel, apply, and express.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:31.540]   Careful reading is crucial for educating students.
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.380]   John Piper describes education
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.740]   as instilling six habits of mind and heart.
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.940]   So here's my paraphrase.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.180]   I notice in this figure
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.780]   how the six habits build on one another.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.420]   The first is observe, and that's foundational.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.880]   Observe accurately and thoroughly.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.940]   So are you seeing what's actually there in the text?
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.260]   And then you build on that by understanding.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260]   You understand what you observe clearly.
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.140]   Are you perceiving what the author intended to communicate?
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.940]   And then you evaluate what you've understood fairly.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.140]   Is it true and valuable?
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:18.140]   And then you feel that evaluation in an intense way,
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.140]   intensely and proportionately.
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.940]   So are your emotions in accord with the truth
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.420]   and worth of what you have observed
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.980]   and understood and evaluated?
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.280]   Paul says to abhor what is evil, cling to what is good.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.540]   So you should be loving what God loves
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.160]   and hating what God hates.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.620]   And then five, apply your discoveries
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.740]   to all of life wisely and helpfully.
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.260]   This answers the question, so what?
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.980]   Why does this matter?
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.980]   And then finally, express your discoveries compellingly.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.820]   Can you communicate what you have observed
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.620]   and understood and evaluated and felt and applied
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.280]   in a way that others can know and enjoy that accuracy
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.920]   and clarity and truth and value and helpfulness?
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.980]   So that first guideline about how to read
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.020]   is read carefully.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.380]   The second guideline can revolutionize how you read.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.260]   It's kind of like the difference
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.820]   between riding a one-speed bicycle
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.940]   and riding a multi-speed bicycle,
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.660]   or even riding a motorcycle.
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.300]   And that's this, read at different levels.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.820]   My mentor, D.A. Carson, trained me
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.340]   to read at different levels,
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.380]   and I've adapted a system that works well for me.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.420]   I'll share it with you.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.960]   I read at three different levels,
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.820]   and those levels correspond to the famous advice
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.420]   from the philosopher Francis Bacon.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.380]   Here's what he said.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.760]   "Some books are to be tasted,
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.460]   "others to be swallowed,
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.360]   "some few to be chewed and digested.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.080]   "That is, some books are to be read only in parts,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.600]   "others to be read, but not curiously,
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.520]   "and some few to be read wholly
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.380]   "and with diligence and attention."
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   Those three levels line up with what I call
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.200]   survey, macro-read, and micro-read.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:23.520]   Tasted, read only in part, that's survey.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.640]   Swallowed, read but not curiously, that's macro-read.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.300]   And then chewed and digested, read wholly,
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.160]   with diligence and attention, that's micro-read.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.460]   So, let me define quickly these terms.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.120]   Survey means you quickly and efficiently
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.440]   size up a book without reading every word.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.060]   I'll say more about that in a moment.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.120]   Macro-read is you read every word,
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.280]   but you move quickly to get the big picture.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.480]   And then micro-read, you rigorously observe,
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.480]   understand, and evaluate what you read,
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.500]   and there are various levels to that.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.160]   Most people, when they read a book,
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.480]   they think that micro-read is the only speed to go.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.680]   It's the only kind of reading.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.520]   And that's why some people don't read very much,
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.360]   and if they don't like the book, they get stuck,
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.700]   and then they stop reading.
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.360]   And further, let me give you some analogies
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.120]   for these three.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.280]   You could think surveying is like a helicopter,
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.280]   macro-reading is like a bus ride,
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.500]   and micro-reading is like a bike walk or an excavation.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.720]   Or, the cooking metaphor, surveying is like a microwave,
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.520]   macro-reading is like an oven,
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.840]   and micro-read is like a Crock-Pot or a smoker.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.160]   Is that okay, Jenny?
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.680]   I didn't check that with you, okay.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.520]   We're good.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.560]   Okay, so it may be more helpful
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.880]   to refer to these three levels as layers,
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.120]   and the reason is that the three levels
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.320]   are not distinct kinds of reading,
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.640]   but they're cumulative layers.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.960]   So, surveying is the foundational layer,
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.960]   macro-reading includes and builds on surveying,
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.960]   and then micro-reading builds on surveying and macro-reading.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.520]   So, surveying is the broadest,
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.360]   most general layer of reading,
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.080]   and then micro-reading is the narrowest,
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.520]   most specific layer.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.440]   So, I'm gonna say a few things about each of these.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.320]   I'll start with surveying.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.040]   Surveying is quickly and efficiently sizing up a book
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.160]   without reading every word.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.440]   So, it's learning as much as you can from a book
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.080]   in a short amount of time.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.320]   And some people think this doesn't count as reading,
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.680]   it's not worth doing, they don't think it's valuable.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.520]   So, let me make the case.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.860]   I think this is a valuable skill for at least five reasons.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:38.480]   One is it helps you quickly evaluate a book.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.260]   So, you can ask questions like, who's the author?
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.600]   What's the book's genre?
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.440]   What's it about?
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.380]   What's its thesis?
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.360]   Does the author seem competent?
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.120]   Does the book seem important?
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.800]   Is it interesting?
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.240]   So, when I require my students to survey books
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.900]   for my courses, I specify how long they should spend
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.040]   with a particular resource.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.240]   Like, I might say spend at least 30 minutes
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.580]   with this 300-page book.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.640]   Why am I doing that?
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.480]   I'm trying to train them to read at different levels
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.680]   and I'm introducing them to outstanding tools.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.280]   I don't expect them to master that book in 30 minutes,
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.660]   but I wanna introduce them to a tool
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.720]   so they're more likely to use it in the future.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.760]   Second reason it's valuable, it helps you determine
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.320]   whether you should purchase a book
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.540]   so that you have access to it later.
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.360]   And you probably already do this on Amazon
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.840]   when you check the search inside feature.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.200]   Third, surveying is a valuable skill
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.680]   because it helps you pre-read a challenging book
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.720]   so that you're prepared to macro-read or micro-read it.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.880]   Kinda know what the argument is.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.720]   You can x-ray the book.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.540]   Where are we going?
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.640]   What's the thesis?
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.860]   And then four, it's helpful to determine
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.940]   whether you should stop reading a book.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.640]   Some of you need this gift I'm about to give you.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.480]   Your conscience is condemning you for not completing books.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.000]   You don't have to finish a book.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.680]   If it's a bad book, put it away.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.300]   Read a better book.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.140]   You're welcome.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.040]   And number five, surveying is a valuable skill
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.480]   because it helps you determine
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.420]   whether you should macro-read or micro-read a book.
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.860]   That's surveying.
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.740]   Now, say a few things about these other two.
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.000]   Macro-reading, again, this is,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.260]   if surveying is quickly and efficiently sizing up a book
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.560]   without reading every word,
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.560]   macro-reading includes and builds on that
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.400]   by reading every word,
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.680]   but you move quickly to get the big picture.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.400]   And you can do this by listening to an audio book
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.000]   at a normal speed.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.280]   I listen to a lot of books that way.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.360]   You can move along.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.200]   Third, micro-reading is when you rigorously,
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.760]   rigorously observe, understand, and evaluate what you read.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.700]   So surveying is fast.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.640]   Macro-reading takes much longer.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.000]   Micro-reading takes the longest.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.080]   Micro-reading is the most active reading
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.840]   'cause you're rigorously tracing the argument
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.600]   and marking up the text.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.940]   So that's a third, that's a second guideline
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.800]   is to read at different levels.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.480]   Third guideline, how you should read,
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.320]   is to read systematically, read systematically.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.640]   This refers not to how you read any one book in isolation,
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.180]   but to how you read books in relation to each other.
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.760]   And there are four aspects to reading systematically.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.640]   You analyze.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.280]   You analyze a book when you carefully read it,
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.760]   either surveying, macro-reading, or micro-reading.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.000]   Then diversify.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.600]   You diversify by reading other books,
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.680]   so books on the same topic, books on different topics,
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.640]   books upholding the same perspective and different ones,
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.600]   books in the same genre and different ones.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.440]   And then you compare.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.400]   You compare by noting how various books
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.300]   are similar and dissimilar, and then you synthesize.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.800]   You synthesize by perceiving how various books
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.760]   interrelate and integrate.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.080]   So categorizing arguments and approaches
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.340]   is what I'm talking about here.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.080]   You show how they relate to each other.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.400]   Reading systematically is reading comprehensively.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.240]   It requires penetrating insight
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.920]   that's both deep and broad.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.240]   It's the most demanding type of reading,
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.160]   because doing it well requires the ability
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.320]   to think deeply and understand concepts
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.880]   and perceptively make connections and draw conclusions.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.640]   It's hard, and it's wonderful.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.000]   Here's an illustration of one way I did this recently.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.360]   In 2020 and 2021, I became increasingly concerned
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.360]   that our culture was so rapidly making sin look normal
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.280]   and righteousness seem strange.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.560]   And I attempted to make sense of it
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.280]   by reading systematically,
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.760]   which resulted in my writing an article about it,
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.280]   10 resources that have helped me make sense
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.320]   of our current culture and how Christians
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.480]   are responding to it.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.760]   Read a lot more than those 10,
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.600]   but I picked 10 of the most helpful.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.800]   So that's guideline three.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.760]   Guideline four is read repeatedly.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.640]   And I'm speaking about great works.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.920]   Read great works more than once.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.600]   And don't you already know this to be the case?
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.040]   Would any of you ever say,
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.160]   I don't need to read Romans again.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.520]   I've already read it once.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.760]   That's preposterous.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.680]   We know that great literature requires multiple readings,
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.720]   and you can read it regularly for the rest of your life
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.620]   and never plumb the depths of it.
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.520]   So if you read classic literature in junior high
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.040]   and high school, as some of you are doing right now,
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.200]   I know some of you in here who are doing that,
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.860]   does that mean it would be a waste of time
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.080]   to read some of those same books again
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.440]   in college literature courses?
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.640]   Would you say, oh, I don't need to read that again.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.720]   I already read that in high school.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.080]   I read that in junior high.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:40.880]   No, the books should get better with each reading
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.280]   if they're great books.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.480]   And since you should be a more mature person
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.280]   each time you read a book,
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.160]   each reading should be more profitable and pleasurable,
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.400]   at least for the greatest literature.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.760]   Guideline five, read without distractions.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.280]   The most prominent distractions today are gadgets
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.960]   like smartphones and tablets and computers and televisions.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.160]   People are addicted to screens.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.960]   Some of you are checking your screens right now.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.620]   So don't be distractible like Doug the dog,
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:18.520]   the golden retriever in the Pixar movie Up,
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.240]   who gets so easily distracted that at any moment
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.480]   he may snap his head and exclaim, squirrel.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.560]   In order to read well, you've gotta be able to focus.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.320]   And focusing means you gotta put aside distractions.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.480]   So here are four suggestions to do that.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.400]   One, turn off notifications on your devices,
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.080]   your computer, tablet, phone, et cetera.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.480]   Just turn 'em off, keep 'em off.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.160]   Two, don't incessantly check your email or text messages
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.840]   or social media or whatever else distracts you.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.320]   Three, schedule blocks of time to read
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.400]   and treat those blocks of time
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.640]   as do not disturb appointments.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.600]   And four, say no to spending most of your free time
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.800]   watching videos or shows or scrolling social media
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.660]   for eye candy in the form of entertaining pictures
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.720]   and memes and short videos.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.240]   In short, train yourself to develop habits
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:18.240]   that cultivate a taste that prefers reading good books.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   Guideline six, read with eyes to see and ears to hear.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.460]   Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for failing to read
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.820]   with eyes to see and ears to hear.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.620]   What does it mean to read with eyes to see
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.460]   and ears to hear?
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:37.360]   It means to truly understand.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.440]   Read to truly understand.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.680]   That means you should read with a heart posture
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.080]   to faithfully obey God and not rebel against him.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.800]   Sometimes we assume that a guy doesn't understand the truth
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.240]   because he's not thinking hard enough
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.000]   or because he's not smart enough.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.080]   But the reason may actually be that he's watching shows
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.120]   with sexually charged nudity in them.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.360]   That's why it's so important to read with a heart posture
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.780]   that is submitting to God
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.680]   and that is not rebelling against him.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:13.220]   Guideline seven, read with serious joy.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.800]   That phrase may sound like an oxymoron, but it's not.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   To read with serious joy is to read with thoroughgoing,
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:28.200]   wholehearted, energetic joy.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.960]   I'm following C.S. Lewis here.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.320]   He says that a serious reader is not a solemn reader
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   in the sense of an unsmiling, long-faced, but thoroughgoing.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.800]   Instead of that, he calls it, this is a quote from him,
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.640]   it's thoroughgoing, wholehearted, and energetic.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.360]   It's genuine, it's resolute, it's earnest.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.400]   That's how we should read.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.840]   And I should qualify that reading for pleasure
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.780]   doesn't always mean reading without challenge.
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.040]   We like to do things with challenge,
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.160]   like hiking up a tall mountain.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.920]   That's hard, and it's rewarding and enjoyable.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.520]   And reading can be like that.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.720]   Read a great book to stretch you.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.320]   So that's how to read, seven guidelines.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.320]   But you won't be putting your skills to good use
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.440]   if you're reading the wrong book.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:18.040]   So that leads to question three, what should you read?
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.400]   So here are seven quick recommendations what to read.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.560]   Obviously the first one is,
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.560]   read the book by the author of life.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.320]   God wrote a book.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.680]   God wrote a book.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.620]   Reading the Bible matters more
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.400]   than everything else you read combined.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.120]   Prioritize reading God's words over man's words
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.460]   every single day.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.280]   Make it automatic.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.520]   Recommendation two, read what helps you be vigilant
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.240]   about your character and doctrine.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.520]   So here are three specific examples
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.960]   of how God has used writings
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.920]   to help me be vigilant about how I live.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.000]   One, meditating on specific passages of scripture
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.720]   helps me focus on the type of character that God esteems.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.080]   Two, outside the Bible,
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.800]   the stories that have most formed my character by far
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.320]   are the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.680]   And I'm not embarrassed to say that.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.740]   I still listen to those.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.400]   I've lost count.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.600]   It's 50, 100, 150, I don't know.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.200]   It's a lot.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.920]   I started when I was a kid, and I haven't stopped.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.760]   Here's an example.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.620]   When everyone around you is believing lies,
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.940]   what you need is the smell of burnt marsh wiggle.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.500]   And if you don't know what I'm talking about,
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.720]   you need to read The Silver Chair.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.740]   Third example, the years 2020 and 2021
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.220]   were unusually difficult for many leaders,
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.320]   including pastors and professors in America.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   And some leaders wilted under emotional pressure
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.140]   from highly reactive people
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.640]   in the midst of tensions about politics,
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.220]   ethnic partiality, the infectious COVID-19 disease,
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.100]   and government lockdowns, and mask mandates,
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.660]   and vaccinations, and intolerant demands
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.560]   growing from expressive individualism.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.340]   Sorry if I'm bringing back bad memories for you all.
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.340]   During this turmoil, I read a book
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.720]   called The Failure of Nerve by Edwin Friedman.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.940]   Not a Christian.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.380]   I was astounded with his common grace insights
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.500]   about leadership that applied directly
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.100]   to parents and pastors and professors.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:38.980]   I learned that good leaders are stable and sober-minded.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.460]   Good leaders don't anxiously react
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.980]   to highly reactive people by hurting the whole group
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.980]   to adapt to the least mature members of the group.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.260]   Good leaders don't let criticism ruin them.
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.800]   Good leaders recognize that criticism
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.700]   comes with the territory of good leadership.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.420]   That was helpful, that was really helpful.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.740]   Reading books can help you in that way.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.840]   Here's a third recommendation, what to read.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.520]   Read what helps you excel at what God has called you to do.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.000]   So if you're a Christian, God has called you
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.200]   to be a faithful church member.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.400]   If you're a male, God has called you to be a faithful man,
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.240]   son, brother, husband, father, grandfather.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.840]   If you're female, God's called you to be a faithful woman,
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.240]   daughter, sister, wife, mother, grandmother.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.960]   God has called individuals to do various jobs,
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.920]   paid and unpaid.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.000]   God has called us to all kinds of worthy vocations.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.080]   So read what helps you excel
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.520]   at what God has called you to do.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.680]   Suggestion, or recommendation four,
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.000]   is read what helps you better understand reality.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.960]   Better understanding reality
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.520]   helps you better understand and worship God.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.800]   So here are three overlapping categories of books
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.100]   that can help you better understand reality.
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:53.200]   Great books, stories about history, and fiction.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.480]   So I'll say something briefly about each of these.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.000]   First, great books.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.920]   The category great books typically refers to classics,
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.280]   like Plato's Republic.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.400]   So classic books have earned their privileged position
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.300]   by proving to generations that they're top quality.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.760]   Does everything in the classics
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.360]   align with what the Bible teaches?
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.940]   Not even close, if you read the Greek myths.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:21.940]   So every non-inspired book we read requires discernment.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.720]   In such cases, as Augustine argues,
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.160]   Christians may glean from the classics
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.440]   similar to how the Egyptians, excuse me,
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.400]   how the Israelites plundered the Egyptians
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.800]   to decorate the tabernacle.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.200]   Great books can help you mature,
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.840]   to develop stable, sober-mindedness.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:45.620]   Great books can help stress test what you believe
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.760]   by subjecting you to contrary ideas
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.440]   and by helping you form
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.780]   deep-rooted convictions about reality.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.680]   That's why my daughters are reading books
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.360]   in the Integrated Humanities or Omnibus courses
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.120]   from Logos Online School.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.320]   It's why the Bethlehem College features Omnia,
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.820]   an extended academic core.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:10.920]   Bethlehem College refers to our strategy as great books
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.600]   in light of the greatest book
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.040]   for the sake of the Great Commission.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.080]   So that's great books.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.400]   And then stories about history.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.360]   This is my favorite way to learn history.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.280]   It's so much more interesting to learn about
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.080]   key names and dates and events
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.880]   in the context of a gripping story
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.540]   that makes it feel like you know the main characters.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.280]   And then fiction.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:35.220]   I quit reading fiction in college and graduate school
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.620]   so that I could focus on exegesis and theology.
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.240]   And that was a mistake.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.220]   I'm looking at the Comptons right there.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.660]   We were part of the same church for a bit
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.240]   and our pastor, Mike Bulmore, whom we dearly love,
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:51.000]   he was in my home and we were sharing a meal or something
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.760]   and he said, "Hey, so Andy, what fiction are you reading?"
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.520]   I was a PhD student at the time
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.700]   and I kind of, I don't have time for fiction.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.600]   I thought that was a good answer,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.400]   that he would be pleased with me.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.600]   And he said, "Oh, Andy."
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:09.520]   And he gave me a gentle rebuke and I took it to heart.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.800]   You need fiction.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.720]   Why?
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.120]   Reading good fiction is valuable for at least three reasons.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:20.120]   One, it helps you better understand God and God's creation,
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.520]   particularly human nature.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.960]   Second, good fiction engages your mind and imagination
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.000]   and emotions in a way that nonfiction doesn't.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.480]   And third, good fiction is a gift from God for us to enjoy
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.680]   and we should treasure God by enjoying his gifts.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.720]   So read what helps you better understand reality.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.160]   That's the fourth recommendation.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.260]   Number five, read what you wholesomely enjoy.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:52.040]   The type of reading I'm describing here is pure leisure.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.960]   It's reading for pleasure, reading for joy.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.960]   It's what Alan Jacobs calls reading at whim, W-H-I-M.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.020]   In C.S. Lewis's The Screwtape Letters,
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.000]   the senior demon Screwtape rebukes
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.240]   his apprentice Wormwood.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.480]   He says, "You first of all allowed the patient
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.440]   "to read a book he really enjoyed because he enjoyed it
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.620]   "and not in order to make clever remarks about it
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.100]   "to his new friends."
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.820]   He's showing how that's a satanic device.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.160]   Satan and his demons don't want you to read
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.560]   what you wholesomely enjoy.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:34.000]   Recommendation six, read what models outstanding writing.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.200]   If you want to write well, then read outstanding writers.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.360]   And recommendation seven, read what people you respect
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.240]   and trust recommend.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.780]   There's just too many reading options
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.600]   for one person to filter.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.360]   It's much wiser to work as a team
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.040]   and learn from the reading recommendations
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.200]   of people you respect and trust.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:01.200]   So those are why, how, and what you should read.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.840]   There's one last practical question to ask,
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.240]   and that's when should you read?
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.560]   The short answer to that is read whenever you can.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.040]   And I put an asterisk there.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.940]   Read whenever you responsibly can.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.240]   So here are seven tips for making reading
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.640]   part of your routine.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.880]   Number one, start small.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.360]   It's better to read something good,
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.000]   something good, than to read nothing at all.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.040]   Even if that means you're starting
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.640]   with just five minutes a day.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.840]   So you may not be able to run a marathon today,
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.460]   but could you walk around a track one time?
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.680]   Just walk?
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.980]   So start small, gradually go further
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.700]   as your endurance increases.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.200]   Tip two, plan what to read.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.380]   Develop a feasible reading plan.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.960]   Don't worry about getting it perfect.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.480]   You can tweak it along the way.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.240]   But having a plan is better than having no plan.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.520]   So here are four suggestions to help you plan what to read.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.400]   First, follow a Bible reading plan.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.520]   And don't worry about getting behind.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.160]   What matters most is that you're constantly
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.680]   feeding on God's word.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.080]   And second, plan to diversify your reading.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.080]   So various time periods, old and new,
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.520]   diverse styles of literature.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.380]   Read multiple books at a time.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:20.540]   Have a handful of options, like a weighty theological book,
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.420]   like Calvin's Institutes.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:26.100]   An accessible devotional, like J.I. Packer's Knowing God.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.980]   Some fiction my daughter would like,
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.040]   maybe Victor Hugo's Les Mis.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.400]   A biography, like Ian Murray on Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.780]   A current event book, current events book,
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:40.020]   like say Thomas Sowell on race and economics.
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.620]   One of those books may strike you as particularly appealing
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.900]   at different times of the day.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.540]   So it's good to have different options.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.340]   And then plan to study a particular topic.
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.860]   You may decide to study a portion of scripture in depth.
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.080]   Or you may want to study an influential
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.940]   and destructive ideology, like critical theory,
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.260]   or the prosperity gospel.
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.620]   So that's tip number two, plan what to read.
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:08.300]   Tip three, listen to audio books.
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.180]   Some of you are tissing right now.
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.020]   You're a purist.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:11.840]   You're a purist, and you say,
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.900]   "An audio book doesn't count as reading."
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.860]   And my reply to that is, that's nonsense.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.380]   It's merely a different kind of reading,
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.140]   in which someone else is reading aloud.
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.100]   Audio books are awesome.
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.460]   I love 'em.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.740]   And I would like you to love them too.
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.380]   So here are 11 benefits of audio books.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.100]   I'll go fast.
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.660]   I'm serious, I'm gonna prove it.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.020]   Number one, audio books are convenient
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.800]   when it would be difficult to read a print book.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.300]   And I'm cutting out paragraphs
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.660]   under each one of these statements.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.660]   Audio books are convenient to store,
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.740]   convenient to transport, can be easier,
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.820]   can be easier to understand and remember.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.860]   They're an incredible deal.
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.660]   Okay, let me say something about that.
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.620]   An audio book enables you to listen
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.220]   to a professional read aloud to you
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:06.620]   at any time you want, at any speed and volume,
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.600]   that you can adjust along the way.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.540]   How cool is that?
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.380]   Six, audio books can be delightful.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.680]   My favorite reader is Jim Dale.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.740]   He brilliantly narrates the Harry, not narrates,
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.660]   he performs the Harry Potter books.
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.900]   My second favorite reader is Andy Serkis,
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.580]   who masterfully performs Tolkien's The Hobbit
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:27.460]   and The Lord of the Rings.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.300]   He's the actor who plays Gollum in the movies,
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.760]   which is one thing the movies got just right.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.600]   Seven, the audio books give your eyes a break.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.720]   Eight, audio books can be a better option
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.220]   than reading with your eyes,
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.860]   especially for books you wanna macro read.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.460]   Like, I like audio books for listening
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.620]   to biographies and histories and novels.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.840]   Nine, audio books can helpfully supplement
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.280]   certain books with your eyes.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.280]   I love to listen to the Bible.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.500]   10, audio books can enhance visual reading,
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.420]   so you can engage multiple senses
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.220]   by reading with your ears and your eyes at the same time.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.080]   And audio books are ideal for road trips.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.260]   That's just 11 that come to mind.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:13.240]   Okay, tip four, plan when and where to read.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.660]   Have you thought strategically about where you read?
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:21.920]   You can read while you're sitting or standing,
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.260]   stationary or moving, so figure out ideal combinations
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.440]   of place and time for your optimal reading.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.360]   And here are six times you could plan when to read.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.140]   Shortly after you wake up,
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.300]   I think that's an ideal time to feed on God's words.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.420]   You create a routine so that your reading time
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.220]   and spot is consistent and automatic.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.220]   Read during scheduled blocks of time.
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:47.460]   Put it in your calendar, and when someone asks
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.660]   if you're free at that time, you can say no.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.460]   You don't have to tell them why.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:55.400]   Third, read during predictable, redeemable times.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.520]   This could be while you're walking
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.400]   or traveling or showering.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.260]   It's possible.
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.740]   Read during unscheduled free times,
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.060]   like when you're waiting in line or stuck in traffic
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.180]   or waiting for a meeting to start.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.660]   Read before you go to sleep.
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:14.340]   Fantastic way to end the day and prepare for deep sleep.
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.660]   And then read on retreats and vacations.
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.180]   Just schedule half a day or an entire day or more
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.700]   to rest and relax by reading.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:24.120]   Tip five, read consistently.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:29.740]   Would you rather eat one amazing meal one time a week
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:34.660]   or eat three times a day smaller bits for every day?
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.180]   And the answer is, yeah, I'd rather eat regularly, right?
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.940]   Treat reading like you treat eating.
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.060]   Prioritize a daily reading routine
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.780]   over reading big chunks sporadically.
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.100]   But it doesn't have to be either/or.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.860]   You could devote larger chunks to reading,
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.460]   like on a Sunday afternoon.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.680]   You could sit down and read a whole book
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.780]   of the Bible at one time.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.120]   The key is that you read consistently.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.660]   So make a plan, stick with it.
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.140]   Tip six, read with others.
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.740]   So you can team up with a friend or a group of friends
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.900]   to discuss what you read,
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.600]   and that will help you read carefully.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.940]   And more systematically,
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.620]   and you can benefit from the insights of other people.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.980]   And tip seven, read responsibly.
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.780]   So C.S. Lewis distinguishes two types of reading.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:18.400]   He calls it escape and escapism.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.460]   He says escape is fine, escapism is not.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.860]   The point is that there's more to life than reading.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.620]   And too much of a good thing is not good.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.300]   If you drink too much water,
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.080]   you can die of water intoxication.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.180]   So do good things proportionately.
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.220]   You have many responsibilities as a Christian,
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:37.780]   and you would be disobeying God
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.580]   if you choose to read so much
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.300]   that you fail to meet those other obligations.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:47.100]   So, those are my very concise answers
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.740]   to the four big questions.
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:49.940]   Why should you read?
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:50.980]   How should you read?
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.180]   What should you read?
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.580]   And when should you read?
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:56.340]   And now it's your turn to ask some questions and some Q&A.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.660]   So just go ahead and raise your hand, I'll call on you.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:59.980]   And I'll repeat your question,
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.460]   and we'll go until someone asks us to stop.
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:05.300]   So who would like to ask the first question about reading?
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.820]   Yes, sir, Brian D. White.
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.420]   - What fiction are you reading right now?
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.400]   - What fiction am I reading right now?
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.140]   Well, I can show you on my phone, actually.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.140]   So, I don't read, yeah,
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.020]   I don't think I read any fiction with my eyes.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:20.940]   That might sound bad to some of you.
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.900]   The reason is I use my eyes for reading on the screen
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.740]   pretty much all day.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:31.460]   And if I can enjoy reading in another mode
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:34.220]   with just my ears while I'm driving or walking
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.820]   or working out or something, I prefer that.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:41.820]   So there is a book by,
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.460]   it's Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle,
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.520]   and it's read by Stephen Fry,
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.420]   who's got an amazing British voice.
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.380]   And if you subscribe to Audible,
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.020]   you can stream it from Audible.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.380]   It's, it's good.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.700]   I've listened to the, or read the Sherlock Holmes
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:01.680]   many times, but this is my favorite time so far.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.340]   Right there.
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:05.980]   - How do you read false teaching,
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.980]   or if you should read false teaching?
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.820]   - How do I read false teaching
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.260]   if I should read false teaching?
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.260]   I'm a, I'm a pastor and professor,
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.880]   which means I read a lot of bad things
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.260]   for the sake of other people to help them,
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.300]   because one of my jobs is to root out error
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.100]   and destroy bad arguments and understand Satan's schemes.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.980]   My other title, my unofficial title
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.620]   is I'm professor of defense against the dark arts.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.060]   So I take that seriously.
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.060]   So I read bad teaching daily,
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:38.980]   and I do it with more seriousness than with joy.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:42.540]   And my mindset is I want to love what's true
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:45.580]   and root out what's false for the sake of the church.
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.420]   So I read it carefully.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.180]   My goal is to understand it accurately
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.460]   and to represent it fairly,
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.900]   such that if I represent someone's position,
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.140]   they would say, yeah, that's my view.
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.700]   You said it better than I could myself.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.060]   Never want to misrepresent a view,
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:02.100]   but represent it fairly in the best possible way,
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.440]   and then show where it fails.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.340]   So did you have more in mind there?
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.980]   Okay.
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.660]   Right back here and then here.
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.860]   Is that Jared?
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:12.700]   Okay.
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.100]   - So in the books over again,
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.900]   periodicals and other kinds of reading.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:23.340]   - Yeah, he's asking about books versus articles,
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.700]   blog posts, news articles, that sort of thing.
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.500]   And I say in the book manuscript,
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.140]   my advice for books applies
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.380]   to all those other kinds of reading.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.940]   It's just, those are smaller units.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.180]   So the way you can survey an article,
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.300]   you can do that with, excuse me,
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.220]   the way you survey a book,
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.840]   you can do with an article as well.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.100]   Same skillset, just less time.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.980]   So is there more you're wondering there?
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.700]   - What percentage are you--
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.420]   - Oh, what percentage?
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.260]   I don't--
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.220]   - Are you curious about that?
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.340]   - It's probably 50/50,
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:59.020]   'cause I keep track of over 100 theological journals,
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.340]   which come out multiple times a year.
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.980]   So I'm constantly downloading those.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.580]   I keep track of a couple hundred blogs by RSS feeds,
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.420]   and then I have Twitter feeds.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.920]   I'm processing a lot of those.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.180]   I saw a hand over here.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.020]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.180]   - When this book releases in March,
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.740]   will there be an audio book available?
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.340]   - Yes, I plan to read it myself.
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.260]   He asked, will my book have an audio book?
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.180]   And I've asked Canon Press,
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.140]   I would like to read it,
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.860]   because I prefer to listen to an audio book
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.380]   by the author, read by the author.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.620]   Even if he doesn't have a professional voice,
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.420]   I think he will pronounce things correctly
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.900]   and emphasize things correctly.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.540]   It's just more interesting.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.660]   So if they let me.
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.980]   They said I have to do a trial submission,
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:38.920]   and if I pass their test, then it will be me.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.000]   Okay.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:40.840]   Good luck.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.700]   And here we say good providence.
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.300]   All right, so right here.
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.140]   Mr. Siegel.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:50.580]   - So, Karen Swalwell Pryor,
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.280]   written a lot about writing and reading,
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.140]   had a piece in that Baptist theology book
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:01.620]   where she raised, it was a thoughtful article
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.260]   in which she talked about the challenges
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.100]   that we face in ministry
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:12.380]   in what appears to be a post-Christian culture
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.580]   emerging around this,
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.700]   is made all the more complicated
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.860]   by an emerging post-literate culture.
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:27.220]   And that person's obvious challenges
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:31.420]   to us, to his faith, to his ministry,
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.860]   to the gospel depends on books and on readings.
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.240]   My question would be,
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.540]   do you share this view of an emerging
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.300]   post-literate culture,
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:48.300]   and what are we to do about that?
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.340]   - Good question.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.660]   He's asking, do I think that we live
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.560]   in a post-literate culture,
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.100]   and do I have any concerns about that?
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.980]   The answer is, if you defend post-literate
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.940]   meaning people aren't as good at reading
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.380]   as they used to be, yes.
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:02.580]   It doesn't mean that people in our culture
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:03.860]   can't read, per se.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.020]   It's just their idea of reading is scrolling Instagram
[00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.460]   and looking at the captions under the pictures.
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.300]   That's reading.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.220]   And that makes it really hard to communicate
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.240]   the most important truths seriously,
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.380]   which makes preaching harder,
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.360]   because it's hard for people to listen
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:23.380]   to a sustained argument for 40 minutes.
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.380]   It makes teaching harder,
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.400]   'cause people's attention spans are warped,
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:31.100]   and they can't, maybe some of you can attest to this.
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.220]   I just think back 25 years,
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:35.340]   when I was working on papers,
[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:36.940]   and then working on dissertations,
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:41.540]   I would regularly spend four, five, 10-hour stretches
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.660]   in my study with no internet access,
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.660]   lost in my books, lost in my own world,
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.940]   no email to check, no phone ringing,
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:54.260]   didn't have a phone, just immersed in the literature.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.660]   And that was fun, and I was focused,
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.560]   and that was normal.
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.980]   And now, you think I'd be more mature about it, right?
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.820]   I'd be even better at it.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.880]   Now, I read not just a chapter of a book,
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.180]   I read a section of a book,
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.820]   and without thinking, I switch over
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.860]   to my email application and hit refresh.
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.300]   I hate that, I hate that.
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.140]   If that's happening to me,
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:21.400]   it's gotta be happening to other people, right?
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.820]   And you're all guilty, aren't you?
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.740]   Yeah, over here, and then over here, yep.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:29.660]   - Do you have any advice for readers
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.420]   with disabilities, advice I could give?
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.820]   - Yes, I do.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:39.200]   He asks about readers with dyslexia.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.920]   Do you wanna come up and say something about that?
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.680]   No, she has read books and books about that,
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.360]   'cause she's an educator, my wife,
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.360]   and just knows more than I do.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.760]   But what you can do is recognize
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.060]   that someone with dyslexia is not dumb.
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.060]   Sometimes they're way smarter than you are,
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.900]   it's just they have a challenge in a way that you don't.
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.020]   And they can take in, for example,
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.280]   someone else reading a book,
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.220]   and understand it better than the average person.
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:09.120]   Their mental abilities are sharp, and they're all there.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:13.820]   And this is where that person's parents, teachers,
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.280]   need to learn different tools and techniques
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.600]   to help them get over certain barriers
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.100]   where they can learn to overcome that impediment
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.020]   and still succeed well.
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.000]   And it can be done.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   There are many people in this room who've done that,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.120]   I know, and who love it.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.000]   There's a lot more to say.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.320]   If you have specifics,
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.520]   come talk to me afterwards, or talk to my wife.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.340]   Right there.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.920]   - I'm wondering, in a non-fiction domain,
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:41.640]   where you're trying to capture a lot of ideas,
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.840]   a lot of perspectives, and terms,
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.800]   and propositions, and that kind of thing,
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.160]   and you went and archived those, and managed that,
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.920]   and then be able to synthesize that,
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.860]   and keep track of it, and so forth,
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:57.280]   do you just use paper resources,
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.840]   or do you have digital, or do you have lots of digital
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.480]   note-taking applications that you use any of that technology?
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.720]   - The question is, how do you rigorously follow,
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:09.880]   trace an argument when you're reading?
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.060]   Do you take notes in some way?
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.080]   And personally, what I do is I take notes
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.100]   in the item I'm reading.
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:19.920]   So if I own it in print, I always have a pen or pencil,
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.360]   and I'm marking it up.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.640]   So you can actually pick up books I've read.
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.600]   Kara did this the other day.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.580]   She read Desiring God by John Piper,
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.000]   and it had my markings in it from the '90s,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.800]   and she would come, "Dad, you wrote this in the margin.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.840]   "Do you still believe that?"
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.060]   Like, "Uh, no, I probably wouldn't say it like that."
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:36.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.000]   So I argue with the books.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.160]   It's kind of fun to go back and look.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:42.760]   If I'm in Logos software, or with a PDF,
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:43.680]   I'm marking it up right there.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.540]   If I don't own the book, if it's a library book,
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.080]   I use a program called Zotero,
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.480]   and it has a note option in there,
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.960]   and I'm taking notes there.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.360]   When I take the most detailed notes
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.960]   is when I'm going to review that book.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.500]   So if I'm reviewing a book,
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.080]   or I'm gonna be using it real carefully
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.160]   in something I'm writing,
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.800]   I'm taking very detailed notes.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.480]   Sometimes I will write the outline of the book
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:06.120]   in a separate document so I can compare.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:07.360]   My favorite, I love this, by the way,
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.140]   when a book has not just a bare-bones table of contents,
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:12.880]   but has a detailed table of contents,
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.520]   an analytical outline that has all the headings
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:16.760]   and subheadings.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.600]   I love that.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.180]   That helps you X-ray a book to get its big idea.
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:23.440]   Is that helping a little bit?
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.820]   Okay, other questions?
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.000]   Right here.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.920]   - So how can I encourage my family members
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.180]   to love and enjoy reading,
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:36.180]   but they are interested in like a book about YouTube,
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:38.240]   or they've just been distracted by that?
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:42.200]   How do you encourage them to love reading?
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.040]   - Good question.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.440]   Basically, how do I encourage family members
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.880]   to love reading when they're distracted
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.460]   by YouTube and other things?
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:51.040]   I have an appendix in my book.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:51.880]   I forget the title.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:55.160]   I think it's 22 Ways to Encourage Your Children
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.800]   to Love Reading, something like that.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.040]   So I won't read the whole thing to you here,
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.560]   but it starts when they're young.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.200]   My wife has been a master at this.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.540]   So since our kids have been young,
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.680]   she would come home every week
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.880]   with about 100 books from the library.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.120]   It's harder to do with the libraries now
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.640]   'cause they have all these LGBT books for the kids.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.140]   It's really bad.
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:18.400]   But having a home that focuses on books, books everywhere,
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.720]   use them all the time,
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.240]   don't have big screens all over the place,
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.400]   or little screens all over the place.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.560]   Just make it a book paradise.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.160]   Give books for gifts, for them to own
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.000]   and build their library.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.400]   Talk about books all the time.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.320]   Be a reader yourself.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:33.120]   Read aloud, read aloud in the morning.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.320]   My wife reads the Bible aloud at breakfast.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:38.160]   She reads some kind of classic story after lunch.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.900]   I often read in the evenings after dinner.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.900]   The girls often listen to audio books together before bed.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.800]   It's just, it's just in our cycle.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.440]   It's in our routine, reading, listening to books.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.840]   And then they do it for fun when they have free time.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.400]   So it's kind of, it's like when you wanna cultivate
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.240]   a taste for good food,
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.700]   you can't just change something overnight
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:01.120]   if you've developed a love for really poor food.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.720]   You have to do it gradually.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.760]   But you can change your tastes.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.320]   It can be done so that you actually enjoy good food.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.520]   I think that's what reading is like.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.800]   Good question, right here.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.200]   - How do you distinguish between great books and fiction?
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.960]   - How do you distinguish between great books and fiction?
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.200]   - What's your distinction?
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.500]   - Well, some great books include fiction.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:26.680]   But I was thinking that the category great books
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:30.680]   includes fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.620]   And then a subset of that is fiction
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:35.220]   that's not great books.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.880]   So an example of fiction that is not
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.080]   in the great books category
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.080]   might be like a modern novel about a Navy SEAL
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.120]   that I find interesting.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.840]   That's not great books.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.200]   But I could enjoy it.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:54.700]   But reading "The Odyssey," that's great books.
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:54:00.280]   And "The Odyssey" is different than "The Odyssey."
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.880]   Okay, right there.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.840]   - When there's a movie out,
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:08.520]   do you recommend reading the book first
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:11.760]   and then watching the movie, or watching the movie first?
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.360]   - She says when there's a movie out
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.380]   that is based on a book,
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.840]   do you recommend watching the movie first
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.960]   or reading the book first?
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.800]   You know what I'm gonna say.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.840]   Read the book and don't watch the movie.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.360]   Next question, yeah.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.040]   Yes, right there.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:32.160]   - How can you micro-read fiction
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.520]   that isn't like great books?
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.400]   - How can you micro-read fiction?
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.120]   I don't think fiction typically is something you micro-read,
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.080]   unless you're analyzing it for a dissertation.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.920]   In general, fiction is just,
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.840]   it's supposed to be for joy.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.620]   And to micro-read it is,
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:49.880]   I think, to over-analyze it,
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.120]   unless you're a professional reader
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.680]   and you're gonna teach on it and write a paper on it.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.420]   Yes, right there.
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:55:00.520]   - How do you survey or macro-read theological books?
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.920]   - Yeah, how do you survey or macro-read theological books?
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.080]   So I have to answer, that's two questions.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.200]   Survey a theological book by,
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:12.240]   well, am I still sharing my screen?
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.860]   I am.
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:14.700]   It would take too long.
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:17.320]   I was gonna navigate by Dropbox to a PDF and show you,
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.700]   but that would take too long.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:21.640]   Basically, I get a lot of,
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.800]   I'm the administrator for Thamelias,
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.160]   and I administrate the book reviews,
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:27.680]   and I get hundreds of books a year from publishers,
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.600]   the books that are about to come out,
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.160]   so we can consider reviewing them.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:33.120]   So as I process these books,
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.560]   I have to process large batches of them
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.380]   and then sort them in my Zotero library quickly.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.480]   So I learn how to look at an author,
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.600]   look at the topic, the title, subtitle,
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.660]   look at the table of contents,
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:46.060]   figure out what is this book about.
[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:47.960]   You can do that in less than a minute.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.160]   That's not that hard.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.960]   Then what I'd wanna do next is figure out,
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.240]   is this something that interests me?
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.360]   Is this an author I trust?
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.940]   Is this a topic I need to know more about?
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.600]   Is this a book that seems like it's gonna be important
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.320]   for my field or for something I'm writing,
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.880]   something I'm teaching, something like that?
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:04.340]   And then I have a, if so, I put it in another folder
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:07.300]   for reading in my reading queue.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:11.080]   And so my attitude towards a book is,
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.480]   there are millions of books to read.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.380]   I'll give you 30 seconds, go.
[00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.100]   You gotta earn everything beyond that.
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.580]   Like, that sounds so pretentious,
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:24.620]   but it's just, life's too short to waste on bad books.
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:27.860]   So my serving is kind of filtering out
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.300]   ones that don't merit the time.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:30.900]   And if I get the sense this is good writing,
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:32.560]   it's a good topic, it's an author I trust,
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.500]   or it looks like this will be an important book
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:38.140]   to interact with, then it'll bump up into,
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:39.340]   let's spend more time serving it.
[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:41.180]   I'll give it a half hour, I'll give it an hour.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:44.340]   And if I, as I'm doing that, and it draws me in,
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.840]   then you know it's a good book.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.240]   Or I was gonna give it 30 minutes,
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.840]   and oh, two hours just went by.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.040]   I'm reading every word.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.240]   I choose to macro-read it.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.760]   So it's gotta earn that.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:56.400]   And the macro-read is this, you're moving along,
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.840]   you're reading every word, you're no longer surveying.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.640]   That's a short answer, but hope that helps a little bit.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.520]   Any other questions?
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.120]   Brian Deck, and then right here.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:09.120]   - Do you use all three levels of reading
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.680]   with Bible consumption?
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.140]   - Do I use all three levels of reading
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.140]   with Bible consumption?
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:15.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:17.100]   But I would survey differently.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.620]   So surveying in the sense of trying to figure out
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:21.980]   what is the theme of a book.
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:22.820]   You know this.
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:24.220]   Did I teach you for New Testament background and message?
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:25.260]   Yeah.
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:30.260]   So I require students to write a one-sentence summary
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:32.140]   of the theological message of every book
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:32.980]   of the New Testament.
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.900]   That's 27 sentences.
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.420]   So that requires surveying,
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.620]   and then macro and micro-reading to do that well.
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:41.920]   But the surveying is like, what's the big idea?
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.080]   What's the structure of this book of the Bible?
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.520]   So if you're reading the book of Matthew,
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.460]   you gotta know there are five discourses
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:51.220]   and five statements or parallels in between each of those,
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:52.300]   and they all fit together,
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.140]   and there's a front and a back,
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:54.260]   and there's a climax.
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:55.620]   Like, you gotta get that structure,
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:56.800]   and you can survey to get that,
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.400]   and then you can jump in.
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.840]   But normally, I'm macro-reading and micro-reading Scripture.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:05.700]   Every morning, wake up, first thing, audible's up,
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:06.720]   I hit play.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.320]   I pick up Bible reading where I left off.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.160]   Every morning.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:14.000]   This morning, I listened to Nahum.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.420]   This is the next thing.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:16.720]   Listen to the next thing.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.420]   It's the slowest speed of all things I listen to.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:21.980]   It's at 1.2.
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:24.180]   For Proverbs, I slow it down to one.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:26.520]   But other than that, I go 1.2.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.540]   But for everything else, it's usually 2.5.
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.100]   It's, we're moving.
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:32.980]   I saw a hand over here, yep.
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:34.500]   - How do you discipline yourself
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:37.380]   to maintain a macro-reading,
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.900]   and then not drop it down to micro?
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:42.580]   I find when I read, I get way too into it.
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:46.060]   After 20 minutes, 20, 30 minutes, and I'm in micro.
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:48.740]   - He's saying, how do you consistently discipline yourself
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:51.080]   to macro-read without going into micro-reading?
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.320]   Sometimes it's a mix.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:56.100]   So the analogy is like you're on the freeway,
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.820]   and you're cruising at 60,
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:01.940]   and then, oh, down to 40, down to 30.
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.180]   We're rolling at five, come on.
[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:05.580]   Okay, we're back up again.
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:06.920]   It's kinda like that when you're reading.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:09.160]   It's not just maintaining the same speed,
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.360]   but you might slow down a little bit
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.600]   when you hit a patch where it's like,
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.080]   oh, this is really important.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.520]   This is really interesting.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.360]   And then you get going faster.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.080]   So it's not just one or the other.
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:21.560]   Okay, anything else?
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.400]   Any other questions?
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.220]   Right here.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:24.060]   - When you read carefully,
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.000]   do you apply it the same way
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.500]   across the three different levels?
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:27.520]   - When you read carefully,
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:28.680]   do you apply it in the same way
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.620]   across the three different levels?
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:34.960]   Yes, but you can't do it as well when you're surveying.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.200]   'Cause your analysis is going to be less accurate.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.360]   So just recognize that as you do it.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:44.760]   Okay, Mr. Siegel, how are you doing on time?
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:49.120]   One more, who would like the last question?
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:55.080]   I shouldn't have said that.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:55.920]   Made it all dry up.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.120]   Okay, you already asked one.
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.720]   All right, go ahead.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.720]   - About how many books should we aspire to read?
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.080]   - Don't think that way, yeah.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.300]   So I wouldn't count your books.
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:09.120]   My mentor, Don Carson, would say I read about 500 a year,
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.600]   but he's not counting.
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.400]   And if I told you the number I read,
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.840]   you would be impressed.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:16.920]   But I'd say don't be impressed
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.580]   because a lot of that's surveying.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:21.980]   So this isn't a competition.
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:24.960]   Just read in a way that honors the Lord
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.640]   as a good steward given what he's called you to do.
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.000]   And that's reading carefully five books a year.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.020]   If those are five really good books, that's great.
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.280]   So don't walk out of here thinking,
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.640]   "Oh, I gotta go read 50 books."
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.560]   Just think, read to enjoy, read to live,
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.240]   read to grow long-term.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.400]   All right, be encouraged.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.560]   (audience applauding)
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.140]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:01:02.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
